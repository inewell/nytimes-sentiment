      "NAIROBI, Kenya — One month after a scathing United Nations report that called for a criminal investigation likely to lead back to its leaders, Burundi has withdrawn from the International Criminal Court, becoming the first country in the world to do so.\n",
      "A United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Burundi reported in September that it had found evidence of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and sexual violence in the two-and-a-half years since Burundi’s president, Pierre Nkurunziza, muscled his way to a third term in office.\n",
      "Burundi announced its intention to withdraw last year, at a time when the court was deeply unpopular with African leaders. Gambia and South Africa were also threatening to pull out, and the continent’s top intelligence officials signed a statement accusing the court of being “hijacked by powerful western countries” and “acting as a proxy” for foreign-led government change. But Mr. Nkurunziza can no longer count on leading a wave of exits.\n",
      "Gambia reversed course on its threat after Yahya Jammeh, its president for 22 years, departed following his electoral defeat by Adama Barrow. South Africa revoked its withdrawal in March, after its High Court ruled that Parliament would have to approve the measure.\n",
      "“For the court, I continue to think this is not going to mean very much,” said Kate Cronin-Furman, a human rights lawyer and postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. “Burundi is a pretty peripheral player, and their walkout is not going to threaten the court’s legitimacy or its prospects going forward.”\n",
      "Still, the court’s reputation took a hit last year when it essentially dropped charges against Kenya’s deputy president, William Ruto, for lack of evidence. Two years earlier, it withdrew charges against Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya’s president. Both men had been accused of crimes against humanity over the violence after the country’s 2007 election, in which more than 1,100 people were killed and hundreds of thousands more were displaced.\n",
      "Nine of the 10 current formal investigations by the office of the court’s prosecutor concern Africa, and all of its trials so far have involved African defendants.\n",
      "“I think there is an ongoing concern about the court’s ability to work in countries in Africa,” said Rebecca Hamilton, an assistant professor of law at American University who previously worked in the International Criminal Court’s prosecution division.\n",
      "\n",

      "View all New York Times newsletters.\n",
      "“When you still have a government in power, we’re seeing how difficult it can be to conduct an investigation,” she added. “Where the court is interested in a rebel group or a group that’s not in power, it’s a different story. But power fights back against justice. That’s the bottom line, and that’s not unique to Africa.”\n",
      "Burundi might still end up in the court’s sights, however. Under its founding charter, known as the Rome Statute, crimes in nonmember states can still be referred for investigation by the United Nations Security Council. The United Nations’ commission of inquiry on Burundi recommended such a referral.\n",
      "The court’s work on events in Burundi has been in the exploratory stages, known as a “preliminary examination.” A spokesman for the court told The Associated Press that it would retain jurisdiction.\n",
      "It may struggle to do so, however, according to Mark Kersten, deputy director of the Wayamo Foundation, an international justice organization.\n",
      "“The rules are clearer on an investigation, but the I.C.C. hasn’t opened one,” he said. “It only has this preliminary examination.”\n",
      "For the examination to become an investigation, he said, the court’s judges would have to grant permission to the prosecutor, and Burundi might claim there was no legal basis for moving ahead after its withdrawal.\n",
      "“I think that could potentially create a lot of debate among other states,” Mr. Kersten said.\n",

      "{'frontpage': [{'title': 'How Politics and Bad Decisions Starved New York’s Subways', 'text': ' After a drumbeat of transit disasters this year, it became impossible to ignore the failures of the New York City subway system. A rush-hour Q train careened off the rails in southern Brooklyn. A track fire on the A line in Upper Manhattan sent nine riders to the hospital. A crowded F train stalled in a downtown tunnel, leaving hundreds in the dark without air-conditioning for nearly an hour. As the heat of packed-together bodies fogged the windows, passengers beat on the walls and clawed at the doors in a scene from a real-life horror story. In June, after another derailment injured 34 people, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared that the system was in a \"state of emergency.\" But the problems plaguing the subway did not suddenly sweep over the city like a tornado or a flood. They were years in the making, and they might have been avoided if decision makers had put the interests of train riders and daily operations ahead of flashy projects and financial gimmicks. An examination by The New York Times reveals in stark terms how the needs of the aging, overburdened system have grown while city and state politicians have consistently steered money away from addressing them. Century-old tunnels and track routes are crumbling, but The Times found that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s budget for subway maintenance has barely changed, when adjusted for inflation, from what it was 25 years ago. Signal problems and car equipment failures occur twice as frequently as a decade ago, but hundreds of mechanic positions have been cut because there is not enough money to pay them — even though the average total compensation for subway managers has grown to nearly $300,000 a year. Daily ridership has nearly doubled in the past two decades to 5.7 million, but New York is the only major city in the world with fewer miles of track than it had during World War II. Efforts to add new lines have been hampered by generous agreements with labor unions and private contractors that have inflated construction costs to five times the international average. New York’s subway now has the worst on-time performance of any major rapid transit system in the world, according to data collected from the 20 biggest. Just 65 percent of weekday trains reach their destinations on time, the lowest rate since the transit crisis of the 1970s, when graffiti-covered cars regularly broke down. None of this happened on its own. It was the result of a series of decisions by both Republican and Democratic politicians — governors from George E. Pataki to Mr. Cuomo and mayors from Rudolph W. Giuliani to Bill de Blasio. Each of them cut the subway’s budget or co-opted it for their own priorities. They stripped a combined $1.5 billion from the M.T.A. by repeatedly diverting tax revenues earmarked for the subways and also by demanding large payments for financial advice, I.T. help and other services that transit leaders say the authority could have done without. They pressured the M.T.A. to spend billions of dollars on opulent station makeovers and other projects that did nothing to boost service or reliability, while leaving the actual movement of trains to rely on a 1930s-era signal system with fraying, cloth-covered cables. They saddled the M.T.A. with debt and engineered a deal with creditors that brought in quick cash but locked the authority into paying $5 billion in interest that it otherwise never would have had to pay. In one particularly egregious example, Mr. Cuomo’s administration forced the M.T.A. to send $5 million to bail out three state-run ski resorts that were struggling after a warm winter. At the same time, public officials who have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in political contributions from M.T.A. unions and contractors have pressured the authority into signing agreements with labor groups and construction companies that obligated the authority to pay far more than it had planned. Faced with funding shortfalls, the M.T.A. has resorted to borrowing. Nearly 17 percent of its budget now goes to pay down debt — roughly triple what it paid in 1997. \"It’s genuinely shocking how much of every dollar that goes to the M.T.A. is spent on expenses that have nothing to do with running the subway,\" said Seth W. Pinsky, the former head of the city’s Economic Development Corporation. \"That’s the problem.\" Reporters for The Times reviewed thousands of pages of state and federal documents, including records that had not previously been made public; built databases to compare New York with other cities; and interviewed more than 300 people, including current and former subway leaders, contractors and transit experts. The examination found that the agency tasked with running the subway has been roiled by turnover and changes to its management structure. Dozens of people have cycled through high-level jobs, including many who left to work for contractors who do business with the M.T.A. Byzantine layers of bureaucracy have allowed transit leaders and politicians to avoid responsibility for problems. But the theme that runs through it all is a perennial lack of investment in tracks, trains and signals. On a good day, managing New York’s subway is a challenge. It is the largest urban transit system in the country and one of the oldest in the world. It is also one of the few to operate 24 hours every day. And in the past two decades, M.T.A. leaders have guided the authority through the Sept. 11 attacks and Hurricane Sandy, disasters from which it is still recovering. After the emergency declaration this year, the authority unveiled an $800 million rescue plan that included adding train cars and staff. But politicians and transit leaders have not acted on a series of chances to turn things around sooner. They ignored decades of warnings from state and city comptrollers. They failed to pass a congestion pricing plan in 2008. They chose not to give mass transit much of the proceeds from large settlements with banks after the financial crisis. They brushed aside the findings of the M.T.A. Transportation Reinvention Commission, a 2014 panel of transit leaders from around the world. And through it all, The Times found, the M.T.A. has used sloppy data collection and accounting games that hide from the public the true causes of the subway’s problems. Much of this story unfolds in the musty pages of budgets and contracts. But under the jargon and numbers is a world of misery. New Yorkers who depend on the subways are missing court hearings, arriving late for medical appointments, losing out on jobs or being robbed of time with their children. Last year, for the first time in decades, the number of people riding the subway actually slightly declined — an astounding development in a growing city with a booming economy. \"It’s heartbreaking,\" said David L. Gunn, a former transit system president who helped drag the subways out of the 1970s crisis only to see the system deteriorate again. \"I actually lose sleep over it. I get so mad when I see what’s happening.\" While many politicians have contributed to the decline of the subway over the years, the problems reached a fever pitch under Mr. Cuomo, who as governor appoints the M.T.A. chairman and effectively controls the authority. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is expected to seek a third term next year and is also seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2020, tried to stave off the emergency by committing additional funding to capital construction and getting involved in decisions about how to spend it. But several transit leaders said that the interference backfired, and that the governor would have helped more if he had introduced any legislation to boost funding for core maintenance. In a statement, Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, said the governor was dedicated to improving the M.T.A., including by ensuring a record $8.5 billion in state funding for capital needs. Ms. Lever acknowledged that the subway was in \"unacceptable disrepair\" but argued that politicians and transit leaders had done their best with limited resources and a flawed agency. She said the problems stemmed from a lack of accountability caused by the city and suburbs having seats on the M.T.A. board, and the city and Legislature having power to veto capital spending. \"A camel is a horse designed by committee, and the M.T.A. is a train service run by committee,\" Ms. Lever said. On July 17, Chétina Muteba tried to catch a train from Inwood, in Upper Manhattan, to her office in Midtown. Everything that happened next, every seemingly tiny event that turned her commute into a frustrating crawl beneath the city, could be traced to decisions made in Albany and City Hall years before. It was just another day in what had become a maddening summer for the city’s subway riders. Ms. Muteba, a 32-year-old advertising strategist, was thinking about a meeting she was supposed to attend that Monday morning when she saw that her usual entrance to the 207th Street station on the A line was taped off. \"There was just someone who was working there, on the outside, on the street,\" Ms. Muteba said. \"He said, ‘Hey, it’s a block ticket,’ and I said, ‘I don’t know what a block ticket means.’ And he said, ‘You have to transfer.’\" No one told her that a fire, caused by debris on the A line track near 145th Street in Harlem, was slowing whole stretches of the subway. The humidity that day hovered around 70 percent, and the temperature was climbing toward 85 degrees as Ms. Muteba headed to a 1 line stop down 207th Street. Drawing closer, she saw a long line snaking up the stairs to the elevated station. It was moving only incrementally, like an assembly line feeding into a broken factory. She took her place at the end. When she reached the platform, she found that trains that usually arrived every four or five minutes now seemed to be coming 10 minutes apart. She pushed onto one and felt lucky to find a seat. It stopped at Dyckman Street, and she braced herself as an enormous number of people got on. As Ms. Muteba fought to get to work, other commuter dramas were playing out across the system. For years, officials had only partly funded signal repairs and replacements. Much of the subway’s signaling equipment was decades beyond its life span. Just a few months before Ms. Muteba’s ill-fated commute, the M.T.A. had cut signal funding by $500 million to support projects favored by Mr. Cuomo. Internal M.T.A. records show that on the morning of July 17, at least 124 delays were caused by signal issues on the 2, 4, E, F, G, J and M lines. Nearly a decade earlier, a budget crunch had led M.T.A. officials to relax standards for vehicle inspections and overhauls and allow maintenance jobs to go unfilled. At least 24 delays across the city that morning had roots in malfunctioning motors, faulty brakes or broken air-conditioning systems, records show. And the M.T.A. had saved more money by putting off track maintenance not deemed absolutely essential. At least 55 delays stemmed from track problems that morning — not counting the fire that was slowing Ms. Muteba’s commute. By the time her 1 train left 168th Street, the car was impossibly full. She was not unfamiliar with feeling crowded, having taken the subway since 2011. But now people on the train were packed so tightly that it triggered a flight reflex. It took her until 137th Street to elbow her way out. Standing in the heat on the platform amid a horde of frustrated commuters, she instantly regretted it. Records show that ahead of the 1 trains creeping south that morning, a sick rider was causing problems at 96th Street and a passenger riding between cars was stirring trouble at 72nd. To save money years earlier, the M.T.A. had eliminated its practice of positioning people trained in medical aid at some busy stations. As one train and then another were held up at two of the busiest express stops in the city, waiting for emergency responders, it deepened the anguish for Ms. Muteba — and for untold thousands of others up the line. Three trains passed her at 137th Street before she found one that she could squeeze onto. By the time she got to her stop, her 30-minute commute had taken nearly two hours. She emerged with a meeting to reschedule and a resolution never to rely on the A train again. Ms. Muteba said she commiserated with fellow riders that morning. \"There was a lot of discussion about, ‘What are we paying for?’\" New York’s subway system has always struggled to get the money it needs. Decades of cost-cutting and deferred maintenance led to the darkest days in the history of the 113-year-old system: the crisis in the 1970s, when the subway became a symbol of urban decay. Officials rescued the subway with a simple formula: Invest in the system, and it will improve. After more than a decade of spending, about $50 billion in today’s dollars, reliability soared. Cars traveled 10 times farther before breaking down. Riders returned in droves. It was a golden era; New York and its subway seemed to be on the rise together. Then, records show, officials pulled back. It started with New York City’s mayors. While the M.T.A., the sprawling organization that operates the New York subway and bus lines, two commuter railroads and several bridges, is run by the state, the subway is owned by the city. In addition to creating confusion, this dynamic sparks funding battles. Historically, the city has funded about 10 percent of the M.T.A.’s total budget. Mr. Giuliani decided to change that in 1994, when he became the city’s first Republican mayor in two decades. Facing a budget shortfall and eager to show he could run the city without raising taxes, he announced he would cut the city’s contribution to the M.T.A.’s operating and capital budgets by $400 million. Mr. Giuliani defended the reduction by calling the authority bloated and noting that it had a surplus the previous year — but he did not suggest any reforms to increase efficiency. Critics were outraged. Hundreds protested at public hearings, chanting, \"No more cuts!\" At one hearing in Manhattan, attendees waved posters depicting a two-headed mutant with the faces of the mayor and Mr. Pataki, who was proposing his own cuts. \"Monster That Ate Mass Transit,\" the posters said. \"We’ve spent 10 years clawing our way back,\" one M.T.A. official said at the time. \"You’ve only begun to turn the corner. It would be easy to go backward.\" The mayor made the cuts nonetheless. Despite the consternation, the reductions did not immediately cause problems. That paved the way for other city and state politicians to make more cuts. Mr. Giuliani did not return multiple messages seeking comment. His successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, used city funds to help finance bonds for a development project — the extension of the 7 line to the Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan. But he otherwise left subway funding where it was, which effectively cut the city’s contribution by not allowing it to keep up with inflation. A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, Marc La Vorgna, said the former mayor contributed by fighting vigorously to get the state to adopt a congestion pricing plan that would have provided a huge amount of revenue. \"It’s hard to argue any mayor in history has made a greater effort to improve the M.T.A.,\" he said. Mr. de Blasio has been hands off. He committed $2.5 billion in city funds for the M.T.A.’s capital program, but he rebuffed requests to increase operating subsidies and has declined to provide money for the authority’s plan to address the delays. During town hall meetings, he often quizzes attendees to ensure they know the city does not run the subway. A City Hall spokeswoman, Freddi Goldstein, said the de Blasio administration \"has contributed its fair share year after year.\" Ms. Goldstein noted that the city’s police officers patrol subway stations and that its residents provide most of the M.T.A.’s tax revenue. \"What the City of New York contributes daily is bigger than the budget alone can show,\" she said. Still, the budget shows that the city’s contribution to M.T.A. operations has dropped by almost 75 percent. In today’s dollars, the city gave the M.T.A. roughly $1 billion in operating funding in 1990. This year, not counting money for managing some formerly city-run buses, the city gave the system about $250 million. The mayors stuck to the cuts despite a surge in property values that the subways helped create. New York real estate values — and property tax revenues — have quintupled since the early 1990s, according to the Independent Budget Office. None of that increased property tax revenue was earmarked for the subways. If the city’s cuts hindered the subway, the state’s actions practically hobbled it. Lawmakers in Albany trimmed funding for subway maintenance throughout the 1990s, records show, even as the state budget grew from $45 billion to $80 billion. Then they kept funding mostly flat for years, despite the surge in ridership. Under Mr. Pataki, the state eliminated subsidies for the M.T.A., opting to make the authority rely entirely on fares, tolls and revenue from taxes and fees earmarked for transit. It also ended state funding for capital work. The move rankled the state comptroller at the time, H. Carl McCall, who warned that taxes and fees were unstable. Mr. Pataki also started a trend of redirecting revenues from taxes. In 1995, he pushed through a state income tax cut and helped pay for it by taking more than $200 million in tax revenues that had been set aside for transit. His three successors followed suit. At least $850 million has been diverted in the past two decades, records show. Richard Ravitch, the former lieutenant governor and M.T.A. chairman who came up with the idea for many of the dedicated taxes as part of his plan to save the subways in the 1980s, said it never occurred to him that the state would redirect the revenue. \"It’s very disappointing,\" Mr. Ravitch said, adding that the diversions were just another in a long list of examples of politicians taking the subway for granted and neglecting to invest in its health. \"This is the lifeblood of the city,\" he said. \"Everybody depends on it. And yet nobody cares about it enough to think more than four years ahead. They only want to think about the next election. Nobody is thinking about the future.\" Budget shortfalls have led transit leaders to routinely raise fares to stay afloat. The subway now derives more than 60 percent of its funding from fares, a higher rate than almost any other transit system in North America. Perhaps nothing has hamstrung the M.T.A. more than a maneuver Mr. Pataki introduced in 2000. That year, Bear Stearns, then a Wall Street powerhouse, approached the governor with a proposal to alleviate an M.T.A. budget crunch: If the authority refinanced $12 billion of its debt, the bank said, it could get a huge influx of cash without having to pay for years. Within weeks, a Bear Stearns executive was pitching the idea to skeptical lawmakers in a marathon meeting at the State Capitol. Critics denounced the move, saying it was a \"debt bomb\" that would hurt future generations. But the lawmakers eventually signed off, and the M.T.A. agreed to the deal in 2002. The bankers and bond underwriters — many of whom had ties to Mr. Pataki or had donated to his campaign — earned an estimated $85 million. Mr. Pataki did not return messages seeking comment. Today, bonds have become the biggest funding source for M.T.A.’s construction needs. The authority has borrowed about $15 billion in the past six years — about 52 percent of overall capital funding, records show. In the 1980s, only about 30 percent of capital work was financed by debt. The current state budget director, Robert Mujica, who was appointed by Mr. Cuomo, said it was sensible for the M.T.A. to borrow more today because interest rates are much lower than in the 1980s. \"Using debt is a responsible way to invest in assets that are going to last a long time,\" he said. Still, most other American transit systems fund their capital work more by government financing than borrowing. Like the budget cuts in the 1990s, the borrowing did not immediately wreak havoc on the subway. But more than two dozen current and former M.T.A. officials said that years of underinvestment caught up to the system by the mid-2000s. Reliability plunged, they said, and it kept plunging even when Gov. David A. Paterson and Mr. Ravitch raised tax rates to benefit the authority. \"They figured that the subway was fixed, and so they stopped thinking about it,\" said a former budget director at the M.T.A., Gary G. Caplan. \"You can only stop funding something for so long before it breaks. That’s what happened.\" The subway’s budget has not only been squeezed. It has been milked. Fees demanded by the state for bond advice are a prime example. A bill passed by the Legislature in 1989 included a provision that lets state officials impose a fee on bonds issued by public authorities. The fee was largely intended to compensate the state for helping understaffed authorities navigate the borrowing process. It was to be a small charge, no more than 0.2 percent of the value of bond issuances. \"It was not widely discussed, I can tell you that,\" said Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester who served in the Assembly from 1983 to 2010, including as chairman of the authorities committee. \"I don’t think anybody noticed it at all.\" The charge has quietly grown into a revenue stream for the state. And a lot of the money has been sapped from one authority in particular: the M.T.A. The authority — a sophisticated operation that contracts with multiple bond experts — has had to pay $328 million in bond issuance fees over the past 15 years. In some years, it has been charged fees totaling nearly 1 percent of its bond issuances, far more than foreseen under the original law. The Times uncovered the payments by piecing together state and authority records and interviewing current and former M.T.A. officials. Mr. Mujica, the state budget director, defended the payments, saying that his staff meets \"periodically\" with the M.T.A. and its bond counsel \"to work out the timing of what they’re doing.\" He also said the fees were routinely paid by all authorities. But records show that other agencies have had tens of millions of dollars in bond issuance fees waived, including the Dormitory Authority, which is often used as a vehicle for pork projects pushed by the governor or lawmakers. The M.T.A. has not benefited as often from waivers. Mr. Brodsky called the charges \"unsavory\" — especially because state funding cuts forced the M.T.A. to issue the bonds in the first place. \"They’re using the public authority system as a piggy bank,\" he said. After questions from a Times reporter, Mr. Mujica said the state would no longer impose bond issuance fees on the M.T.A. This was just one way that officials redirected M.T.A. money that could have gone toward fixing the subway. The remaking of the Fulton Street station in Manhattan was another. Damaged during the Sept. 11 attacks, the station was eligible for federal renovation money when Sheldon Silver took it up as a cause. Mr. Silver, who was then Assembly speaker and one of the state’s most powerful politicians, envisioned not just a subway station in his district but a soaring transit hub, \"the Grand Central of Downtown,\" complete with an enormous glass dome and mirrors to filter sunlight into underground passageways. By 2008, the cost had shot past its original $750 million budget, and M.T.A. leaders decided to scale back the project. But Mr. Silver sent a letter threatening to veto the authority’s funding if he did not get what he wanted. The M.T.A. quickly fell in line. In the end, the project cost $1.4 billion — more than the total annual budget of Chicago’s rapid transit system — and did nothing to improve the subway’s signals or tracks. Mr. Silver, who stepped down as speaker in 2015 after being charged in a federal corruption case, declined to comment. There have also been costly overhauls at other stations. Bleecker Street in Manhattan got improvements, including a neon light display, at a cost of $135 million — more than twice the initial estimate. The remodel of the Cortlandt Street station in Manhattan, also destroyed in the 2001 attacks, is still not finished, despite $66 million in spending so far. Last year, Mr. Cuomo pushed the M.T.A. to spend nearly $1 billion on enhanced lighting, signs, countdown clocks and other upgrades at dozens of stations, many of which were not considered most in need of rehabilitation by M.T.A. leaders. The project, called the Enhanced Station Initiative, did not include funding to make all the stations comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act. Mr. Cuomo also pressured the authority to spend tens of millions of dollars to study outfitting M.T.A. bridges with lights capable of choreographed display, install wireless internet and phone-charging ports on buses and paint the state logo on new subway cars. Joseph J. Lhota, whom Mr. Cuomo appointed M.T.A. chairman in June, defended the spending. \"Service and reliability shouldn’t just be while passengers are on the train. It should be while they’re on the platform,\" he said, adding that not having phone-charging ports was unacceptable in the 21st century. But Roger Toussaint, who ran the M.T.A.’s main union from 2001 to 2009, said the spending reflected a pattern of focusing on flashy projects over maintenance. \"The spinal cord of the subway system is the ability to move trains — signals, power and the actual track and infrastructure,\" Mr. Toussaint said. \"They haven’t been spending money on the spine. They’ve been spending money on the limbs.\" The state has also made the M.T.A. bail out other entities in need of help, including the state-run ski resorts. The $5 million was sent in March last year, after a warm winter in which the Belleayre Ski Center, Gore Mountain and Whiteface Mountain saw a 25 percent decrease in visitors. In 2013, the M.T.A. was made to send $5 million to an affiliate agency, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, to cover the cost of reducing tolls. M.T.A. board members, who learned of the ski-resort bailout from an article in The New York Daily News, hired a law firm to investigate the payments. The firm concluded they probably were legal, according to records shared with The Times, but several members said they were inappropriate nonetheless. \"It would have been far more responsible for the state to have left that money with the M.T.A. I love skiing, but if you want to ski at a state-owned ski resort, buy a lift ticket,\" said James E. Vitiello, an appointee of the Dutchess County executive. Mr. Vitiello is among several board members who have complained that the governor has taken a stronger role in the authority and limited their ability to direct policy. During this period of spending, subway performance slid. The percentage of trains arriving at their destinations more than five minutes late — the M.T.A.’s cutoff for whether a trip is \"on time\" — has increased in 14 of the past 15 years. \"Mean distance between failure,\" the measure of how frequently trains break down, has worsened almost every year since 2010. The financial crisis in 2008 intensified the problems, in part because of the M.T.A.’s reliance on taxes and fees. Among other issues, revenue from a real estate transfer tax plunged by 75 percent — leaving the authority scrambling to deal with a $1 billion drop in revenue. The M.T.A. curtailed 40 types of maintenance. Among other moves, it lengthened schedules for routine work on most cars from about every 66 days to every 73, and schedules for comprehensive overhauls from every six years to every seven. Mr. Lhota said the cuts, which have never been restored, were the biggest reason for the rising delays. \"The maintenance intervals were stretched, and they were stretched too far,\" he said. Hurricane Sandy struck a few years later. The M.T.A. drew praise for its response, but transit leaders said the storm took resources away from routine maintenance. Mr. Cuomo had steered clear of the M.T.A. during his first years in office, but in his second term he took an intense interest. He placed aides within the organization and, in an unusual move, made some report directly to him. He badgered transit leaders about the construction of the Second Avenue subway on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And over the objections of some board members, he canceled several M.T.A. capital projects to make room for his own priorities. According to high-ranking current and former M.T.A. officials, the moves interfered with the authority’s plans to address the rising delays. They also bothered the respected former M.T.A. chairman Thomas F. Prendergast, who retired in January. Mr. Prendergast said his retirement was not related to the governor, but several of his former colleagues said it was a factor. Even in the face of the financial crisis and budget shortfalls, the M.T.A. has given concession after concession to its main labor union. Members of the Transport Workers Union got a total of 19 percent in pay raises between 2009 and 2016, compared with 12 percent for the city’s teachers union over the same period. The labor contracts also gave members lifetime spousal health benefits and free rides on the Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road. (They already were allowed to ride the subway for free.) According to a former union president, John Samuelsen, the organization has secured better deals over the past eight years than any other public labor group in New York. \"I look back with satisfaction on what, together, we have accomplished,\" Mr. Samuelsen said in a September letter announcing that he was becoming the union’s international president. Each of three deals signed from 2009 to 2017 cost more than the M.T.A. anticipated, forcing it to take money from other parts of the budget. The 2014 deal, which cost $525 million, was funded by tapping into a pay-as-you-go account that was intended to pay for capital work, former officials said. Subway workers now make an average of $170,000 annually in salary, overtime and benefits, according to a Times analysis of data compiled by the federal Department of Transportation. That is far more than in any other American transit system; the average in cities like Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington is about $100,000 in total compensation annually. The pay for managers is even more extraordinary. The nearly 2,500 people who work in New York subway administration make, on average, $280,000 in salary, overtime and benefits. The average elsewhere is $115,000. New York is more expensive than most other cities, but not by that much. The latest estimate from the federal Department of Commerce said the region’s cost of living was 22 percent higher than the national average and 10 percent higher than the average for other areas with subways. Mr. Samuelsen rejected the idea that subway workers were overpaid, arguing that it is a dangerous job in which assault is common. \"We earn every penny that we make,\" he said. \"This is New York City. This isn’t Mayberry. It costs $700,000 to buy a house in Brooklyn. What do you want us to make? Fifteen dollars an hour?\" Union rules also drive up costs, including by requiring two M.T.A. employees on every train — one to drive, and one to oversee boarding. Virtually every other subway in the world staffs trains with only one worker; if New York did that, it would save nearly $200 million a year, according to an internal M.T.A. analysis obtained by The Times. Several M.T.A. officials involved in negotiating recent contracts said that there was one reason they accepted the union’s terms: Mr. Cuomo. The governor, who is closely aligned with the union and has received $165,000 in campaign contributions from the labor group, once dispatched a top aide to deliver a message, they said. Pay the union and worry about finding the money later, the aide said, according to two former M.T.A. officials who were in the room. Mr. Cuomo’s office said in a statement that the M.T.A. handled its own labor negotiations and that campaign contributions had not influenced any of his actions. The cost of increasing delays can be measured not only in numbers, but also in painful absences on special occasions, lost wages and blown opportunities. Over the summer, The Times asked readers to share their experiences with the subway. More than 1,000 responded, mostly with stories of sorrow. Ashley Patterson, 24, from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, began having anxiety attacks on the subway this summer and now follows a careful routine to keep calm during delays. \"I think that that’s something that the M.T.A. should be thinking about,\" Ms. Patterson said. \"It’s not just about the inconvenience of being late to work. There’s this mental health aspect.\" Laura Hernandez, 34, a city employee from Woodside, Queens, missed an appointment to inspect the housing conditions of the clients of a social service agency. \"I am a new employee on probation, and it does not look good to arrive over an hour late for an appointment,\" Ms. Hernandez said. Juliana S. Karol, 30, from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is a rabbinical student at Hebrew Union College downtown. She was late to a meeting to discuss her senior thesis, ordination and job placement. She was also 38 weeks pregnant. \"I actually ended up writing my High Holy Days sermon about the subway,\" Ms. Karol said. \"About the opportunities that the subway crisis gives us to reframe both the gratitude we have when things are going right and how we respond when they are not.\" The entire fifth-grade class at Public School 32 in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, had to cancel a field trip to see a movie — a reward for completing math exams. \"They had actually gone to the station, and they just ended up waiting forever,\" said Dawn Reed, 52, whose son was one of the disappointed students. She said she used the experience to teach him about managing expectations. \"It’s getting progressively worse,\" she said of the subway. \"And delays are a part of life, and it’s difficult to have any sense of consistency.\" Ariel Leigh Cohen, 26, from Sunnyside, Queens, missed an interview for a job painting scenery for a major Broadway show. It would have paid twice her salary as a salon receptionist and brought her closer to her dream of working in show business. \"I was trying to change my life and do what I came to New York to do,\" Ms. Cohen said. \"It would’ve opened up another world of possibilities. Opportunities like that don’t come around often at all.\" And then there are stories like Rosalie Osian’s. A chaplain who comforts the terminally ill for Caring Hospice Services, Ms. Osian, 58, got word one Friday that a patient was dying in Brooklyn, and she struck out on a 2 train from 72nd Street in Manhattan. She made it as far as Fulton Street downtown before an announcement told her to switch to the 4 or 5. Problems on that line forced her to switch trains again, and at one point she was left standing on a platform, racked by the need to be with the patient and prepare the family for grief and pending loss. She was late getting there but made it before the patient died. \"I’m not the only one,\" Ms. Osian said. \"There are people traveling the city all day helping people. There are home health aides and others. And if the subways are delayed, they can’t get to their work.\" Although riders have bemoaned delays on the subway for years, they often have no idea what is causing them. This is a byproduct of 30 years of transit officials seeking to avoid blame for the system’s problems, The Times found. Every day, officials collect data that could be used to improve the system. For every incident that causes a delay, workers are supposed to log the time, location, duration, cause and department responsible. In theory, the data could be studied to identify patterns in delays and shed light on how they might be fixed. That has not happened. In 1986, the M.T.A.’s inspector general discovered that the delay records were \"seriously flawed\" — and shot through with biased reporting, unauthorized adjustments, illegible entries and omissions. In the 1990s, investigators twice concluded that the count was riddled with errors and misrepresentations. John Gaul, then the assistant chief of rapid transit operations, acknowledged at the time that the process was susceptible to fraud because operators were being asked to collect data on their own performances. \"In many cases, undue pressure had been imposed on supervisors in the field to meet on-time performance goals,\" he said. Three former high-ranking subway officials told The Times that little had changed since the 1980s. Before final delay reports are issued, M.T.A. departments argue about who should be blamed. Sometimes, the reports reflect more on a department’s arguing ability than on its actual performance. The officials also said that different tactics had been used over the years to avoid culpability. From September 2009 to May 2010, records show, some 530,000 delays — 80 percent of all delays recorded — were lumped into a category called \"supplement schedule.\" The officials said that whenever maintenance work in the system caused a scheduling change, virtually all delays were put under this label, regardless of their cause. In recent years, the M.T.A. has stopped using the category. Today, M.T.A. documents say that the most common cause of delays is \"overcrowding.\" More than 111,000 delays were put into that category in the first four months of 2017 alone. That was 37 percent of all delays. New York politicians and transit leaders have seized on the figures to suggest that most of the subway’s problems come down to its popularity. But the M.T.A.’s own records call that into question. In March 2015, records show, more than 153 million trips were recorded, making it one of the busiest months on record. There were 19,000 delays attributed to overcrowding. Last March, two million fewer rides were recorded, but 30,000 delays were said to be caused by overcrowding. Mr. Lhota said that quirks existed in all data and that M.T.A. officials handled the classification consistently. He rejected any suggestion that officials were manipulating numbers to make themselves look better or blame customers for problems. \"The delays are solely the responsibility of the New York City Transit Authority,\" he said, referring to the agency that runs the subway. Still, the murkiness of what is truly causing delays only feeds frustration for riders like Ms. Muteba, the advertising strategist whose 30-minute commute became a two-hour odyssey of packed cars and angry riders after a track fire in July. Though the number of passengers on the 1 line swelled temporarily that morning because riders were avoiding the blocked A train, dozens of delays were not attributed to the track fire. They were attributed to overcrowding, records show. \"You’re just kind of like, ‘It’s a lost cause,’\" Ms. Muteba said. \"It’s kind of like beating a dead horse.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/nyregion/new-york-subway-system-failure-delays.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Why a Firm Believer in Tax Cuts Could Derail the Senate Tax Cut Plan', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — On the eve of the House’s vote to pass a far-reaching $1.5 trillion tax cut, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin placed a hasty phone call to his state’s senior senator, Ron Johnson, in hopes of resolving an unlikely conflict in his own back yard. Mr. Johnson had become the first Senate Republican to say publicly that he could not vote for the Senate’s version of the tax bill. During the phone call on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Ryan, who had campaigned heavily for Mr. Johnson in 2016, posed an essential question, according to the senator: \"What are you going to need?\" What Mr. Johnson needs, he said in an interview from Wisconsin on Friday, is for the bill to treat more favorably small businesses and other so-called pass-through entities — businesses whose profits are distributed to their owners and taxed at rates for individuals. Such entities, including Mr. Johnson’s family-run plastics manufacturing business, account for more than half of the nation’s business income, and the senator says the tax bill would give an unfair advantage to larger corporations. \"I just have in my heart a real affinity for these owner-operated pass-throughs,\" he said. \"We need to make American businesses competitive — they’re not right now. But in making businesses competitive, we can’t leave behind the pass-throughs.\" The sudden fissure between longtime allies laid bare the challenge that Republicans face as the tax bill leaves Mr. Ryan’s care and navigates the rough waters of the Senate, where different priorities within the party could sink the bill if not adequately addressed. Senate Republican leaders, who are seeking a major legislative victory before year’s end, hope to bring their tax bill, which differs significantly from the House measure, to a vote after Thanksgiving. But it is unclear whether it has enough support to pass in the narrowly divided chamber. Offering concessions to skeptical senators one by one could prove an impossible task for Republican leaders, who face restraints under Senate rules on the total size of the tax cut package. Those leaders are hoping, instead, that they can pull off a version of Mr. Ryan’s strategy: all but daring holdouts to derail the party’s top priority. Republicans, who control Congress and the White House, are desperately seeking their first significant legislative achievement of the Trump presidency. Mr. Johnson’s public wavering elicited calls from President Trump and a visit from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, chairman of the National Economic Council, all of whom sounded out Mr. Johnson about his concerns. Mr. Johnson is a firm believer in the power of tax cuts to lift economic growth. He grew up on a Minnesota farm, worked as an accountant after college, and spent more than 30 years immersed in his family’s plastics company before assuming his Senate seat in 2010. Since winning re-election in 2016, he has not shied from voicing displeasure with the Republican leadership. He was an early and vocal critic of the party’s legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, though he ultimately voted in favor of the bill. His concerns with the Senate’s tax bill stem not from its overarching goal of cutting taxes but with how the bill treats small businesses and large corporations. Mr. Johnson says the legislation is tilted in favor of big companies, and he is eager to find a way to level the playing field. Mr. Ryan, who was his party’s 2012 vice-presidential nominee, helped Mr. Johnson’s ascendance to the Senate. Mr. Ryan barnstormed Wisconsin on Mr. Johnson’s behalf as his come-from-behind re-election bid took off last year, and the two have forged a bond in Washington. \"You know what we control, with Ron Johnson’s election?\" Mr. Ryan asked the crowd at a rally the night before the election. \"We in Wisconsin control who controls the United States Senate. If you want to see anything get done — pass it in the House, get it from the Senate and get it on a Republican president’s desk and get it into law — Ron Johnson’s got to get re-elected.\" But the dynamics of the two chambers differ markedly. With the House tax bill, Mr. Ryan and other Republican leaders employed a command-and-control process and a rocket-speed schedule to minimize Republican dissent. The strategy worked: The bill sailed through the House on Thursday along party lines, two weeks after it was introduced. In the Senate, where the party’s margins are much smaller and individual members are more powerful, party leaders will need to win over what could be a half-dozen or more wavering Republicans, beginning with Mr. Johnson. Others include Senators Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and John McCain. The Senate bill cleared the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday night. Before he can support it, Mr. Johnson said, he wants to see changes in its treatment of pass-through entities to put them on equal footing with corporations. While rates would fall for Mr. Johnson’s family business under the Senate bill, they would not fall as much as those for larger businesses. More than 90 percent of American businesses are pass-throughs. The Senate bill would give pass-through owners a 17.4 percent deduction on their income taxes, while cutting the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The special deduction means the owner of a high-profit pass-through would pay an effective top rate of about 32 percent, well above what a traditional corporation would pay. The pass-through treatment has earned the endorsement of the National Federation of Independent Business, the powerful lobbying group for small businesses. \"We very much like the Senate bill — it’s a really good deal for the vast majority of pass-through businesses,\" said Jack Mozloom, a spokesman for the group. \"Based on our analysis, we think it’s going to provide them with a substantial tax cut.\" Mr. Johnson launched the family’s plastics sheeting company in 1979 with his brother-in-law. Over the course of his career, he said, he has seen many family-run companies — his customers — be snapped up by larger corporations, or fold after being unable to compete with them. He said that the tax code unfairly advantaged those corporations, and that the Senate tax bill would widen those advantages, by cutting corporate taxes more substantially than those for pass-through businesses. Mr. Johnson’s preferred approach to that imbalance would be to force all corporations to become pass-throughs, a move he says would equalize tax treatment and encourage more corporate investment. He says this approach would not personally benefit him because it would not cut taxes on pass-throughs; Mr. Johnson earned between $215,000 and just over $2 million in pass-through income in 2016, through several limited liability companies. But Mr. Johnson concedes that his Republican colleagues do not seem likely to add such a provision to their tax bill. \"Unfortunately,\" he said, \"it’s pretty late in the game.\" And so the question becomes: What changes would he accept? Republican leaders will probably need to pose that question to several senators in the days to come. Mr. Flake, of Arizona, and Mr. Corker, of Tennessee, have raised concerns over how much the bill would add to the budget deficit, particularly if Republicans do not allow all individual — and pass-through — tax breaks to expire at the end of 2025, as the bill currently calls for. Ms. Murkowski, of Alaska, said on Friday that if the bill continued to include a repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to buy health insurance, she would prefer that Congress first pass a different bill to help stabilize insurance markets. \"However,\" she said in a statement, \"one should not assume this is a precondition for my support for the tax bill.\" Mr. Johnson suggested in the interview that if the Senate did not force all companies to operate as pass-throughs, it should at least cut their taxes further to equalize their treatment with larger corporations. Such cuts, he acknowledged, would be expensive in terms of lost tax revenues, and Republicans must stay within the $1.5 trillion limit for additional deficits in order to pass the tax bill on a party-line vote. The senator said he would have preferred if Republicans, in an earlier budget bill, had set that limit higher, at $2 trillion or $3 trillion. For now, Mr. Johnson said he was gathering information and trying to work with administration officials on identifying the group of pass-through companies that most need additional help. \"I’m optimistic\" that solutions will be found, Mr. Johnson said, \"because we all understand how important this is. I don’t want to block this. There’s no way I want to block this.\" Senate leaders are counting on that attitude, as they try to replicate Mr. Ryan’s success in the House. They believe that on a core conservative issue, at a time when the party is still searching for a signature legislative victory under Mr. Trump, no senator will want to be the one who blocks the bill. They also note that even though Mr. Johnson raised similarly loud concerns over the party’s failed health care bill earlier this year, in the end, he voted for it.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/us/politics/ron-johnson-senate-tax-cut.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'For Roy Moore, a Long History of Combat and Controversy', 'text': ' GADSDEN, Ala. — It was 1982, and four circuit judges from rural Etowah County, Ala., had filed a state bar complaint against a lawyer named Roy S. Moore, accusing him of running \"slanderous\" political ads that had portrayed the local legal system as corrupt. The response from the 35-year-old Mr. Moore, who had just lost his own effort to win a judgeship, was infused with the kind of crusading righteousness — his critics would call it sanctimony — that would later fuel his rise to national fame. \"If the judges of Etowah County are personally offended, that is their problem, not mine,\" he declared in a letter addressing the judges’ complaint. Mr. Moore added a line from Proverbs: \"The guilty flee when no man pursueth.\" Today, rather than flee, or at least quit his race for the Senate, as many are demanding, Mr. Moore is declaring his innocence and charging ahead despite allegations of improper sexual behavior. The current furor, in which numerous women have come forward alleging that he approached, dated, or in some cases sexually assaulted them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, has played out like a concentrated version of Mr. Moore’s combative history, in which he rose to national prominence as an unyielding spokesman for conservative and religious values. Mr. Moore, a Republican, has responded with the same defiance that he exhibited when he was twice removed from his post as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, first for dismissing a federal court order to remove a 5,280-pound granite monument of the Ten Commandments he had installed in the state judicial building, and later for flouting the United States Supreme Court’s decision affirming gay marriage. For good measure, he has declared that homosexuality should be illegal, and that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. Mr. Moore first made a name for himself as a prosecutor and an anti-establishment political outsider here in Gadsden in the years after 1977, when he returned to Etowah County after an education at West Point, a tour of duty in Vietnam and law school in Tuscaloosa. He already had the contentiousness, if not the overt religiosity. During those years, he was developing another reputation, passed along in whispers. Now they have grown to a roar, threatening to derail what might have been a cakewalk political contest in deeply conservative Alabama. \"It was a known fact: Roy Moore liked young girls,\" said Faye Gary, a retired Gadsden police officer. \"It was treated like a joke. That’s just the way it was.\" One of the women, Leigh Corfman, said she was 14 years old when Mr. Moore engaged in a sexual encounter with her. \"I stand by my story,\" said Ms. Corfman, whose account first appeared in The Washington Post. Mr. Moore has denied any impropriety with Ms. Corfman or any other woman. After coming home, Mr. Moore landed a job as an assistant district attorney. M. D. Garmon, a former reporter for The Gadsden Times, remembered him as eager to shake things up. \"He didn’t want to be in the clique of judges and the attorneys apparently,\" Mr. Garmon said. \"He was sort of standoffish to them, which in turn affected their treatment of him.\" Mr. Moore was rarely seen in the places where lawyers would routinely gather to swap gossip, said James Sledge, a former federal judge who was a lawyer at the time. Few remember him out and about socially. He is, however, remembered as a common presence at the Y.M.C.A. and the Gadsden Mall. As with everything concerning Mr. Moore, accounts vary. Alice Bircheat, the longtime bookkeeper at the Y.M.C.A., said that she recalled \"not one complaint\" about Mr. Moore. Terry White, 70, a former Gadsden police officer who worked security at the mall, said, \"Nobody, as far as I know, ever complained.\" Myron K. Allenstein, a local lawyer who rented office space to Mr. Moore and later tried cases with him, insisted that Mr. Moore was a man of unimpeachable character. \"He’s real down to earth but feels real strongly about what he believes,\" he said. Mr. Allenstein noted that he was a Democrat who planned to vote for Mr. Moore in the Dec. 12 election. But numerous people remembered otherwise. They recalled Mr. Moore working out at the Y.M.C.A. gym, often shirtless. Delores Abney, 63, said she recalled Mr. Moore talking to women that \"appeared to be high school on up\" in an exercise class she was enrolled in. \"It just did not look appropriate.\" Janet Reeves, 57, a former employee of a photo kiosk and an Orange Julius at the mall, talked of Mr. Moore asking a friend of hers, who she recalled was 17 or 18, for her phone number. \"I just thought he was the creepy old guy,\" she said. Glenn Day, 64, who managed two stores at the mall in those years, recalled that Mr. Moore had such reputation for approaching young women that the mall guard asked him to let security know whenever he saw Mr. Moore there. \"I can’t believe there’s such an outcry now,\" Mr. Day said, \"about something everybody knew.\" Mr. Moore declined to comment. In a campaign message Friday evening, he said that the allegations were part of a plot by liberals and certain Republicans, which \"shows how much the establishment flat-out hates our conservative Christian values.\" In his 2005 memoir, \"So Help Me God,\" Mr. Moore described his battles with the local establishment, and acknowledged that it made him enemies. He criticized laws that let criminals out for \"good time\" served, the bail bond system, and planned budget cuts to the sheriff’s department. He sued the county when it declined him raises he was due. He was rocking the boat, he wrote, \"and none of the other passengers seemed happy.\" People who grew up with him suggest his polarizing reputation goes back further than his days as a county prosecutor. \"He was very bright,\" said Janet Hinton, who was two years behind Mr. Moore in high school. She remembered him coming from a poor family that struggled to get by. He was also, she said, \"known as a real bragger who acted like the smartest person in the classroom.\" Twenty years later, he was inspiring some of the same strong feelings, alienating much of the Gadsden legal community and provoking local judges to take the rare step of filing bar complaints against him. (The complaints were eventually closed without action being taken.) An unsuccessful run for county judge in 1982, though giving voters a taste of the hard-line populism that would later draw a national fan base, only seemed to leave him more isolated. Bill Willard, a longtime lawyer here, ventured a theory. He pointed out that Mr. Moore had never seemed to have any kind of social life, certainly not among his professional peers. And the current allegations, he said, could be seen in that context. \"He was really immature socially,\" Mr. Willard said of Mr. Moore’s reputed attraction to teenagers, \"and so it might kind of make sense.\" Having resigned his prosecutor job to run for judge and spent his savings to finance his failed bid, Mr. Moore left for Texas, to train as a kickboxer. It was a break from a trajectory that started with a working-class childhood in Gallant, a small rural community in the foothills east of Gadsden, where his father was a construction worker and his mother a homemaker. His path to adulthood was marked with blue-chip resume highlights, but also struggle and unpleasantness. In high school, Mr. Moore was elected student body president but is remembered by classmates as more hard-working than sociable. He fulfilled his dream of attending the United States Military Academy at West Point — people in Gadsden remember him showing up at an assembly at his old high school and walking around proudly in his cadet uniform. But he found the academy to be an intimidating place, peopled, he later wrote, by students who were more \"well read, traveled or experienced\" than he was and who considered him \"an easy target.\" It was at West Point, he wrote, that he found the boxing ring to be an equalizer, \"where someone from Alabama with a ‘country’ accent could get as much respect as anybody else.\" He graduated in the bottom quarter of his class. In Vietnam, where Mr. Moore commanded a military police battalion, he cracked down so aggressively on what he described as his troops’ drug use and lack of respect for authority that they derisively referred to him as Captain America. He was so convinced, he wrote, that one soldier was going to kill him that he put sandbags under the bed, ostensibly to keep grenades from being rolled under it. Law school, at the University of Alabama, was a \"welcome relief,\" he said. But in a recent newspaper column, Guy V. Martin Jr., one of Mr. Moore’s professors, described him as immersed in \"illogic,\" and said he had constantly argued with classmates. \"Moore never won one argument, and the debates got ugly and personal,\" Mr. Martin wrote. One afternoon in 1984, U. W. Clemon, a federal district court judge, was having lunch in his Gadsden office when Mr. Moore stopped by. He had returned after more than a year of boxing in Texas and working on a cattle ranch in the Australian outback. Judge Clemon, the first black federal judge in Alabama history, remembered Mr. Moore from several years earlier, when, as a prosecutor, Mr. Moore had urged opposition to his confirmation to the bench, charging that Judge Clemon was soft on crime. \"He said he was sorry that he had done it, it was wrong and he had heard good things about me,\" Judge Clemon remembered of that afternoon. Mr. Moore was not finished, though. He was opening a law office, he said, and he knew the judge had old law clients in Gadsden. He needed referrals. So began Mr. Moore’s second run at a legal career here, this time as a private practice attorney, working out of a room he rented from Mr. Allenstein in an 1897 Victorian manse, converted into an office building, near the courthouse. Mr. Allenstein remembered him as \"a great orator\" who was particularly gifted at closing arguments. \"He’d always say, ‘Myron you take care of the law, just get me to the jury,\" Mr. Allenstein said. \"Because he was a great talker.\" Kathleen Warren, a lawyer who shared the office space, has different memories. \"He seemed to not think much of women as a whole,\" she said. \"A true sexist.\" She had heard the gossip about him and young women, but the talk faded around the time of his marriage. At a Christmas gathering in 1984, as he describes in his book, he met a 23-year-old woman named Kayla Kisor, 14 years his junior, whom he immediately recognized from a dance recital he had attended \"many years before.\" They married the next year. As he settled in to raise a family and practice law, Mr. Moore remained combative, but few remember him as explicitly religious, though they concede he may have been at home. \"I think this, the whole religious thing, just came as an evolution of his political career,\" said Mr. Garmon, the former Gadsden Times reporter, a Democrat who said he liked Mr. Moore but abhorred his politics. In 1992, Mr. Moore finally became a circuit court judge. He was appointed by the governor at the time, Guy Hunt, to whom he had a connection through a family friend, after the sitting judge died of a heart attack. To decorate his courtroom, Mr. Moore put up a homemade redwood plaque of the Ten Commandments — a precursor to the granite behemoth he would later install in the state judicial building. Few seemed bothered, at first. But the next year, lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union took notice and threatened to sue. And \"by the time the election came around,\" Mr. Garmon said, referring to Mr. Moore’s re-election bid, \"everyone in the county knew about Roy and the Ten Commandments.\" Large rallies of support took place on the courthouse steps, and lawyers recall how Mr. Moore carefully gathered all his press clippings, laminated in giant scrapbooks. A fellow judge, William H. Rhea, remembered seeing envelopes around Mr. Moore’s office: \"People were sending him money from all around the country. You know, like $5 and $10.\" Gadsden watched him become a hero of the religious right with mixed feelings. \"I don’t want to use the word disgust,\" said Kathleen Sisson, 67, a retired educator who had known for years about Ms. Corfman’s account of Mr. Moore. \"But it bothered me greatly to know what I knew.\" Mr. Moore would go on to win legal fights and lose them, win elections and be removed from office only to win again, and eventually win the Republican nomination for United States Senate. \"I don’t frankly understand how it all came out, and I was there for every day of it,\" Judge Rhea said of Mr. Moore’s ascent to national prominence. \"It was just something that took off. I don’t know how else to describe it.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/us/roy-moore-alabama.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Star on Washington’s Ice With a No. 1 Fan at the Kremlin', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — The son of Moscow makes his living in Washington, cheered nightly by locals who think little of his country. He has, for a dozen years now, insinuated himself into the city, becoming its most cherished Russian import — digging out of snowstorms that reminded him of home, holding court at Russia House, the vodka-soaked lounge where he once lost a tooth. Most important, he became one of the most accomplished hockey players in the United States in a generation, scoring goals for the city’s championship-starved Washington Capitals. \"My second home,\" the star player, Alexander Ovechkin, said of the city. But about that first home. In a political season of investigations into Moscow’s interference in the 2016 election and the ever-invisible hand of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Ovechkin — a LeBron James-style prodigy with three M.V.P. awards, impish charisma and a gaptoothed grin — has glided into the zeitgeist with his own Washington mystery: He is the stickhandling hero who may or may not be a witting font of Kremlin propaganda in the United States’ capital. \"It’s all about country,\" Mr. Ovechkin said in an interview, semicryptically, from across a conference room table at the team’s practice facility in Arlington, Va. \"I just want to do my best for my country.\" This month, Mr. Ovechkin announced the creation of a \"civic movement\" he has called \"#putinteam,\" a demonstration of support for Mr. Putin, his most powerful admirer, months before the country’s election next year. (The two are close enough that Mr. Putin called Mr. Ovechkin at his wedding reception last summer, and gifted him a premium tea set.) \"Let’s come together,\" Mr. Ovechkin wrote, in Russian, in an Instagram post publicizing the new group, attaching a photograph of the two embracing in lily-white shirts, \"and show the world a strong and united Russia!\" Mr. Ovechkin, 32, insists the idea was his, unconnected to the Russian leader or his allies. \"Putin’s Team is Putin’s Team,\" Mr. Ovechkin said, in his first extended interview on the subject. \"It is just for people who support the country, and basically it’s a simple thing.\" But experts in Russian politics, where star athletes are often deployed for popular cover, are exceedingly skeptical. News reports in Russia have linked the campaign to a major public relations firm, which is said to have devised \"Putin Team\" before securing the blessing of the president’s orbit. (The firm has denied this.) And while Mr. Putin’s electoral prospects are hardly in doubt, the backing of prominent athletes is viewed as helpful in projecting mass popularity at home and abroad. American officials say they believe Mr. Ovechkin is most likely being used for precisely this sort of hearts-and-minds campaign aimed at garnering good will for Mr. Putin, whether or not Mr. Ovechkin is particularly conscious of this. The matter is not the highest of priorities for intelligence and law enforcement officials, who both laughed when first asked about \"Putin Team.\" Mr. Ovechkin is too recognizable, one official noted, to effectively traffic in proper espionage. The Kremlin itself has cheered Mr. Ovechkin’s decision conspicuously, reminding the public that he is \"a very famous Russian, a successful Russian.\" \"We know that he holds our president in high regard,\" Mr. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters this month. Evgeny Minchenko, a top political consultant in Russia with close Kremlin connections, said the group could help combat \"a mythology that Putin is in fact not popular and that his rating is inflated.\" Mr. Minchenko added that the support of figures like Mr. Ovechkin could coax \"apolitical youth\" to the polls. But the \"Putin Team\" effort has added a James-Bond-level plot flourish to a political moment teeming with them: a local celebrity — subsisting in an era when once-outlandish notions of Russian dark arts have proved credible — making good on his status as the American resident Mr. Putin might well value most, excepting the one in the White House. \"Russia spy or something?\" Mr. Ovechkin asked, when reminded of an ESPN commercial years ago in which he was playfully cast as a foreign agent. Well? He smiled and said nothing. For American fans, Mr. Ovechkin’s embrace of Mr. Putin has already proved uncomfortable, forcing some to reconcile their idol’s support for a government seen as hostile to national interests with Mr. Ovechkin’s image as an affable regional man-child. He has played Whac-a-Mole at an amusement park in Maryland in his \"Russian Army\" T-shirt, tailgated at a Redskins game and dressed as a prison inmate at a Halloween party at Mari Vanna, a restaurant in downtown Washington. In his younger days, he was known to appoint himself both D.J. and bartender behind the counter at Russia House on Connecticut Avenue, where occasionally he left a piece of himself on the premises. \"He came in with all his teeth,\" began one story from Aaron McGovern, an owner of the lounge, recalling a particularly rowdy evening. Mr. Ovechkin, he said, had popped out a filler tooth and left it in a white hooded sweatshirt that was later stolen. As a rookie in 2005, knowing little English, Mr. Ovechkin greeted Capitals staff members, one by one, with a single phrase he had memorized and only vaguely understood: \"Hi, I’m Alex. I’m so happy. Hi, I’m Alex. I’m so happy.\" Now, as one of the best players in the world, Mr. Ovechkin is a nontrivial piece of Washington’s economy: The Capitals said that ticket revenues had increased 167 percent over the past decade, as Mr. Ovechkin tugged the team to greater success. The franchise’s value has roughly quadrupled in the same period, according to Forbes. Inside the Capitals arena, his No. 8 jersey fills the stands. \"If he could beat the Penguins, I’d give him a pretty long leash,\" said George Schick, an Ovechkin fan and Putin critic, wearing the player’s uniform during a recent game. He paused for a moment. \"Crushing the dissidents in Russia is pretty not cool,\" Mr. Schick allowed. For years, Mr. Ovechkin, known as Ovi in Washington and Sasha in Moscow, has appeared alongside Mr. Putin in a series of Kremlin-promoted scenes of alpha bonding. They have skated together in an exhibition game against student players and have taken in a tournament of the martial art sambo, developed in the 1920s to improve the hand-to-hand combat skills of the Red Army. The men share a zeal for shirtlessness — the president on horseback, the player on the dance floor at his own wedding reception — and a thirst for expressive celebration. After teammates poured champagne into a world championship trophy in 2014, it was Mr. Ovechkin who stepped in to lift the cup high enough for Mr. Putin to drink from it. In June, Mr. Ovechkin appeared in the audience for the president’s call-in show, his presence enshrined with a photograph on the Kremlin website. In July, he acquired the matrimonial tea set from Mr. Putin, which he said he had not yet found the time to use. The president’s bond with Mr. Ovechkin has not been lost on less famous Russian hockey players. \"He never called me like Ovi,\" Evgeni Malkin, a standout for the Pittsburgh Penguins, said of Mr. Putin this month after a loss to Mr. Ovechkin’s Capitals. \"He’s too busy to call to me.\" Friends have described Mr. Ovechkin as a politically oblivious figure with uncomplicated tastes and ambitions, gravitating toward borscht, video games and a meticulous training regimen. He could not be bothered, they suggested, with geopolitical scheming. \"He’s still a big kid,\" said Pete Kalamoutsos, a club owner who has known Mr. Ovechkin since his rookie season. In the interview, Mr. Ovechkin made a version of this argument himself. Hockey players, he said, have little instinct for politics. \"We’re not that smart,\" he said. \"We just stay away from that and just do our job.\" He also suggested that his contact with Mr. Putin should not be overstated, estimating that they had not spoken since the summer and clarifying that he did not have a cellphone number for the president. \"It would be nice, though,\" he added. Of course, staying in Mr. Putin’s good graces has its advantages in Russia, where retired athletes have often assumed postcareer roles in his extended circle. For Mr. Putin — whose country hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and has been ensnared recently in a state-sponsored doping scandal — sports have been emphasized as an expression of patriotism and national greatness. Though many hockey players living in the United States have boosted Mr. Putin through the years, Mr. Ovechkin’s dedication has been particularly notable. He courted criticism in 2014 after an Instagram post that appeared to express support for Mr. Putin’s actions in Ukraine, though Mr. Ovechkin again said then that he was not trying to make a political statement. Such explanations, fans said, have become more difficult to accept. \"I think a lot of people tried to kind of compartmentalize it and focus on the hockey part of Ovi,\" said Ian Oland, a founder of a website, RMNB, that intimately covers the Capitals. \"It was kind of something you could overlook.\" Mr. Oland’s site takes its name from a quotation uttered by Mr. Ovechkin in 2006, after his rapid recovery from an injury: \"Russian machine never breaks.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/us/politics/alexander-ovechkin-capitals-putin.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'When Unpaid Student Loan Bills Mean You Can No Longer Work', 'text': ' Fall behind on your student loan payments, lose your job. Few people realize that the loans they take out to pay for their education could eventually derail their careers. But in 19 states, government agencies can seize state-issued professional licenses from residents who default on their educational debts. Another state, South Dakota, suspends driver’s licenses, making it nearly impossible for people to get to work. As debt levels rise, creditors are taking increasingly tough actions to chase people who fall behind on student loans. Going after professional licenses stands out as especially punitive. Firefighters, nurses, teachers, lawyers, massage therapists, barbers, psychologists and real estate brokers have all had their credentials suspended or revoked. Determining the number of people who have lost their licenses is impossible because many state agencies and licensing boards don’t track the information. Public records requests by The New York Times identified at least 8,700 cases in which licenses were taken away or put at risk of suspension in recent years, although that tally almost certainly understates the true number. Shannon Otto, who lives in Nashville, can pinpoint the moment that she realized she wanted to be a nurse. She was 16, shadowing her aunt who worked in an emergency room. She gaped as a doctor used a hand crank to drill a hole into a patient’s skull. She wanted to be part of the action. It took years of school and thousands of dollars of loans, but she eventually landed her dream job, in Tennessee, a state facing a shortage of nurses. Then, after working for more than a decade, she started having epileptic seizures. They arrived without warning, in terrifying gusts. She couldn’t care for herself, let alone anyone else. Unable to work, she defaulted on her student loans. Ms. Otto eventually got her seizures under control, and prepared to go back to work and resume payments on her debt. But Tennessee’s Board of Nursing suspended her license after she defaulted. To get the license back, she said, she would have to pay more than $1,500. She couldn’t. \"I absolutely loved my job, and it seems unbelievable that I can’t do it anymore,\" Ms. Otto said. With student debt levels soaring — the loans are now the largest source of household debt outside of mortgages — so are defaults. Lenders have always pursued delinquent borrowers: by filing lawsuits, garnishing their wages, putting liens on their property and seizing tax refunds. Blocking licenses is a more aggressive weapon, and states are using it on behalf of themselves and the federal government. Proponents of the little-known state licensing laws say they are in taxpayers’ interest. Many student loans are backed by guarantees by the state or federal government, which foot the bills if borrowers default. Faced with losing their licenses, the reasoning goes, debtors will find the money. But critics from both parties say the laws shove some borrowers off a financial cliff. Tennessee is one of the most aggressive states at revoking licenses, the records show. From 2012 to 2017, officials reported more than 5,400 people to professional licensing agencies. Many — nobody knows how many — lost their licenses. Some, like Ms. Otto, lost their careers. \"It’s an attention-getter,\" said Peter Abernathy, chief aid and compliance officer for the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation, a state-run commission that is responsible for enforcing the law. \"They made a promise to the federal government that they would repay these funds. This is the last resort to get them back into payment.\" In Louisiana, the nursing board notified 87 nurses last year that their student loans were in default and that their licenses would not be renewed until they became current on their payments. Eighty-four paid their debts. The three who did not are now unable to work in the field, according to a report published by the nursing board. \"It’s like shooting yourself in the foot, to take away the only way for these people to get back on track,\" said Daniel Zolnikov, a Republican state representative in Montana. People who don’t pay their loans back are punished \"with credit scores dropping, being traced by collection agencies, just having liens,\" he said. \"The free market has a solution to this already. What is the state doing with this hammer?\" In 2015, Mr. Zolnikov co-sponsored a bill with Representative Moffie Funk, a Democrat, that stopped Montana from revoking licenses for people with unpaid student debt — a rare instance of bipartisanship. The government’s interest in compelling student borrowers to pay back their debts has its roots in a policy adopted more than 50 years ago. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Higher Education Act, which created financial aid programs for college-bound students. To entice banks to make student loans, the government offered them insurance: If a borrower defaulted, it would step in and pick up the tab. The federal government relied on a network of state agencies to administer the program and pursue delinquent borrowers. (Since 2010, the federal government has directly funded all student loans, instead of relying on banks.) By the late 1980s, the government’s losses climbed past $1 billion a year, and state agencies started experimenting with aggressive collection tactics. Some states garnished wages. Others put liens on borrowers’ cars and houses. Texas and Illinois stopped renewing professional licenses of those with unresolved debts. The federal Department of Education urged other states to act similarly. \"Deny professional licenses to defaulters until they take steps to repayment,\" the department urged in 1990. Two years ago, South Dakota ordered officials to withhold various licenses from people who owe the state money. Nearly 1,000 residents are barred from holding driver’s licenses because of debts owed to state universities, and 1,500 people are prohibited from getting hunting, fishing and camping permits. \"It’s been quite successful,\" said Nathan Sanderson, the director of policy and operations for Gov. Dennis Daugaard. The state’s debt collection center — which pursues various debts, including overdue taxes and fines — has brought in $3.3 million since it opened last year. Much of that has flowed back to strapped towns and counties. But Jeff Barth, a commissioner in South Dakota’s Minnehaha County, said that the laws were shortsighted and that it was \"better to have people gainfully employed.\" In a state with little public transit, people who lose their driver’s licenses often can’t get to work. \"I don’t like people skipping out on their debts,\" Mr. Barth said, \"but the state is taking a pound of flesh.\" Mr. Sanderson countered that people did not have to pay off their debt to regain their licenses — entering into a payment plan was enough. But those payment plans can be beyond some borrowers’ means. Tabitha McArdle earned $48,000 when she started out as a teacher in Houston. A single mother, she couldn’t keep up with her monthly $800 student loan payments. In March, the Texas Education Agency put her on a list of 390 teachers whose certifications cannot be renewed until they make steady payments. She now has no license. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, who has worked to overturn these laws, called them \"tantamount to modern-day debtors’ prison.\" States differ in their rules and enforcement mechanisms. Some, like Tennessee, carefully track how many borrowers are affected, but others do not keep even informal tallies. In Kentucky, the Higher Education Assistance Authority is responsible for notifying licensing boards when borrowers default. The agency has no master list of how many people it has reported, according to Melissa F. Justice, a lawyer for the agency. But when the agency sends out default notifications, licensing boards take action. A public records request to the state’s nursing board revealed that the licenses of at least 308 nurses in Kentucky had been revoked or flagged for review. In some states, the laws are unused. Hawaii has a broad statute, enacted in 2002, that allows it to suspend vocational licenses if the borrower defaults on a student loan. But the state’s licensing board has never done so, said William Nhieu, a spokesman for Hawaii’s Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, because no state or federal student loan agencies have given it the names of delinquent borrowers. Officials from Alaska, Iowa, Massachusetts and Washington also said their laws were not being used. Oklahoma and New Jersey eliminated or defanged their laws last year, with bipartisan support. But in places where the laws remain active, they haunt people struggling to pay back loans. Debra Curry, a nurse in Georgia, fell behind on her student loan payments when she took a decade off from work to raise her six children. In 2015, after two years back on the job, she received a letter saying that her nursing license would be suspended unless she contacted the state to set up a payment plan. Ms. Curry, 58, responded to the notice immediately, but state officials terminated her license anyway — a mistake, she was told. It took a week to get it reinstated. \"It was traumatic,\" Ms. Curry said. She now pays about $1,500 each month to her creditors, nearly half her paycheck. She said she worried that her debt would again threaten her ability to work. \"I really do want to pay the loans back,\" she said. \"How do you think I’m going to be able to pay it back if I don’t have a job?\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/business/student-loans-licenses.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '', 'text': '', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/18/world/australia/manus-island-australia-detainees.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'In Rio de Janeiro, ‘Complete Vulnerability’ as Violence Surges', 'text': ' RIO DE JANEIRO — For teachers in this seaside megacity, Rio de Janeiro’s surge in violence has meant making a life-or-death judgment call with unnerving frequency: deciding whether to cancel classes because of nearby shootouts. For police officers, it has meant burying 119 of their own so far this year and surrendering ever more territory to drug gangs that have resumed open-air sales in teeming communities that had been declared \"pacified\" just a few years ago. Many ordinary residents of this city of about 6.5 million start the day scanning mobile apps that track live reports of gunfire before planning their commutes. A little more than a year since Rio de Janeiro hosted a largely successful Summer Olympics, Brazil’s showcase city is plagued by a rise in lawlessness reminiscent of its darkest periods in the 1980s and 1990s. There were 4,974 people killed in Rio de Janeiro State, with a population of about 16.5 million, during the first nine months of this year, up 11 percent from last year, according to state government statistics. The rise in violent crime here is part of a nationwide trend that experts say has been exacerbated by Brazil’s economic recession, by corruption that has hollowed out government coffers and by fierce competition among drug trafficking organizations. Last year, there were 61,619 people killed across Brazil, according to data compiled by Brazilian Forum on Public Security, making it the deadliest year on record. Facing a budget deficit and increasingly well-armed and organized drug cartels, officials in Rio de Janeiro have turned to the federal government for a bailout and to the military for backup. \"The situation is one of complete vulnerability,\" said Antônio Carlos Costa, the head of Rio de Paz, an organization that supports victims of violence. \"The weapons used by the traffickers are weapons of war.\" The resurgence of violence comes after what had been tangible, but short-lived gains in reducing the city’s crime. In 2008, when Brazil was preparing to host the 2014 World Cup, and was bidding for the 2016 Olympics, government officials launched an ambitious plan to secure the city’s favelas, a patchwork of unplanned hillside communities that had long been neglected by the government. A system of community policing was established and law enforcement officers were rewarded when they met crime reduction targets. It amounted to a counterinsurgency strategy. So-called Pacification Police Units established in the favelas were envisioned as the first step to bringing state services to the areas. A steady police presence was supposed to root out the organized crime networks that had become the de facto authority in the favelas, and then the plan called for gradually expanding access to decent sanitation, health care and education to the historically marginalized communities. For a few years, the plan appeared to get traction. From a peak of 65 violent deaths per 100,000 Rio de Janeiro State residents in 1994, the rate dropped to 29 in 2012. A $10.7 billion investment in infrastructure before the 2016 Games brought hope that the Olympics would serve as a catalyst to reduce inequality in a city where exorbitant wealth and destitution had long coexisted in stark contrast. The main reason that didn’t happen can be summed up in one word, according to Monica de Bolle, an expert on Brazil at the Peterson Institute for International Economics: Corruption. \"To the extent that you were reclaiming territories of the favelas from drug traffickers, you needed to create jobs,\" Ms. de Bolle added. \"There was an expectation that there was going to be a massive investment in social projects in the favelas, and then the money ran out completely.\" The state-run oil giant Petrobras, based in Rio de Janeiro and one of the city’s economic engines, was crippled by the disclosure of an enormous kickback scheme in 2014. That scandal unfolded as the global price of oil fell precipitously. Simultaneously, according to federal prosecutors, state officials, including the former state governor Sérgio Cabral, turned  spending on the Olympics into an exercise in fraud that allowed senior government officials and businessmen to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars from the public treasury. While the Olympics led to durable gains for Rio de Janeiro — most notably by upgrading its public transportation system — missed opportunities are evident in virtually every part of the city. The C.E. Clóvis Monteiro high school in Jacarezinho, in northern Rio de Janeiro, bears a \"Rio 2016\" plaque with the Olympic logo that says \"Education transforms.\" But ask the principal, Andreia Queiroz, about the area’s recent transformation, and you get a tour of bullet holes in her building, including one that shattered a classroom window. This year, Ms. Queiroz has often started her morning before dawn scanning reports about gun battles, relying on a series of group chats she monitors on WhatsApp. Deciding when to shut down the school is more art than science, a grim ritual she and other educators across the city have become accustomed to. Through late October, there had been only 11 days this year in which at least one school in the city was not shut down as a result of violence, according to Rio de Janeiro’s municipal education system. That has meant that more than 161,000 students have had their studies interrupted by clashes. Ms. Queiroz said the breakdown of security and the economic downturn had led as many as 400 of the 1,500 students enrolled in her school to stop coming to class regularly this year. \"Here we have some students providing for their families,\" she said. The ones who continue to come are often jumpy, she added. \"I see their difficulty in concentrating,\" she added. \"They are here, but their head is always outside.\" A scan of the school’s walls reveals hints of the violence raging outside — and the manner in which it is shaping national politics. The letters CV — the acronym of Comando Vermelho, or Red Command — and the words \"Fora Bolsonaro,\" or Be Gone, Bolsonaro, are scrawled all over the walls. The first is a sign of allegiance to the powerful gang that has been the de facto authority in several pockets of Rio de Janeiro for decades. The second is a repudiation of a far-right congressman, Jair Bolsonaro — currently polling second in next year’s presidential contest — who has vowed to empower security forces to kill more of what he calls \"bandits.\" The front lines for the type of crackdown Mr. Bolsonaro has promised are forming in the neighborhood outside the school. On a recent afternoon, young men armed with rifles stood at the entry points of a sector of Jacarezinho controlled by drug traffickers. Schoolchildren walked home zigzagging through clogged, narrow streets, where produce stands share sidewalk space with tables where sellers hawked small bags of cocaine and marijuana. Several walls in the community are spattered with deep holes from blasts of ammunition sprayed by machine guns. \"We’re in the crossfire,\" said Maria, a 63-year-old woman who does nails at a tiny salon with bare light bulbs and declined to provide her last name because of security concerns. \"I’ve lost lots of business.\" A poll conducted by the research firm Datafolha in early October found that 72 percent of Rio de Janeiro residents would move to a safer city if they could. The survey, which included 812 respondents and had a four percentage point margin of error, found that fewer than one in 10 people felt the military police, the main entity responsible for security, were efficient at preventing crime. Ordinary residents here speak with similar despondence about the police and the drug gangs. Ana Paula Oliveira, a community activist whose 19-year-old son was killed by the police in 2014, said residents of low-income communities feel besieged every time the police crack down temporarily, only to ultimately fade away and allow areas to fall back under the control of traffickers. Between January and September, at least 800 of the people killed in the state were shot by police officers. \"They come to us with a discourse that there is a war,\" she said. \"But this is not a war. It’s a massacre of poor people living in favelas. In order to ensure that the elite enjoys security, it’s necessary to kill the poor people.\" Upscale parts of Rio de Janeiro, including the tourist hubs like Copacabana and Ipanema, feel like a world apart, thanks to a robust police presence. But they have not been spared by the rise in crime. And the violence has taken a steep toll on the tourism industry. The city lost approximately $200 million in tourism revenue between January and August, according to the National Federation of Commerce, Goods, Services and Tourism. Two tourists have been shot so far this year in the city, including a Spanish woman who was killed by a policeman last month while she was touring a favela. While security in Brazil has historically been a state and municipal government responsibility, the federal government in recent months has deployed hundreds of soldiers to contain outbursts of violence in Rio de Janeiro. In a sign that the military is bracing for a prolonged role here, it successfully lobbied Congress last month to pass a law allowing soldiers who commit crimes against civilians during operations to be tried in military tribunals, rather than civilian courts. Roberto Sá, the secretary of security for Rio de Janeiro State, said in response to emailed questions that the \"financial calamity\" that had afflicted the state over the last year and a half had made it impossible to implement a comprehensive security policy. \"To put it in practice,\" Mr. Sá said, \"we need financial resources that the state does not have at its disposal.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/world/americas/rio-de-janeiro-brazil-violent-crime-security.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Hedge Fund Manager Committed Fraud. Would the U.S. Let Him Go?', 'text': ' TORONTO — Forty inmates lined up for the daily mail call at the Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution, a complex of low-slung brick buildings in the middle of New Jersey. It was July 2012, and one of the inmates was Philip Baker. A former hedge fund manager, he was serving a 20-year sentence for fraud. He had used bogus performance data to lure hundreds of people and institutions into his fund. His investors had lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Baker, 46 at the time, admitted that he had committed fraud. \"I’m a criminal,\" he said recently. But he had convinced himself that he deserved to be free. And he was waiting for a letter that might turn his fantasy into reality. Months earlier, Mr. Baker, who is Canadian, had signed a plea agreement that included an unusual caveat: Prosecutors would not object to the Justice Department’s transferring him to Canada to serve out his sentence. Such transfers were rare. But Mr. Baker knew that if he could persuade the Justice Department to give him one, Canada would probably parole him after he had served only a fraction of his prison term. Mr. Baker, a Baptist, prayed for God’s guidance. \"Only he could set my direction straight,\" he said during one in a series of interviews about his life and crimes. In the prison’s television room, a guard dispensing the mail called out inmates’ names and numbers. \"Philip Baker, 22856-424.\" Mr. Baker stepped forward. The guard handed him a thin envelope with a Justice Department return address. Assuming it was more paperwork, he tore it open — and could not believe what he saw. He started to tremble. He felt people staring at him. \"I felt like throwing up,\" he said. After the financial crisis last decade, the federal government was expected to aggressively pursue criminal cases against top financiers: the fund managers, bankers, mortgage lenders and Wall Street executives who helped cause the global economy to crater. But prosecutions have been rare. The exceptions have been obscure or relatively junior industry players against whom it was easy to build cases but who did not bear primary responsibility for the crisis. One reason: Prosecutors were under pressure to move quickly and to not lose trials. They preferred to take the safest, simplest routes to win convictions, and to then move on to new cases. That is what happened with Mr. Baker, who became a top target. The government labeled him a fugitive, made him the subject of an international manhunt and, eventually, extradited him from Germany, where he had been living with his wife. Mr. Baker was not a big fish; his hedge fund had under $1 billion in assets. And even when he was apprehended, a desire to resolve the case swiftly led a powerful United States attorney to insert the transfer-to-Canada clause into an otherwise airtight plea agreement. His experience highlights one of the primary critiques of the Obama administration’s efforts to clean up Wall Street: Bankers nearly destroyed the global economy, but few went to jail. This account of Mr. Baker’s long-shot effort to escape to Canada, which has not previously been reported, is based on interviews with him and his family, and with his lawyers, former colleagues and current and former government officials, as well as on thousands of pages of legal documents, internal emails and other records from Mr. Baker’s defunct hedge fund. Philip Baker was raised in a middle-class family in Toronto. One of his earliest memories took place in the hospital. Born with a heart defect, he needed surgery when he was 7. When it was time for the procedure, his parents walked out of his hospital room. \"I thought they were abandoning me,\" he said. That fear stayed with him, fostering a desire to please his parents and other authority figures. As a boy, he showed an affinity for finance. While his friends played with toy soldiers, he toted a leather briefcase and pretended to be a stockbroker. But his early years in the financial industry were rocky. After dropping out of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., he eventually landed at the brokerage Refco. Colleagues remember an insecure man whose nickname was \"Philipbuster,\" because of his tendency to talk endlessly. He married a woman from a wealthy Canadian family, heirs to the Hollinger media fortune. The couple had five children in Windsor, Ontario. \"I was always trying to impress that family,\" Mr. Baker said. Hoping to prove that he could succeed as an entrepreneur, he quit Refco to start his own hedge fund. The fund failed. Mr. Baker lied to his wife and in-laws that he had found a new job at a big Detroit bank. For several months, he put on a suit and pretended to cross the Detroit River and go to work. One day, he said, his wife tried to call him at the office. The bank told her that nobody named Philip Baker worked there. Mr. Baker recalls her words to him that evening, when he came home: \"Get out.\" The marriage was over. (She declined to be interviewed.) He holed up in a friend’s basement. One morning, he grabbed a .22-caliber rifle and drove to a forest outside town. He called a former Refco colleague, John Kurgan, and said he was preparing to kill himself. \"Slow down a minute, cowboy,\" Mr. Kurgan responded. He told Mr. Baker he had a job prospect for him in Toronto. Then, noting that Mr. Baker had called in on a recorded Refco line, Mr. Kurgan jokingly asked if he could sell the audio of his suicide. Mr. Baker was infuriated by the comment. But it snapped him out of his suicidal stupor. What happened next set the stage for Mr. Baker’s later downfall. According to Mr. Baker and to his plea agreement, he and Mr. Kurgan went into business together. They formed a new commodities-trading hedge fund, Lake Shore Asset Management. Mr. Baker lined up clients, and Mr. Kurgan did much of the trading. Mr. Kurgan was not charged with wrongdoing. In an interview, he declined to describe his role in the business. \"This is something that happened many years ago,\" he said. Mr. Baker set up shop in another basement — this one in his parents’ home, north of Toronto. He raised more than $10 million for the fund. A tiny sum in hedge-fund terms, but enough that Lake Shore was able to start trading in February 2002. The fund got off to a spectacularly bad start. That summer, a single futures trade lost 48 percent of the fund’s assets. Mr. Baker blamed Mr. Kurgan for the bad trade. To hide the loss, Lake Shore concocted data that showed a stellar performance. Mr. Baker shared the bogus numbers with current and prospective clients. One marketing brochure cited annual returns of more than 30 percent. Another claimed falsely that the firm had a 14-year investing record. Mr. Kurgan, now working at Royal Bank of Canada, accused Mr. Baker of \"trying to muddy my name\" and noted that \"the justice system obviously found him guilty.\" Mr. Kurgan did not respond to detailed follow-up questions sent to him by email. Mr. Baker knew he was committing fraud. \"I failed to stand up for my clients,\" he said, adding that he did not want to betray Mr. Kurgan, whom he credited with preventing his suicide. \"I became too loyal.\" The firm attracted hundreds of new clients. Royal Bank of Canada invested millions of dollars, as did EquiGenesis, a Toronto money manager specializing in tax-efficient investing and charitable giving. Lake Shore \"created an impression of credibility,\" said Kenneth M. Gordon, EquiGenesis’s president. Lake Shore’s staff grew to more than a dozen traders and salespeople. It opened offices in London and Geneva. Prominent finance executives, including Laurence Rosenberg, the former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, joined the board. Mr. Baker bought bespoke suits. He hired a butler. At a club in Hamburg, Germany, one night, he met Kristina Malychenko, a tall blonde from Kazakhstan. They started dating. Mr. Baker was earning millions — more than $7 million in the first half of 2007 alone, he said. He felt like he was proving himself. \"I chased pride and vanity,\" he said. He described himself as being \"on the cusp of happiness.\" Lake Shore wanted to enter the American market. It set up a website aimed at investors in United States. That turned out to be a crucial mistake. A self-regulatory organization, the National Futures Association, started scrutinizing Lake Shore. The group alerted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to what appeared to be suspicious claims on the website. The commission concluded that Lake Shore had been soliciting American clients without legal authorization. Mr. Kurgan began to distance himself from the fund. He emailed Mr. Baker: \"If, through your kindness, you have listed me as either, director, partner or any other title with any of the Lake Shore entities please remove my name at once.\" As investigators dug in, they realized the fund had been lying about its history and performance. The problems deepened in August 2007, when the cash-management firm holding Lake Shore’s assets filed for bankruptcy. What little money the firm’s clients had left was now stuck in an insolvent firm. \"I felt like Napoleon being attacked by all sides,\" Mr. Baker said. Lake Shore shipped many of its files and computer hard drives to Geneva. Mr. Baker’s lawyer refused to hand over the materials to the Americans, citing Swiss bank-secrecy laws. \"We invested money in good faith based on representations they made, and then the money vanished,\" Mr. Gordon of EquiGenesis said. \"It was a disaster.\" The commodities trading commission filed civil fraud charges against Mr. Baker and Lake Shore. A federal judge, persuaded that Mr. Baker was on the run and hiding evidence, referred the case to the local United States attorney’s office for criminal investigation. F.B.I. agents interviewed Mr. Baker’s Lake Shore colleagues. Mr. Kurgan told them that he had no formal role with Lake Shore and was only its outside broker, an F.B.I. summary of the interview shows. By the F.B.I.’s tally, Lake Shore’s roughly 700 clients had lost more than $300 million. Investigators believed that Mr. Baker and others at the firm had siphoned off at least $11 million for their personal use. In February 2009, a grand jury returned a sealed, 27-count indictment accusing Mr. Baker of fraud, embezzlement and obstruction of justice. His colleagues were not charged. That month, Mr. Baker married Ms. Malychenko in a civil ceremony in Hamburg, where the two were living. He said he did not know that he had been indicted, or even that he was a wanted man. With Lake Shore dead, he said, he was trying to focus on the future. \"God had a different plan, and I moved on,\" he said. Investigators, though, were moving in. A few months later, in June 2009, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the United States attorney in Chicago, unsealed the criminal charges and described Mr. Baker as a \"fugitive.\" The Justice Department issued an international arrest warrant via Interpol. Within a few weeks — and just days after Mr. Baker and Ms. Malychenko celebrated their nuptials with a black-tie party at a Hamburg yacht club — a pair of plainclothes German police officers appeared at Mr. Baker’s door. They escorted him to their car. His new wife blew him a kiss. Mr. Baker was held in a prison near the Hamburg airport. One day, an official from the Canadian Embassy came to visit with a brochure explaining Mr. Baker’s rights as a Canadian citizen. One right he learned about: If he were convicted in the United States, he would be entitled under an international treaty to apply to be transferred to Canada to serve his sentence. \"That’s when I started thinking about how to pull this off,\" he said. In December 2009, after Mr. Baker had spent five months in a German jail, United States marshals flew him to Chicago, where he was booked into the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Months passed as he awaited a trial date, and Mr. Baker learned the prison’s rhythms. The most important thing, he said, was to convince other inmates that he was not a child molester. He told them he was a Wall Street crook. Prosecutors thought they had a clear-cut case against him. But in April 2010, the court-appointed receiver overseeing Lake Shore’s bankruptcy issued a report that said Mr. Kurgan was a part owner of Lake Shore and its affiliates and had played an official role at the companies. That clouded the prosecution narrative that Mr. Baker had acted on his own. Clifford C. Histed, the lead prosecutor on the case, summoned Mr. Baker to discuss the report. Mr. Baker argued that it proved he did not deserve to be punished alone. And he said the commodities trading commission was making Lake Shore a scapegoat, flexing its enforcement muscles after failing to prevent other hedge funds from blowing up. Mr. Histed told him to provide proof. Mr. Baker, using a computer in the prison library, spent months sifting through electronic documents before presenting his case to Mr. Histed. The prosecutor did not agree that Mr. Baker was the victim of a government conspiracy. But in Mr. Baker’s final plea agreement, prosecutors said Mr. Baker did have a partner, described as \"Individual A,\" who had misrepresented Lake Shore’s returns and misappropriated money. \"Individual A\" refers to Mr. Kurgan, according to a person involved in the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plea document. Mr. Baker and his lawyer, Daniel L. Rashbaum, a former prosecutor, were running out of legal options. Then Mr. Baker remembered the Canadian treaty he had learned about in Germany. Starting in the late 1970s, the United States had entered into a series of treaties that established protocols for cross-border prisoner transfers. One catalyst was the nonfiction book \"Midnight Express,\" the basis of a 1978 movie, about a young American imprisoned in Turkey. From 2005 to 2010, the Justice Department rejected 97 percent of all transfer applications, according to a 2011 government report. One reason was that federal prosecutors often opposed transfers on the grounds that prisoners did not serve their full sentences if transferred. That gave Mr. Rashbaum an idea. If he could get the United States attorney’s office to support a transfer to Canada, perhaps Justice Department officials in Washington would go along with it. And the Canadians, Mr. Rashbaum recalled thinking, were likely to let Mr. Baker out quickly. In that case, the length of his sentence in America wouldn’t matter. Mr. Rashbaum approached Mr. Histed with a proposal: Mr. Baker would admit guilt and accept a 20-year prison sentence, with no chance for parole, if the prosecutors did not object to him being transferred to Canada. Mr. Histed said in an interview that he knew the defense hoped the maneuver would result in Mr. Baker’s freedom, but he doubted it would work. And more important, he knew that going to trial would be time-consuming and risky for the government, in part because Mr. Baker could raise questions in front of a jury about why he alone was on trial. So Mr. Histed agreed to the deal. \"What mattered to us was that he be brought to justice in the United States,\" he said in an interview. On Aug. 24, 2011, Mr. Baker was presented a plea agreement to sign. He was nervous; his lawyer was terrified. \"The horror of pleading someone to 20 years based on a creative plan scared the living daylights out of me,\" Mr. Rashbaum said. Mr. Baker took a deep breath and signed the document. Mr. Rashbaum walked out to the parking lot and vomited. The government’s news release announcing Mr. Baker’s plea and sentence did not mention the possibility of a transfer to Canada. Neither did newspaper accounts. Before Mr. Baker left Chicago to begin serving his sentence, he received a bill from the Justice Department for $154,831,682.32 in restitution. \"We strongly urge you to pay this debt immediately,\" the bill said. He also received divorce papers from his wife. Mr. Baker filed his transfer application in April 2012. He knew it was a gamble. He had not paid any of his restitution, and Justice Department guidelines listed unpaid fines as a reason for rejecting such applications. On the other hand, the department had recently been criticized for being stingy in approving international transfers. Three months later, Mr. Baker stood in the mail-call line and opened the letter that would change his life. \"The United States has approved the request for transfer to Canada of the above-named Canadian national,\" it read. Mr. Baker felt dizzy. He scanned the letter again to make sure he had not misread it. Then he walked back to his cell. \"I think God really stepped in,\" he said. He had been imprisoned for about three years — five months in Germany, two years in Chicago and seven months at Fort Dix — after being convicted of a single count of fraud. As a result, he would probably be eligible for parole in Canada. Mr. Histed, the prosecutor, said the speed of the decision surprised him. \"If we knew he would immediately have been approved for a transfer, would that have changed our stance?\" he said. \"Perhaps.\" Mr. Baker’s transfer to Canada still needed the approval of the authorities there. Vic Toews, the minister for public safety at that time, believed that such transfers posed public-safety risks. He wrote that, because he had lived in Germany, Mr. Baker intended \"to abandon Canada as his place of permanent residence.\" The application was rejected. \"I always thought the hitch would be with the U.S. government, not the Canadians,\" Mr. Baker said. He had convinced himself that freedom was imminent. Now he was marooned in New Jersey. Coming to terms with the prospect of spending years in prison, he started to teach yoga. He dispensed investing advice to guards. He got a landscaping job on the prison grounds. His monthly pay was $18, a few dollars of which were earmarked to pay down his $155 million debt. And he began writing about his experience. Not knowing how his tale would end, he finished with a fictional scene in which he was reunited with his father on the shore of a lake where he had sailed as a boy. Then, after Mr. Baker had spent nearly six years incarcerated in America, Canada elected a new government, and Mr. Baker sensed an opportunity. Perhaps the new administration would have a more positive attitude about prisoner transfers. He reapplied. And this time, it worked. On May 10, 2016, another letter arrived, this one from Ottawa. Canada’s public safety minister, it said, \"has approved your transfer to Canada.\" Last fall, Mr. Baker rode a bus across the Canadian border to a minimum-security prison. He could cook for himself, and go fishing. Two months later, his case manager called him to ask: \"Do you want to go home?\" It was his mother’s birthday. The prison gave him a winter jacket and a bus ticket to Toronto. On the bus, Mr. Baker borrowed a passenger’s cellphone and called his father. \"I’m on a bus!\" he exclaimed. \"I started to cry,\" his father, William Baker, recalled. The elder Mr. Baker told his wife that he was taking her to dinner. The place, he said, was a surprise. Instead, he drove to a shopping mall northeast of Toronto. Their son was standing outside an Old Navy store. Mr. Baker’s release was not announced. His former colleagues, his first wife, the Lake Shore clients who lost money — no one knew he was out. \"I’m sorry he’s out of jail, because that’s where he belongs,\" said Mr. Rosenberg, the former Lake Shore director. \"He screwed so many people.\" Mr. Baker moved back into his parents’ basement. He set up a small office with some accouterments — a golden pen case, a picture of a yacht — from his Lake Shore days. He interviewed for a job as a financial consultant. He contemplated turning his prison writings into a book. That was when he discovered he had miscalculated. In prison, he had imagined that if he got to Canada, the authorities in the United States would not pursue him for the $155 million he owed. But this summer, a lawyer whom he had consulted about a book deal broke the news: The receiver in the Lake Shore bankruptcy could chase him and any money he made, through Canada’s civil courts. So Mr. Baker is free. But he has no prospect of escaping the shadow of his former life. \"I’m screwed,\" he said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/business/a-hedge-fund-manager-committed-fraud-would-the-us-let-him-go.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Trump Wants More Big Infrastructure Projects. The Obstacles Can Be Big, Too.', 'text': ' President Trump says he is frustrated with the slow pace of major construction projects like highways, ports and pipelines. Last summer, he pledged to use the power of the presidency to jump start building when it became bogged down in administrative delays. \"No longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay,\" Mr. Trump said in August. In an executive order, the president directed federal agencies to coordinate environmental impact reviews for major projects with the goal of completing them within two years. Such reviews can often take four years and, in some cases, even longer. Other presidents, including Barack Obama, have tried with mixed success to streamline the approvals for big infrastructure projects by pushing federal agencies to do environmental reviews faster. Frequently, delays are caused because multiple agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Army Corps of Engineers, weigh in on the scope of an environmental review or have to issue separate permits before work can begin. The centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s plan gives an office, the Council on Environmental Quality, within the White House, the authority to coordinate actions and direct how environmental reviews are performed. Much of the plan’s inspiration lies in a report, \"Two Years Not Ten Years,\" issued in 2015 by Common Good, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group. The report estimated that the typical six-year delay in starting large building projects costs the country $3.7 trillion in lost economic activity, more than twice the amount needed to address the most urgent infrastructure needs. Along with roadblocks to speedy federal approval, the report blamed delays on such factors as fear of litigation and overly broad environmental reviews on all levels of government. \"They have embraced some of the goals and core ideas\" in our report, said Philip K. Howard, who heads Common Good and is a lawyer at Covington & Burling in Manhattan. He had been a member of President Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum, which disbanded in August after Mr. Trump’s remarks about the racial violence in Charlottesville, Va. An analysis by the Congressional Research Service found that some of the claims in Common Good’s report, including the $3.7 trillion estimate, lacked a statistical basis, though the group had defended its work. Infrastructure experts say that a lack of public and private funding, rather than bureaucratic delays, is the principal reason infrastructure projects stall. (In its budget proposal, the Trump administration has issued a six-page fact sheet about infrastructure funding, including private investment.) Still, they agree that the permitting process can be improved and streamlined. In addition to federal reviews, states and local governments must also approve major proposals — frequently a fraught process — and residents and other interest groups often use the courts to block or delay construction. Several recent projects illustrate the pitfalls new proposals confront and the challenge Mr. Trump faces in breaking the logjams. Long-overdue maintenance this summer to the train tracks leading to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan came against the backdrop of a much more ambitious project that never happened. The plan, known as Access to the Region’s Core, or ARC, would have created a new tunnel underneath the Hudson River for New Jersey Transit trains. First unveiled during the 1990s, it was promoted as the nation’s biggest public transportation infrastructure project and was supposed to cost $9 billion, create thousands of construction jobs and was funded by the federal government, New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. After years of environmental reviews, drilling of the ARC tunnel was underway in 2009. But construction stopped for a reason that has doomed other projects — disagreements among the various governments. In this case, it was New Jersey. Gov. Chris Christie, who originally supported the tunnel, killed it in 2010 for what he cited were issues related to potential cost overruns. Today, nearly a decade and a thousand train delays later, the concept behind the ARC tunnel has re-emerged in a reconfigured form as the Gateway Program, a $20-billion design that also involves a new rail tunnel below the Hudson River and the rehabilitation of an existing one. It would be used by New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains. A small portion of tunnel drilling for ARC will be used in Gateway New York and New Jersey officials support the project, and the environmental review for it took only two years rather than the usual four, said John D. Porcari, the project’s interim executive director. If all goes as planned, the Gateway project is anticipated to be completed in 2026. But there is still one hang-up: The Trump administration has yet to climb onboard. The law generally does not allow the federal government to pre-empt permitting decisions made by state and local officials. So even before federal delays might come into play, some projects are dead — or close to it — on arrival. An exception, experts say, involves areas overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, which has jurisdiction over projects such as natural gas pipelines and electric power lines. FERC’s authority recently came into play during a dispute in New York State over a relatively small project: a proposed $38 million plan to build a 7.8-mile-long branch off an existing natural gas pipeline to connect it with a power plant near Middletown, N.Y. When the Millennium Pipeline Company announced the project in 2015, it drew opposition from communities opposed to hydraulic fracking, a controversial method of extracting natural gas that is banned in New York. State officials also jumped into the dispute, arguing in court that FERC had failed, among other things, to account for the environmental impacts of added greenhouse gas emissions from the power plant before approving the pipeline. But in June, a federal judge agreed with Millennium’s argument that state officials had failed to voice their objections in a timely fashion and referred the issue back to FERC, which has since issued a waiver to allow the company to proceed. State officials have asked FERC to review the case. The expected cost of the pipeline extension has since risen to $57 million based on actions that the company said it had taken to address the state’s concerns. Mr. Howard, the lawyer from Common Good, has argued that Congress should enact legislation that would give the federal government more authority to overrule state and local permitting reviews. No such proposal exists in Congress. Some projects that are big drivers of the economy do not involve federal approvals. Delays result from state and local decisions, and Mr. Trump — or any federal official for that matter — does not have the standing to intervene. A good illustration is the long-delayed effort by the BNSF Railway to build a new intermodal facility in Southern California. The facility would transfer cargo containers arriving on ships from Asia to freight trains headed east to cities such as Denver and Chicago. BNSF says it has invested about $50 million for such things as studies needed to comply with the permitting process. Currently, cargo containers arriving at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are picked up by tractor-trailers and driven to an existing BNSF site in downtown Los Angeles for transfer to trains. BNSF estimates show that it is a journey of 24 miles that 1,000 trucks make daily. In 2005, BNSF announced a proposal to build a transfer point just four miles from the ports that would reduce truck travel, highway congestion and air pollution, according to the company. In 2013, Los Angeles approved the company’s environmental impact report and issued a construction permit. But an environmental group and a local air quality district challenged that decision, citing the facility’s potential impact on nearby residential communities. In 2016, a California state judge upheld that challenge and ordered BNSF to expand its review to include a broader regional study assessing the facility’s environmental impact. The company has appealed that decision and expects a decision in coming months. Building of any sort has environmental consequences, and big building can have big consequences, making environmental objections a central factor in delaying federal projects. Such a case is playing out in Utah. A proposed highway, known as the Northern Corridor, is intended to ease future congestion around St. George, one of this country’s fastest-growing metropolitan areas. But the seven-mile-long highway also raises an environmental dilemma because a portion of it would run through federally owned land that is home to a protected species, the Mojave desert tortoise, which can live up to 50 years. The dispute over the highway has been underway for more than a decade. Local officials have argued that they could build the road without endangering the tortoises, and in 2009, a federal law directed the Bureau of Land Management to identify a possible route. But when the bureau released a plan last year, the agency was skeptical of the route favored by local officials because of its potential impact on sensitive habitat. Soon afterward, Representative Chris Stewart, a Republican of Utah, introduced legislation that would require federal agencies, including the bureau, to approve the route if it met all other permitting requirements. In July, the bill passed a House committee and may be taken up by the full House later this year or next. Farmers in southern Missouri, who experience severe flooding, have long supported a plan to close a quarter-mile gap in a large levee along the Mississippi River. And since 1975, the Army Corps of Engineers has offered a variety of ways to plug the levee. But that would also drain wetlands and potentially increase flooding elsewhere, causing officials with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to put on the brakes. In 2007, a federal judge blocked further development on the $161 million project, which is known as the St. Johns Bayou and New Madrid Floodway, finding that the Army Corps had failed to use sound science to examine its environmental impact. The agencies then said they would work together to resolve their differences. But by 2013 the gridlock remained so intense that Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, placed a temporary hold on Gina McCarthy’s nomination to head the E.P.A. in an effort to resolve the standstill. Last year, President Obama’s Council on Environmental Quality, the White House office, sided with the opponents. It held that efforts by the Army Corps to mitigate the project’s impacts, while extensive, were not enough. That, however, might not be the final word. The environmental council left the door open to resolution of concerns, and President Trump’s nominee to head the Army Corps, Rickey Dale James, owns a business in the area and has been a longtime supporter of the project.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/business/trump-wants-more-big-infrastructure-projects-the-obstacles-can-be-big-too.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Judge Ruchie, the Hasidic Superwoman of Night Court', 'text': ' Just before the Jewish High Holy Days this fall, Judge Rachel Freier was rushing around her kitchen, as she perpetually is. She had just cooked a salmon dish for Sabbath dinner. She was talking to her daughter in Israel on her headset. She was at a countertop, cutting apples and wrapping tuna salad sandwiches to take to work, because at night court in Brooklyn, where she presides, there’s little to eat that’s kosher. Stepping outside her townhouse in Borough Park, Brooklyn, she climbed into her purple and white minivan emblazoned with the emblems of the female volunteer emergency medical service she founded in her ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. A trained paramedic, she keeps her medical bags in her vehicle, just in case. \"My car is like my second home,\" she said. This is Ruchie Freier, as friends call her, a 52-year-old Hasidic Jewish grandmother who has blazed a trail in her insular religious community with so much determination that the male authorities have simply had to make room. Eleven years ago, she became one of the first Hasidic female lawyers in Brooklyn, and last November, she was elected as a judge to civil court, making her almost certainly the first female Hasidic elected official in the country. She has done so not by breaking the strict religious rules that govern ultra-Orthodox women’s lives, but by obeying them so scrupulously that there are limited grounds for objection. \"I conformed,\" she said in an interview in her spacious living room. \"I just found some creative ways to extend what it means to conform.\" Along with her official duties, she serves these days as a kind of diplomat between Hasidic Jews and the secular world, explaining the realities of the courts to the Hasidim and the habits of the Hasidim to the courts. And she has also been using her public platform to warn publicly of what she sees as a grave threat to her community’s survival, an epidemic of lost youth and suicides that is driven, she believes, by an unforgiving culture of judgment among ultra-Orthodox schools and families that she feels needs to change. Last summer, she wrote a column for Vos Iz Neias, an online Orthodox news source, about Malky Klein, a Hasidic girl who had been expelled from her yeshiva and died of a heroin overdose in June. She quoted anecdotal statistics that estimate 70 Orthodox Jewish children have died of drug overdoses or suicide in the past year. \"What happened in our community; why have so many of our children been cast away — thrown overboard into dangerous and troubled waters?\" she wrote. \"We need to unite and champion true Torah values to solve our problem.\" Most Hasidic women do not pursue high-profile success in the outside world. They are taught their most sacred role is to maintain the religious sanctity of their home and raise their children. \"What a woman does in order to enhance her glory is not put herself out as an example to other people in the public domain, but rather in private, in the home,\" said Samuel Heilman, a professor of sociology at City University of New York and an expert on the Orthodox and Hasidic communities. \"The men are in the forefront, they run the world, and we are the power behind the throne,\" said Pearl Engelman, 70, a great-grandmother in the Satmar Hasidic sect in Williamsburg, who broke that paradigm several years ago by speaking publicly about a cover-up of child sex-abuse cases in the ultra-Orthodox community. Women are generally permitted to work outside the home to support their families, so long as they comport with religious rules. And Judge Freier felt she could do all that was expected of her as a Hasidic woman — and be a judge, a paramedic and a voice for change, too. \"Everyone was waiting to see, ‘What is she going to do?\" Judge Freier said of the wary attitude toward her after she became a judge. \"And I’m the same. I dress the same, I still cook and I still bake and I do whatever I always did. Whatever we consider important traditional Hasidic values, I didn’t let go. So I guess it was an eye-opener for everyone.\" \"She is a good barometer of how this community is going through a transition,\" Mr. Heilman, the sociologist, said. \"It might seem glacially slow from the perspective of the outside world, but clearly she is a sign of the growing power of women, of the impact of democracy and an open society.\" A few minutes before her 5 p.m. shift on a recent evening, Justice Freier arrived at Brooklyn Criminal Court on Schermerhorn Street. She is only 5 feet tall, and slender. She was dressed formally, with a dark wig covering her hair to meet the modesty requirements of her sect, and a tailored business suit, its skirt reaching below her knees. It was a half-hour drive from her home but a universe away from Borough Park, where men with side curls and women pushing strollers speak Yiddish on the streets. Here there were police officers and court officers in bulletproof vests. In a narrow hallway, Judge Freier conferred briefly with another female judge about a case. She was ushered into an elevator used to transport prisoners, and strode to her chambers through a warren of hallways divided by metal fences. She will pray, as she does three times a day, before she takes the bench. Her rebbetzin, a female religious mentor such as the wife of a rabbi, had given her a special prayer. \"That people shouldn’t malign me or put me in positions, or ask for things I shouldn’t do,\" she said. \"That I should make the right decisions, because we are all human beings, and don’t have any ability to see the future.\" There are precedents for what Judge Freier has accomplished, but not many. In Israel, a small group of ultra-Orthodox women have formed  a political party to run for office, despite opposition from rabbis who still disapprove of women entering public life. In 2013, a Hasidic woman in Montreal ran for a local City Council seat and won. And in the Bible, there is a female judge in the Book of Judges: Devora, or Deborah, a prophetess who calls the Israelites to battle. But there has not been a female ultra-Orthodox judge for centuries, certainly not within the Hasidic movement, which was founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe. Judge Freier recalled that her rebbetzin told her, \"If God gave us Devora, the judge, if we have that in our history, that means that Ruchie Freier should be a judge. That’s it!\" Yet Justice Freier is careful not to call herself a feminist. For her, it is a radical charge that would imply she wants to overstep and reject traditional gender boundaries. That could lead to community members ostracizing her and her family, which could limit her ability, for example, to arrange marriages for her two unmarried daughters. So she stays away from controversial gender issues. She does not want to be a judge in a religious rabbinical court, a strictly male domain that rules over many civil matters for ultra-Orthodox Jews. She does not pray in the men’s section of the gender-segregated synagogues. She does not want to wear a Tallis, a traditional male prayer shawl, as some Reform Jewish women now do. \"I wanted to succeed, but I wanted to do it from within my community,\" she said. \"I love Borough Park, I love the people here. I didn’t want to break away.\" Just after 5 p.m., Judge Freier took the bench. She would see a steady stream of turnstile jumpers, low level assault cases, drug users and order-of-protection violators until 1 a.m. A swirl of public defenders, prosecutors and police officers surrounded her. Night court is the emergency room of criminal court, a tough shift that tends to fall to new judges. On an average night in the misdemeanor part, she will arraign up to 50 men, deciding whether they should be released while awaiting trial or remanded on bail. On that evening, some cases took 5 minutes — the district attorney recommended release, and she agreed. On others, she asked questions for 20 minutes or more. Judge Freier never expected to be in criminal court. She won a seat in Civil Court. But in New York, an administrative office decides where to put judges, and she was assigned to criminal court a few weeks before she started in January. She has been nonetheless energized by the task. The New York City judicial system under Mayor Bill de Blasio is moving toward alternatives to bail, such as vocational training and supervised release, for low-level crimes. Judge Freier has embraced the trend. A young defendant came up, accused of misdemeanor assault of his girlfriend. Judge Freier inquired into his record, and found out that his past offenses consisted of stealing MetroCards and using marijuana. She reduced his bail from $2,500 to $250. Another man, obviously mentally ill, stood before her. He had exposed himself and masturbated in a Popeye’s restaurant. She took her time and decided to release him before trial with mandated mental health treatment, even though the district attorney recommended he be held on $5,000 bail. She is inspired by two things, she said later: the possibility of making a positive change for a defendant, and her own volunteer experiences within the ultra-Orthodox community counseling teenagers who had turned to drugs and other vices. She found time and time again that they were not bad children; they were just doing bad things. \"I want you to understand the importance of what’s being offered to you in court,\" she told a 17-year-old who had been charged with possession of a knife, offering to dismiss the charges if he stays out of trouble for six months. \"I want you to choose your friends, stay in school, do your schoolwork, and stay out of trouble, because you’ve got potential, but it’s in your hands.\" Judge Freier was raised in a traditional ultra-Orthodox home in Borough Park, graduating from an ultra-Orthodox high school for girls that discouraged college. Shortly afterward, she married a Hasidic man, David Freier, and became a legal secretary to support his Judaic studies. Then Mr. Freier, who is now a mortgage broker, decided to go to college so he could earn money for the family. That was already a groundbreaking decision among the insular ultra-Orthodox, where even for a man to enroll in a secular university was rare. At his graduation, Mrs. Freier remembers saying to herself, \"It’s my turn,\" she recounted in a speech to an Orthodox Union women’s group in June. Her husband agreed. Over the next 10 years, she graduated from Touro College, and Brooklyn Law School. By then, she was 40, with six children. More opportunities have opened up for Hasidic women in recent years, with some women pursuing flexible or online degrees in fields like accounting or special education, even as some ultra-Orthodox rabbis continue to disapprove of college for women. Law school, however, had little precedent. \"At every stage, everyone said, it’s never going to happen,\" she told the women’s group. Even Hasidic women have had mixed feelings about her choices. \"O.K., she’s a superwoman, Ruchie Freier, she’s great, she dresses modestly, her deportment is modest,\" said Mrs. Engelman, the Satmar great-grandmother from Williamsburg, explaining the more conservative view of her generation. \"She’s one in a million. But there isn’t this tremendous yearning to want to be like her. We think, ‘I have my career at home, I want to excel in what I am doing.’\" Yet when Judge Freier passed the bar in 2006, her first clients were Hasidic men from the ultra-strict Satmar sect, who needed help with real estate transactions and liked that she spoke Yiddish, she recalled. (Judge Freier, by marriage, is part of the Bobov Hasidic sect.) Her real estate practice grew. Still, the idea that she could parlay her experience to win a local judicial election was unthinkable. So many factors fell into place to make it happen that her oldest son, Moshe, 30, said he didn’t expect to see such a thing again in his lifetime. For one, it was actually her uncle and mentor, Judge David I. Schmidt, who held the seat she would win in her judicial district, which includes Borough Park. He retired in 2015, after his legal secretary sued him, claiming she was fired in 2014 for complaining about his inappropriate sexual comments in the office. Then her opponents in the Democratic primary both had legal trouble. The Daily News reported before the September vote that Morton M. Avigdor, who had the support of local Democratic elected officials, had misused more than $500,000 from an estate of which he was an executor. Her other opponent, Jill Epstein, a secular Jew, had been censured by a panel of judges for failing to respond to inquiries on an ethical matter. Voters \"must go with Freier,\" The Daily News urged in an editorial. She ran a spirited but careful campaign. Her Yiddish theme song, broadcast from four S.U.V.’s covered with fliers on Election Day, referred to her as Mrs. Freier, not by her first name. Her fliers didn’t feature her photograph, to avoid charges of immodesty. Her husband, not she, gathered the endorsements of 10 local rabbis, who praised both \"Mr. and Mrs. Freier\" in a letter for their good works in the community. Mr. Freier, 56, a soft-spoken man with a graying beard who jokes that he is now referred to as the judge’s husband, said that he thinks her record of service made the difference. \"They liked what she did with the ambulance service, the at-risk youth,\" he said. Of all her causes, it is the EMS service about which Judge Freier seems most passionate, perhaps because of the ongoing struggle to keep it alive. Ultra-Orthodox women in Brooklyn had tried to form an all-female emergency service since the 1980s, mostly to help women in emergency birthing situations, she said. But it never happened. Judge Freier pushed for it. In the years that she worked as an attorney in private practice, she signed up for an emergency medical technician course with her mother, who had always told her she could do anything, \"unless it’s illegal, immoral or against the Torah,\" she said. When the powerful male-run Jewish ambulance service, Hatzolah, declined to open to female volunteers at her request in 2011, Judge Freier applied for a license for a separate female EMS service, Ezras Nashim. It opened with some 20 volunteers in 2014. When local rabbis were reluctant to support it publicly, her husband went to Israel and filmed himself getting rabbinical approval from senior sages. Ezras Nashim, she said, is not about being a feminist, but about reclaiming the traditional role of women to help in their own God-given way. It is the same sentiment that drives her other work. \"We aren’t saying the men aren’t good,\" Judge Freier said. \"But there is something different about us just by the fact that we’re women. We are bringing something that you can’t give.\" The service, which she still leads as director, was recently named EMS agency of the year by the city and state emergency medical service councils. Right now, its women respond in their own cars to emergencies, and they help the 911 ambulance dispatched to the scene. But it is now applying for its own ambulance license and in the coming months will face a public hearing at which Hatzolah and other services can object. Judge Freier is girding herself for the hearing, even looking forward to it. She has been practicing what she will say. \"I want someone to look me in the face and say that religious women can’t do it,\" she said, as she drove to court in her minivan. \"I want to see who is going to have the nerve to face me and say, ‘Jewish women aren’t capable.’ I feel bad; I am going to make mincemeat out of that guy.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/nyregion/judge-ruchie-the-hasidic-superwoman-of-night-court.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Azzedine Alaïa, Fashion’s Most Independent Designer, Is Dead at 82', 'text': ' Azzedine Alaïa, one of the greatest and most uncompromising designers of the 20th and 21st centuries, died on Saturday in Paris.

Known as a sculptor of the female form, and worn by women from Michelle Obama to Lady Gaga, Mr. Alaïa was equally famous for his rejection of the fashion system and his belief that it had corrupted the creative power of what could be an art form. He rarely hewed to the official show calendar, preferring to reveal his work when he deemed it ready, as opposed to when retailers or the press demanded it. Instead he built his own system, and family of collaborators and supporters, and since the turn of the millennium had become an increasingly important voice for the value of striving to perfect and explore a single proprietary aesthetic, and against giving in to the relentless pressure to produce collections. \"I dressed women directly on their body, by intuition. This is how I gained experience,\" he once said. His kitchen, where he was famous for holding free-flowing lunch and dinner gatherings, for which he often cooked, was his soapbox. There he would regale guests — who could include designers, Kardashians, the artist Julian Schnabel, the architect Peter Marino and seamstresses from his ateliers — long into the night with opinions, stories and exhortations. He \"changed my conception of fashion,\" said Nicolas Ghesquière, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton, in a documentary on Mr. Alaïa made by the stylist Joe McKenna and released this year. \"I thought fashion was about embellishment as a kid, and when I saw Azzedine’s work I understood fashion was about construction and architecture too. To have an amazing idea and the capacity to realize it yourself is the definitive act of a designer.\" Diminutive in stature — at least compared to supermodels like Naomi Campbell, who called him \"Papa,\" as he was a guardian of sorts for her in Paris at the beginning of her career, and Farida Khelfa — he was always attired in a uniform of black Chinese cotton pajamas. He was famous for working long hours alone, bent over patterns and pieces of fabric, with National Geographic programs playing on the wide-screen TV nearby next to a pillar collaged with photos of friends and their families. He was also mischievous: He often lied about his age, once told a journalist that his mother was a Swedish model, and liked to hide from his staff members and then startle them by jumping out with a whistle. Prone to holding grudges, fond of animals (he had three dogs — including a St. Bernard — and eight cats), he could also be extraordinarily generous. Mr. Alaïa dedicated his life to the belief that fashion was more than just garments; to him, they were as much an element in the empowerment of women and of a broader cultural conversation. An exhibit of his work in 2015 at the Villa Borghese in Rome, where his gowns held their own among the Caravaggios and Berninis, suggested that he had achieved that goal. Azzedine Alaïa was born in Tunis, Tunisia, on Feb. 26, 1935 (though some biographical sources list his birth year as 1939 or 1940). He had a twin sister and a younger brother, and his father ran a wheat farm outside the city. Azzedine became interested in art and design at a young age. \"I was helping Madame Pinot, a midwife that helped in giving birth to my whole family,\" he recalled in an interview with the fashion magazine The Ground in 2011. \"I told her that I liked to draw. She gave me books, pamphlets to art exhibitions, and my first book of Picasso.\" Soon she registered him at the School of Fine Arts in Tunis, he said, \"against my father’s will.\" He also found a job in a small dress shop. \"The owner was looking for someone to finish up the dresses,\" he said. \"My sister had learned sewing with the nuns, and she had a notebook with all the basics. That was my first real experience with fashion, and while I was in the shop, I improved dramatically.\" He added: \"Close to the boutique, there was a beautiful palace where two wealthy girls spent their days looking out the balcony. They saw me going in and out of the shop with cartons and fabrics, and finally, one day after school, they came up to question me about my work and invited me to their house that same night.\" There Mr. Alaïa met a cousin of the girls’ who wore Christian Dior and Balmain dresses, and through her he found work with a dressmaker who made copies of Balmain clothing. From there, with help from a well-connected friend of the cousin’s, he went to Paris, to work for Dior, in 1957. Living in the \"chambre de bonne\" of Comtesse Nicole de Blégiers, he paid his rent by making clothes for her and babysitting her children. Word spread, and he became an inside secret of the great and good of French society; clients included the writer Louise de Vilmorin, Cécile and Marie-Hélène de Rothschild, of the banking family, and the actress Arletty. He opened his own maison in 1979. Mr. Alaïa introduced his first ready-to-wear collection in 1980 and was soon hailed as \"the king of cling\" — though his garments were much more than that: He used leather and knits to shape and support the body, transforming it into the best version of itself. He eschewed external decoration for internal integrity, weaving pattern and adornment into the weft of the garment itself in ways that were almost undetectable to the outside eye. Celebratory of feminine physicality without falling into the trap of exploiting it, his work coincided with and helped create the supermodel phenomenon. His shows, rarely publicized, without any of the bells and whistles that now are now de rigueur, were nevertheless among the most influential and jam-packed. He didn’t care, and people were often kept waiting for hours until he was ready. \"He’s an artist at the end of the day, and he doesn’t have any sense of time,\" said Ms. Campbell in Mr. McKenna’s film. \"I remember [at model] Stephanie Seymour’s wedding, at the reception after the church wedding, and he was still stitching our bridesmaids dresses. He cannot let it be seen until it is completely finished.\" Though his aesthetic fell out of fashion with the advent of deconstructed minimalism in the 1990s, Mr. Alaïa never allowed himself to be distracted by the pressures of others, and by the year 2000 acolytes began returning to his atelier, a complex of buildings on Rue de Moussy in the Fourth Arrondissement, where he lived, worked and cooked (and later opened a three-apartment hotel). They were drawn by both his work and what he stood for: independent thought in an industry ruled by trend. Indeed, one of the hallmarks of Mr. Alaïa’s clothes was their timelessness; they could be worn for decades, because they were not rooted in any identifiable season. As Artforum wrote in a review of a retrospective at the Palais Galliera and Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 2013: \"The 40 decades of Alaïa’s work shown here reveals no defining trends, only an increasing interest in the refinement of technique, a kind of reverse neoclassicist ethos that lends soft flesh and airy fabric the smooth, uncanny weightiness of sculpture.\" Prada bought a stake in the business (later sold back to Mr. Alaïa), allowing it to become a force in accessories. In 2002 a number of Yves Saint Laurent’s former couture staff joined Alaïa after Mr. Saint Laurent’s retirement, including the heads of the tailoring and dressmaking ateliers. In 2007, Compagnie Financière Richemont, the Swiss luxury group that also owns Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, became a significant investor, confirming Alaïa as an industry jewel and allowing it to expand at its own pace. A perfume was introduced and store expansion planned, and by last year Mr. Alaïa had more than 300 points of sale globally. His closest collaborator was Carla Sozzani, owner of the influential boutique 10 Corso Como. Nevertheless, at a time when designers are more often called \"chief creative officers,\" and have teams of people to interpret and realize their ideas, Mr. Alaïa continued to oversee every garment, and every detail, himself, often without stopping for weekends or vacations. \"He did everything with his hands,\" said the stylist Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele in the documentary. Though he had a house in Tunisia on the sea, he rarely managed to visit, because he was always working. Beyond the runway, Mr. Alaïa created work for the ballet and the opera, began holding art exhibitions in 2004 in the space that also houses his showroom (regular programming began in 2015 with an exhibition by the Syrian poet Adonis) and was planning a bookstore. He is survived by his partner, the painter Christoph von Weyhe; and nieces and nephews. Mr. Alaïa returned to the couture calendar in July after six years. In the audience were Jack Lang, the former French minister of culture; Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, former first lady of France (and one-time Alaïa model); Isabelle Huppert, the actress; Marc Newson, the industrial designer; and Fabrice Hergott, the director of the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. Mr. Alaïa had become the equivalent of a national treasure, and everyone was there to honor him.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/fashion/azzedine-alaia-obituary.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Malcolm Young, Whose Guitar Riffs Helped Propel AC/DC to Fame, Dies at 64', 'text': ' Malcolm Young, the guitarist and songwriter who helped found the Australian rock band AC/DC, died on Saturday. He was 64. His family confirmed the death in a statement, adding that Mr. Young had had dementia for several years. It did not say where he died. Mr. Young and his brother Angus created AC/DC and played their debut show at a Sydney, Australia, club on New Year’s Eve in 1973. The group, known for its power-chord riffs, earsplitting vocals and raucous energy, found enduring popularity and great commercial success despite waiting until 2012 to release its music catalog to iTunes. \"You need to entertain\" during a live performance, Malcolm Young said in an interview posted on YouTube, so that the audience always knows that \"something’s going to happen on that stage tonight.\" The band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. \"AC/DC’s music and approach had a worn-in, scruffy vibe that stood in stark contrast to the pretentiousness suffusing much rock music at the time,\" the Hall of Fame website said. AC/DC has sold more than 72 million albums in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2016, the band was still packing arenas full of fans wearing devil horns for the \"Rock or Bust\" world tour, and belting out hits like \"Hells Bells\" and \"Highway to Hell.\" Angus Young was the only original member of AC/DC still performing that year. Malcolm Young’s last performance with the band was in 2010 in Bilbao, Spain. At the time, he was having cognitive problems but decided to keep performing during the tour, oftentimes having to relearn guitar parts that he had written, Rolling Stone reported. Mr. Young’s nephew, Stevie Young, replaced his uncle in 2014. While Mr. Young struggled with alcoholism in the 1980s, his nephew stepped in to substitute for him. \"I wasn’t brain dead, but I was just physically and mentally screwed by the alcohol,\" Mr. Young said in an interview. The band spoke with The New York Times in 2008, on the cusp of the release of \"Black Ice,\" which would eventually receive a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album. \"People say it’s juvenile music, but pardon me — I thought rock ’n’ roll was supposed to be juvenile,\" Angus Young said. \"You sing what you know. What am I going to write about — Rembrandt?\" The band won its first Grammy in 2010, for best hard rock performance, with the song \"War Machine.\" The group’s influential album \"Back In Black\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2013. On Saturday, musicians and fans shared their memories of Malcolm Young on social media. \"I had some of the best times of my life with him on our 1984 European tour,\" the guitarist Eddie Van Halen wrote on Twitter. Ben Jolliffe, of the English rock band Young Guns, wrote: \"Absolutely broken to hear of Malcolm Young passing. Grew up with the family and he was like a second dad to me.\" Mr. Young was born on Jan. 6, 1953, in Glasgow, Scotland. His parents later emigrated to Sydney. His survivors include his wife, O’Linda; two children, Cara and Ross; his brother Angus; a sister; and three grandchildren, according to a statement on the band’s website. Mr. Young’s brother George, one of the band’s producers and songwriters, died last month. The band posted a tribute to Mr. Young on its website and social media, calling him \"the driving force\" behind its success. \"As a guitarist, songwriter and visionary he was a perfectionist and a unique man,\" the statement said. \"He always stuck to his guns and did and said exactly what he wanted.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/obituaries/malcolm-young-dead.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'He Fled Myanmar on a Deathtrap. Now He’s the ‘Luckiest Man Alive.’', 'text': ' DALLAS — Mohamed Rafiq was emaciated, close to joining the pile of dead bodies at one end of the boat, when he was rescued. Barely conscious, Mr. Rafiq was too weak to walk. Foreign sailors picked him up and gave him medicine. It was the first time, said Mr. Rafiq, 39, a Rohingya Muslim, that he had ever been treated with kindness by someone of a different ethnicity. \"I couldn’t even speak because I didn’t know how to move my mouth,\" Mr. Rafiq said recently through a translator. \"I was so hungry and so thirsty. I wished I could drink, but I could not drink.\" When help came, he added, \"I thought I was reborn.\" Mr. Rafiq, a member of one of the most persecuted ethnic groups in the world, was fleeing Myanmar in 2008, aiming to find work to support his growing family. But the ferryboat on which he and scores of other Rohingya men fled their country, with benches and no shade, became a deathtrap. The Rohingya in Myanmar are restricted to their villages by laws that prohibit them from traveling within their own country. They are a stateless people denied citizenship, rights and protection. And abuses against the Rohingya — shootings, rapes and burning of villages — have recently intensified to such an extent that United Nations officials have said they may constitute crimes against humanity. The United States secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, visited Myanmar this month and called the situation \"horrific.\" Mr. Rafiq and his family, who were separated for eight years, settled together in Dallas last year. Helping Mr. Rafiq reunite with his mother, his wife and their three children was the International Rescue Committee, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. After his rescue at sea and recovery in Sri Lanka, the International Organization for Migration helped Mr. Rafiq enter the United States and settle in New Hampshire. He heard that Dallas had a larger Rohingya community, so he moved there and began the paperwork to bring his family to America. Around age 10, Mr. Rafiq began traveling on foot to sell vegetables and cheap clothing in nearby villages. The police would beat and rob him, he said. He sometimes begged them to let him keep half his earnings, but such pleas were ignored; Mr. Rafiq said the beatings were often so severe that it was painful to walk home. He continued this work until he was about 30, when he had two children and a pregnant wife to support. He decided to join other Rohingya men in an attempt to find work in a neighboring country. Nearly 100 of them crammed onto a boat in February 2008 and set out for what they expected to be a 12-day journey to Malaysia. The engine died at sea. Thirst and hunger set in, killing more than a dozen men. Bodies eventually had to be thrown overboard because the smell was so horrible, Mr. Rafiq said. Adrift at sea for four weeks, Mr. Rafiq was stripped of energy and could not move. He watched a friend pass out and die after he drank seawater. \"I am ready to die,\" he recalled thinking. Then the Sri Lankan Navy found the boat drifting in the Bay of Bengal. \"Two young men grabbed me by my arms. They pulled me out from the boat,\" Mr. Rafiq said. \"They gave me an injection because I wasn’t able to speak. After two or three days I got better, and they gave me soft food, spoon by spoon.\" Mr. Rafiq’s mother, Sara Khatoon, 60, said concern for her son was compounded by the complete lack of news about what had happened to the men on the boat. \"For two months after he left I did not receive any information about my son,\" she said. \"I didn’t know where he was.\" A tremendous sense of relief spread through the village after the BBC reported that a foreign navy had found a boat full of skeletal men clinging to life. A woman came to Mr. Rafiq’s mother and told her, \"Your son survived, and my son survived,\" she said. Mr. Rafiq and the other survivors were brought to a refugee camp in Sri Lanka, where he said he was unable to speak for a month. He made a clawing motion at his throat, saying that it felt so dry that he could not make a sound. When he finally could talk, he asked to call his family. He called the one person in his village who had a cellphone. Mr. Rafiq’s wife, Nur Hasina, 33, recalled the villager running to her with the phone. \"When I heard his voice,\" Ms. Hasina said through an interpreter, \"I asked him: ‘Where have you been? It has been too long. We have not heard anything from you.’ He said: ‘I cannot explain it right now. It’s a very long story. I will talk to you later, but I am alive and in Sri Lanka.’\" Mr. Rafiq and the other survivors refused to be sent back to Myanmar for fear of torture and execution. He stayed in Sri Lanka for four years, spending most of his time living in group housing provided by the Muslim Aid charity. After arriving in Dallas in 2013, he began working with the International Rescue Committee to reunite with his family. His family had no legal rights to leave Myanmar, so they followed his instructions to sneak into India. They told border guards that they were traveling to Bangladesh for medical treatment, paid bribes and had other relatives furtively pass them their documents over a fence at the border. After two years in India, Mr. Rafiq’s mother, wife and three children arrived in Dallas in August 2016. \"I was so happy when I saw them,\" Mr. Rafiq said. \"I was thankful to the U.S. government, the community and the people who helped to have my family reunite with me. I thank all of them, and God,\" Mr. Rafiq said. \"I have three children, but my youngest one didn’t recognize me. I needed to talk to her a lot, and after that she started talking to me.\" The family of seven lives in a two-bedroom apartment with a tiny kitchen in an apartment complex filled with other refugees. Congolese and Bosnian children played soccer outside in mid-November as Mr. Rafiq talked of his new life and the arrival of the couple’s fourth child over the summer. Asked several times to describe his family’s needs, Mr. Rafiq would say only that he had to keep his 2002 Toyota running to get to his job as a dishwasher and that he faced $4,000 in medical bills for his mother’s high blood sugar. The family says her worries about the relatives she left behind in Myanmar exacerbate her health issues. Mr. Rafiq walks with a limp and suffers back pain and memory problems from the beatings he once endured. But he says he is living a privileged life. \"I feel like I am the luckiest man alive — I can build my life in the United States,\" he said. \"Here it’s easy. I was dying on the boat. Compared to that here, in America, it’s easy.\" His gratitude is mixed with anguish about the staggering atrocities unleashed back home on his fellow Rohingya in August. He said he watched news of the mass murders on his cellphone and cried. He worries for relatives who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh and India. \"I want to donate some money to my sisters and their family in Bangladesh; I won’t use any money here for Thanksgiving,\" he said. \"I am fine, but they are suffering.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/nyregion/he-fled-myanmar-on-a-deathtrap-now-hes-the-luckiest-man-alive.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Why People in Mississippi Have to Watch the Giants', 'text': ' Most football fans in the South who turn on CBS at 1 p.m. Sunday to watch N.F.L. football will see Baltimore at Green Bay. A much smaller portion of the audience in the South — mostly those living in Florida — will see Jacksonville at Cleveland. And then there is the pocket of TV viewers in Mississippi who will be shown Kansas City at the Giants. The Giants are a very bad team, and the Chiefs are not exactly Mississippi’s team. So what’s the explanation? On each Sunday during the football season, CBS and Fox broadcast several football games simultaneously, but send only one to your home. The process by which the networks decide which game you will see is called regionalization. At CBS, the executives Rob Correa and Kelly Wood, along with a team of researchers and staff members, decide which one. Each week, they prepare a preliminary schedule for three weekends out, a tentative schedule for two weekends out and a final schedule for one weekend out. \"We never know what week it is,\" Correa said. \"We literally come in on Sunday and go, ‘What week is it?’ \" There are compelling — and often contradictory — justifications for placing certain games with each of the 200-plus CBS affiliates, but generally it comes down to predicting which game will draw the biggest rating. Strategy, Correa dismissed, is \"a fancy word for picking the best games.\" But Correa and Wood can’t put the games just anywhere. There are myriad N.F.L. rules, broadcast restrictions and requests from local CBS affiliates influencing the process. They must consider esoteric sports-broadcast issues like home blackouts, flexing, cross flexing, prime flexing, constants, mandatory pullouts, primary markets, secondary markets and protected games. In other words, it’s not as easy as, \"Hey, everybody either really hates or really loves the Patriots, so let’s just put that game on everywhere.\" Here is how CBS went about regionalization for Week 11. Week 11 is a doubleheader week for CBS, meaning it is showing games in both an early window (1 p.m., Eastern time) and a late window (4:25 p.m.). CBS and Fox have nine doubleheader weeks and eight singleheader weeks apiece throughout the season. When a network has a doubleheader the other network has a singleheader; the exception is Week 17, when they both have doubleheaders. CBS generally broadcasts the American Football Conference, while Fox broadcasts the National Football Conference. When there are interconference matchups, like the Chiefs versus the Giants, the conference of the road team determines which network gets the broadcast. But some matchups are \"cross-flexed\" onto networks they wouldn’t normally be on. In Week 11, this means the Buffalo at Los Angeles Chargers game — between two A.F.C. teams — is on Fox. Therefore, CBS has three games in the early window and two in the late window. Kansas City at the Giants is the early-window game with the widest footprint, going to about 45 percent of the country. This game will be seen widely in the New York and Kansas City areas, as well as in New England and the areas of Kansas City’s A.F.C. West rivals. The game’s reach across the Mid-Atlantic will be constrained because Baltimore is playing at the same time. And what about that portion of Mississippi that will be served Chiefs-Giants? Giants quarterback Eli Manning starred at the University of Mississippi, and CBS believes that a lot of people in the state still want to watch him play. Individual players are usually not important enough to dictate where a broadcast goes, but there are a few exceptions — mostly quarterbacks who are from, or who attended college in, places other than major metropolitan areas. Besides Manning, Carson Wentz (North Dakota State), Deshaun Watson (Clemson), Teddy Bridgewater (Louisville) and Marcus Mariota (born in Hawaii) are among the players who might influence a broadcast decision. \"J.J. Watt, as unbelievable of a player he is, is not changing our map,\" Correa said. (Watt, who plays for the Houston Texans, is from Wisconsin and was a standout at the University of Wisconsin.) Five cities, comprising about 9 percent of the country’s population, will not get any N.F.L. game at all on CBS at 1 p.m.: Minneapolis, Chicago, Houston, New Orleans and Miami. The N.F.L. long maintained strict blackout rules to compel fans to fill stadiums; until 2014, games that were not sold out were not broadcast at all in their home markets. But those rules have all but withered away. The last important rule remaining is that no N.F.L. game can be broadcast opposite a home team in its primary market. At 1 p.m. Sunday, the Vikings, the Bears, the Texans, the Saints and the Dolphins are all playing at home — those games will be broadcast on Fox — so CBS cannot broadcast a game in those areas. Similarly, Fox will not be broadcasting games in New York, Green Bay or Cleveland. In the late window, 4:25 p.m., Eastern time, about 86 percent of the country will watch New England play Oakland in Mexico City. But the timing of when CBS flips from the early to the late game, or whether it flexes out of the game because it’s a blowout, depends on where you live. Oakland and most of Northern California, as well as Boston and some of New England, are designated mandatory pullout markets. Even if the early game runs long, even if it is the greatest game in N.F.L. history, these markets will be pulled out to see the New England at Oakland kickoff. Only a small percentage of markets are designated mandatory pullouts. \"You don’t want to be pulling people out of a game; it could be a great game,\" Wood said. On the flip side are the constant markets. By N.F.L. rules, if a team has an 18-point lead or greater in the third quarter, CBS can switch viewers to a different, more competitive game. But some markets — mostly those that were mandatory pullouts, plus a few others — are constants, meaning CBS will not switch them away from the game in progress. Twelve days before a given Sunday’s games, CBS sends out tentative game assignments to its affiliates. A small number of affiliates usually respond with requests — to receive a different game or to have their constant or mandatory pullout status changed. CBS accedes to most of these requests. Six days before a given Sunday’s games, CBS sends out final game assignments. It makes changes based on affiliate requests, as well as any major developments in Sunday’s games. A game’s footprint may decrease after a star is injured, for example, or increase after two teams score upset victories and enter the playoff picture. Week 11’s final assignments look quite similar to the preliminary assignments. Eight game assignments were changed in the 1 p.m. window, all because of affiliate requests. Seven affiliates dumped the Baltimore at Green Bay matchup, mostly switching to the Kansas City at Giants game. Thirty-six hours before the games, nothing will change. Well, unless … \"Unless a game moves, nothing is going to change,\" Wood said. \"Which has happened,\" Correa interjected. \"Hurricanes or snowstorms. Remember the one in Philly, where they got like two inches of snow? \"You remember all this crazy stuff.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/sports/football/why-people-in-mississippi-have-to-watch-the-giants.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'College Football: Oklahoma State’s Slim Playoff Hopes Wither', 'text': ' Byron Pringle caught three touchdown passes and returned a kickoff for a score, helping visiting Kansas State stun No. 10 Oklahoma State, 45-40, on Saturday. Oklahoma State nearly erased a 29-point deficit in the second half, but Kansas State held on to become bowl eligible for an eighth consecutive season. Pringle, a junior, caught four passes for a career-high 166 yards. His kickoff return touchdown covered 89 yards. He entered the game with eight career touchdowns, and he had never scored more than two in a game. The freshman Skylar Thompson threw for 204 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 93 yards and a score in his second start for the injured Jesse Ertz. Kansas State entered the game as a nearly three-touchdown underdog, something Coach Bill Snyder had discussed with his team. \"I can understand why that number was out there,\" he said. \"We all knew it wasn’t an accurate number, but I told them, ‘You’re going to have to go out there and prove it.’ And we proved it tonight.\" Oklahoma State’s Mason Rudolph passed for 425 yards and three touchdowns and ran for a score. James Washington caught eight passes for 159 yards and two touchdowns for the Cowboys, who are No. 13 in the College Football Playoff rankings. Rudolph threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Dillon Stoner, cutting Kansas State’s lead to 45-40 with just over four minutes to go. The Wildcats went three-and-out, giving Oklahoma State a chance to take the lead, but Rudolph missed four straight passes, and Kansas State ran out the clock. It was Oklahoma State’s third home loss, and it crushed the Cowboys’ already slim chances of reaching the playoff. Mike Gundy, the Cowboys’ coach, said, \"We all need to look at ourselves and figure out what’s going on, because for whatever reason, we’re not showing up.\" Brandon Wimbush threw for 164 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a score as Notre Dame rallied in the rain and wind to beat visiting Navy. Wearing throwback uniforms with the name Rockne on the back of each player’s jersey and helmets designed to evoke the leather tops from the era of Knute Rockne, one of the Irish’s most famous names, Notre Dame, No. 8 in the playoff rankings, kept its slim national championship hopes alive heading into its regular-season finale next Saturday at Stanford. Wimbush, who threw two interceptions and lost a fumble in Notre Dame’s 41-8 loss at Miami two Saturdays ago, connected with Kevin Stepherson twice and added his 14th rushing touchdown of the year as the Irish scored on three straight possessions late in the game, part of the longest-running matchup between teams from different regions of the country, dating to 1927. Alex Hornibrook’s 24-yard touchdown pass to A. J. Taylor in the third quarter broke open a defensive slugfest, Kendric Pryor scored on an end-around, and Wisconsin remained undefeated with a victory at home over Michigan. The Badgers, No. 5 in the playoff rankings, padded their playoff résumé in a grinding, physical matchup against the Wolverines, who are No. 24 in the playoff rankings. Hornibrook completed 9 of 19 passes for 143 yards and bounced back from an interception early in the third quarter with some of his best throws of the season. He connected with Taylor through a tight window in the end zone for a 14-10 lead with about three and a half minutes left in the third quarter. Malik Rosier threw three touchdown passes and ran for a score, and Miami pulled off its biggest comeback in five years, holding off visiting Virginia and extending its winning streak, the longest in the Football Bowl Subdivision, to 15 games. Jaquan Johnson returned an interception for a touchdown, and Miami went on a 30-0 run in the second half as it remained unbeaten. The Hurricanes, No. 3 in the playoff rankings, erased two 14-point deficits. They had lost 15 consecutive games in which they trailed at any point by such a margin, but the defense made two fourth-down stops in Virginia territory in the fourth quarter, and the Hurricanes finished 7-0 at home in the regular season for the first time since 1988. Jalen Hurts passed for 180 yards and three touchdowns in a little more than a quarter, and Alabama beat visiting Mercer, a Football Championship Subdivision team. The Crimson Tide, who lead the playoff rankings, raced to a 35-0 halftime lead in what amounted to a tuneup for their biggest game. Alabama heads to Auburn for the Iron Bowl, with the winner facing Georgia in the Southeastern Conference championship game in Atlanta. Oklahoma’s Baker Mayfield threw for 257 yards and three touchdowns after being snubbed by the Kansas captains before kickoff, leading the visiting Sooners, who are fourth in the playoff rankings, to a rout of the Jayhawks. Mayfield had tried shaking hands with the Jayhawks captains Daniel Wise, Dorance Armstrong Jr. and Joe Dineen Jr. after the coin toss, but they stared stoically back at him. Mayfield quickly pulled his hand away, clapped a couple of times and set about burnishing his Heisman Trophy candidacy. He threw touchdown passes to Rodney Anderson and Marquise Brown in the first half and then found Mark Andrews late in the third quarter, which prompted more insults between Mayfield and the Jayhawks. Kelly Bryant threw for 230 yards and three touchdowns and left the game before halftime as Clemson remained comfortably in the playoff race with a victory at home over the Citadel. The lower-division Bulldogs were out of the game quickly. After Bryant’s 14-yard touchdown pass to T. J. Chase on the Tigers’ 26th play, Clemson, No. 2 in the playoff rankings, led by 28-0. Bryant completed 17 of 22 passes before Tigers Coach Dabo Swinney started putting in backups to work on the two-minute drill before the end of the first half. The freshman receiver Tee Higgins caught six passes for 178 yards and two touchdowns, and Travis Etienne, another freshman, ran eight times for 62 yards and two touchdowns. Clemson scored on nine of its first 10 possessions and ended the game with 662 yards, its third game of more than 600 yards this season. Darius Slayton’s 50-yard scoring catch late in the first half gave Auburn the lead, and the Tigers pulled away for a victory at home over Louisiana-Monroe before next week’s visit from Alabama. Kam Martin scored two touchdowns, one rushing and one receiving, in the third quarter. Nick Ruffin scored on a 45-yard interception return in the fourth. Auburn, No. 6 in the playoff rankings, can earn a spot in the Southeastern Conference championship game with a victory over Alabama next weekend. Nick Chubb and Sony Michel led a dominant running game, and host Georgia, No. 7 in the playoff rankings, bounced back from its first loss of the season, wearing down Kentucky. Chubb rushed for 151 yards and two touchdowns, including a 55-yard burst down the sideline to seal the victory early in the fourth quarter. Michel rambled for 87 yards and three scores of his own, most notably a 37-yard touchdown that sent the Bulldogs into the half with a 21-6 lead. Ohio State scored on its first six possessions, including J. T. Barrett’s 100th career touchdown pass, as the Buckeyes routed visiting Illinois and clinched the Big Ten East title. Barrett, playing in his final game at Ohio Stadium, threw for two touchdowns and ran for one more as the Buckeyes, No. 9 in the playoff rankings, dominated from the opening kick. Barrett became the Ohio State leader in rushing yards among quarterbacks (3,070), eclipsing Braxton Miller. He now holds 35 Big Ten and program records. Saquon Barkley broke Penn State’s career touchdown record with three scores and had 208 of his 224 total yards in the first half, leading the Nittany Lions over visiting Nebraska in the highest-scoring game in Beaver Stadium history. Barkley passed Lydell Mitchell for the record with his 39th touchdown. Trace McSorley ran for a touchdown and threw for 325 yards on 24-of-36 passing with three scoring passes for Penn State. The true freshman quarterback Shawn Robinson ran for 84 yards and threw a crucial second-half touchdown in his first career start as Texas Christian won at Texas Tech and stayed in contention for a spot in the Big 12 championship game. While Robinson completed only 6 of 17 passes for 85 yards, he made a 12-yard touchdown throw to Jalen Reagor late in the third quarter, giving the Horned Frogs, No. 12 in the playoff rankings, a 17-3 lead. McKenzie Milton threw four touchdown passes and ran for a score as Central Florida comfortably took care of business at Temple, remaining unbeaten as it heads into a showdown with its rival South Florida. The Knights, No. 15 in the playoff rankings, scored 17 points on three first-half turnovers by Temple inside its 25. They took a 31-10 lead when Gabriel Davis stretched across the goal line for a 5-yard touchdown reception with just over two and a half minutes left in the second quarter. ■ Kurt Rawlings threw for 177 yards and a touchdown to lead host Yale over its rival Harvard, 24-3, securing the Bulldogs’ first outright Ivy League championship in 37 years. Running backs Melvin Rouse and Zane Dudek combined for 106 yards rushing for Yale, which beat Harvard for a second straight season after previously losing nine in a row in the rivalry known as the Game. ■ Josh Wainwright had a career-high 13 catches for 127 yards and a touchdown, setting Columbia’s single-season record for receiving yards, and the Lions finished at 8-2 in one of the most successful seasons in program history with a 24-6 victory at home over Brown. ■ Richard Lagow threw two touchdown passes, and Morgan Ellison ran for two more scores as host Indiana shut out Rutgers, 41-0. ■ Trevor Moore kicked a 39-yard field goal with five seconds left, giving North Texas a wild 52-49 victory at home over Army, ending the Black Knights’ six-game winning streak. ■ Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson had another big game against visiting Syracuse, accounting for 381 yards and four touchdowns and becoming the Cardinals’ career yardage leader while leading a rain-delayed 56-10 rout. ■ Austin Longi and Chase Edmonds each broke free for long touchdowns late in the game as Fordham rallied past visiting Bucknell, 20-9, in a wet and windy Patriot League season-ender. ■ Ryan Fulse ran for 192 yards and three touchdowns, and Wagner defeated host Sacred Heart, 28-15, in a Northeast Conference season finale. ■ Tre Solomon scored on a 3-yard run with just over two minutes left to play, Jacob Martin broke up a pass on third-and-goal from the 1 on the final play, and Penn capped its season with its fourth win in a row, a 29-22 victory over visiting Cornell. ■ Jared Gerbino ran for a career-high 202 yards and four touchdowns, including the clinching score with no time left, as host Dartmouth beat Princeton, 54-44, in a regular-season closer for both teams.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/sports/college-football-oklahoma-state-michigan.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Now a Promoter, Evander Holyfield Tries to Find the Next Real Deal', 'text': ' Evander Holyfield — the former four-time heavyweight champion and two-time conqueror of Mike Tyson who amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in his boxing career — went to the closet in a hotel room across from Kennedy Airport on Wednesday afternoon and retrieved an iron and ironing board. He went to work on putting a fresh crease into a pair of pants he was planning to wear to the Knicks-Jazz game later that night. \"Ain’t nobody can do something better than you can do it yourself,\" he said. Holyfield, 55, is now trying to make it as a boxing promoter and using the same qualities in his new role that he used as a fighter: determination, self-reliance and supreme confidence in his own abilities leavened with a dash of modesty and perhaps more than a touch of naïveté. \"I always did a little bit more work than everybody else,\" Holyfield said of his success in the ring. That, of course, is a gross oversimplification. Hard work alone could never enable a man to beat Larry Holmes, George Foreman and Riddick Bowe, or mercilessly pummel Tyson twice, the second time so humiliatingly that Tyson resorted to biting off a chunk of Holyfield’s ear just eight minutes into their 1997 rematch. What Holyfield was able to accomplish was the result not only of hard work but of superior athletic talent, endurance, durability and self-belief. Such achievements hardly seemed possible with the 6-foot-2, 177½-pound body he took out of the 1984 Olympics. So it comes as little surprise that Holyfield now believes he can conquer the business of boxing the way he once ruled the sport. \"If I didn’t think I could be the biggest and the best, I wouldn’t get into this,\" Holyfield said. \"That’s always been my thing. If I can’t do this better, why even waste my time?\" Holyfield’s promotional company, the Real Deal Boxing, will hold its fourth card on Saturday night at Resorts World Casino, which is adjacent to Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens. There will be about 2,000 people in attendance, give or take a couple hundred, and not one of the fighters on the card is yet a household name outside of his or her own home. (There are two women’s bouts on the program.) Nor is there any television coverage, although fans can watch a free live stream on Holyfield’s website, therealdealboxing.com. \"We’re not making as much money on this as we would like, but we’re only six months old,\" said Eric Bentley, who wears several hats in the company, including chief operating officer and matchmaker. \"We’re just trying to build our brand and attract a larger audience. We want fans to see what we’re doing. This whole thing is in its infancy right now.\" The main event is a 10-round bantamweight bout between Duke Micah, a Ghanaian living in the Bronx who is unbeaten in 20 fights with 18 knockouts, and Jose Santos Gonzalez, a Mexican journeyman with a 23-4 record. Also on the card is Edgar Berlanga, a New York middleweight whom Holyfield considers one of the jewels of his 36-fighter stable, but he has had just five professional fights, winning all of them by knockout, and is still fighting in six-rounders. \"My thing is, I want to give guys the opportunity to become something,\" Holyfield said. \"I can’t fight for them, but I think they have the ability with the right opportunity. And good guy or bad guy, without promotion, you don’t go nowhere.\" It is a lesson Holyfield said he learned from Main Events, the promoters he signed with after returning from the Los Angeles Games with a bronze medal as a light-heavyweight after being disqualified for knocking out New Zealand’s Kevin Barry with a punch ruled to have landed on the break. \"They knew everybody,\" he said. \"All I knew was how to fight.\" He learned other lessons, as well, from Don King, who \"inherited\" him after Holyfield knocked out Tyson in their first bout in 1996. \"There was something about me King didn’t like,\" Holyfield said. \"He used to tell me I needed him to build me up, that I wasn’t a name.\" Holyfield, who had won the heavyweight title for the third time with that 11th-round TKO, knew that wasn’t the case. \"I grew up in the ghetto, so I know what brainwashing is,\" he said. \"Make a person feel like they need you or they ain’t nothing. I wasn’t going to fall for that. My mama brought me up smarter than that.\" It was from his mother, Annie Holyfield, a cook in a hotel restaurant but also a fine skater and runner, that Holyfield said he believed he inherited his athletic ability. She was also where he came by his toughness. Annie Holyfield, a single mother of nine, instilled in him a sense of responsibility that he carries to this day. He did not meet his father until he was 21. \"My mama said life is about accountability,\" Holyfield said. \"If you take responsibility for things you did, you’ll be a lot better off. If you live a lie, those lies will eat you up.\" Lou and Dan Duva of Main Events never quite knew what to make of the quiet, stoic young man who refused to take advantage of his newfound wealth and fame. After they turned pro in November 1984, the Duvas took Holyfield, along with his teammates — the gold medalists Tyrell Biggs, Mark Breland, Pernell Whitaker and Meldrick Taylor — to a mall on a shopping spree. \"The other guys were loading up with two and three pairs of basketball shoes,\" Holyfield said. \"But I wouldn’t take nothing. I didn’t cuss, I didn’t disrespect nobody, and I didn’t ask for nothing. I wasn’t a follower, and they couldn’t understand it. But I felt like, ‘I’m a man, and I can buy my own stuff if I want to.’ I couldn’t even ask nobody for anything when I really needed it.\" He said he had taught self-reliance to his nine children, and was now trying to impart the same to his fighters. \"I know all of them want to be champions, but I tell them they got to pay the price,\" he said. \"I don’t lie to them. I tell them, I can’t make you a champion. You’ve got to do the work.\" Holyfield, who last fought in 2011 before officially retiring in 2014, squandered much of his fortune on bad investments and dealt with a couple of costly divorces and child support obligations. His $10 million, 109-room home in an Atlanta suburb went into foreclosure. He was accused of buying steroids under a clumsy alias, Evan Fields. He never failed a drug test and denied ever using steroids. \"People say: ‘Evander, you’re too nice. You let people take all your money,’ \" he said. \"But I didn’t let anyone take anything. People did what they did, and that’s to their discredit. I’ve recovered, and I learned not to put myself in those positions anymore.\" It is another lesson he said he hoped to teach as a promoter. Real Deal provides financial counseling, its own medical staff and prefight and postfight cranial imaging to all of its fighters, Bentley said. It is offering \"victory bonuses\" in addition to its purses as added motivation. And the day after every card, Holyfield said, he will take all of his fighters to a brunch at which he will personally critique each of their efforts from the night before. \"He’s a mentor to these kids,\" Bentley said. \"From the start, Evander’s position has been, we have to transcend the sport. \"He has a real chance to do that.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/sports/boxing-evander-holyfield.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The ‘Lion King’ Effect: How a Broadway Smash Changed South African Lives', 'text': ' JOHANNESBURG — Fumane Moeketsi bent her knees into a crouch, threw her hands up in the air, and tore into the opening notes of a musical she has never seen. It was the fourth time in five years that Ms. Moeketsi, the deep-voiced 23-year-old daughter of a platinum miner from a tiny village in South Africa’s Eastern Cape, had tried out to play Rafiki, the oracular mandrill, in \"The Lion King.\" She had stood in line for open auditions with hundreds of other hopefuls, and waited by the phone for callbacks that never came. She had mastered English (her first language is Sesotho) and memorized \"Circle of Life\" (she can’t read music). She had claimed a dormitory roof-deck here as her makeshift rehearsal room — a space where she could sing to the sky, without bothering her neighbors. Finally, on the last day of May, Ms. Moeketsi found herself in front of a row of folding tables occupied by \"The Lion King\" global brain trust, including the show’s award-winning director, Julie Taymor, and, hovering anxiously along a wall, Duma Ndlovu, the South African casting consultant. \"Nants’ ngonyama,\" she belted out, silencing the room with the Zulu lyric that has become the show’s signature sound. \"Bakithi baba.\" Over the last two decades, 263 South Africans, many with little formal training in singing or acting, have been dispatched all over the planet to \"Lion King\" productions staged in Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese and Spanish. Ms. Moeketsi was determined to be next. \"I want to perform,\" she said a few days later, sipping tea at a burger joint behind the storied Market Theater, long a center of anti-apartheid art, and now, in a South Africa where for many the struggle is economic, renting rehearsal rooms to Disney. \"I want to write. I want to save enough money so I can build a theater that’s close to my village. That’s my dream.\" According to Disney, the musical — about Simba, a lion cub finding his way after the death of his father — has earned more money than any other title in entertainment history. Since opening on Broadway in 1997, it has been seen by 90 million people in 24 productions that have collectively grossed $7.9 billion. Adapted from a hit animated film set in the fictional Pride Lands, the stage adaptation is rooted in South Africa by its music, much of it by the composer Lebo M., using South African languages and choral stylings. Almost every cast — and there have been many — has included eight to 12 South Africans among approximately 50 performers. \"I felt very strongly that we had to have South Africans in it from the beginning,\" Ms. Taymor said in Durban in June. She was there for a round of auditions, which continued through the summer, to assemble a largely South African-cast tour that will begin in Manila next March and then set out across Asia. This month the show celebrated its 20th anniversary. When Ms. Taymor and Thomas Schumacher, the president of Disney’s theatrical division, were developing it two decades ago, they helped persuade Actors’ Equity to allow for a contingent of South African performers; now every year Disney teams visit Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town to cast more. \"It’s like the spiritual foundation of ‘The Lion King’,\" Ms. Taymor said. The life is hard — performers, generally young adults, leave their parents, and often their children, behind, often relocating to countries where they don’t speak the language. But there is adventure to be had, art to be made, money to be earned. That’s why Ms. Moeketsi, who grew up in a home without electricity, listening to news on a battery-powered radio and hoping to one day become an announcer, started auditioning. She had moved from her village to Johannesburg for college, and, as she wrapped up her studies at the University of the Witwatersrand, she saw \"The Lion King\" as her best hope, professionally and financially. She was seeking to join a generation of South African performers who have landed jobs in the musical. Some have found new homes, new families, new careers. Others have struggled to translate the opportunity into sustained success. All have been changed. The gangster’s wife is worried. Brenda Mhlongo is seated on a plush couch in a television studio, rehearsing her reproachful stare while a makeup artist touches up her face. At the same time she and a language adviser on headset are quibbling about how best to phrase \"Where is your shirt?\" in Zulu. It’s a long way from Pride Rock. Ms. Mhlongo, 38, is a \"Lion King\" success story — a grateful alumna who parlayed a stint with Disney into a significant television career back home. She now stars on \"Generations: The Legacy,\" South Africa’s second-most popular soap opera, or soapie, playing a nurse married to a mobster. Along the way she faced years of unemployment and a spiritual crisis. But her journey illustrates the possibilities for \"Lion King\" performers who spend years on stage overseas and then try to continue working in the arts back home. \"I knew I would come back, because I wanted to make my name in South Africa,\" Ms. Mhlongo said. Filming was over; breathless after a quick wig-and-costume change, she apologized that her typically fashionable character had been dressed casually for the late-night living room scene. Ms. Mhlongo, who grew up in KwaMashu — a township north of Durban where black people were resettled during apartheid — was a teenage mother when she first saw the animated \"Lion King,\" and discovered that watching the video soothed her baby daughter. (They would skip the sad stampede scene.) She spent years performing with K-Cap (KwaMashu Community Advancement Projects), an arts program founded and led by her husband. But by 2007, when she learned that Disney was holding auditions in Durban, she was ready for a bigger stage. Although many South Africans, like Ms. Moeketsi, try out year after year, Ms. Mhlongo was hired on the spot to play Rafiki in \"Festival of the Lion King,\" a 30-minute revue, at Hong Kong Disneyland. She left a 3-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter to be raised by her husband. While there she had another stroke of good fortune: She was spotted by a vacationing Disney executive who recruited her to join the \"Lion King\" production that has been running in Germany for 16 years. But Ms. Mhlongo only lasted three months in Hamburg, before she left the show, citing \"spiritual sickness.\" Rafiki is the one principal part regularly played by a South African woman. Inspired by a sangoma, a type of South African faith healer who, according to belief, can channel ancestral spirits, the character was troublesome for Ms. Mhlongo, as it has been for other South African women, because she felt at times unable to manage dark feelings she believed the ancestors were surfacing. (Some productions keep sage and other herbs on hand as antidotes.) She recovered — \"I had to fast and pray, and at home they had to do a lot of ceremonies\" — and her career resumed. She performed in the ensemble, while understudying Rafiki, in Johannesburg and on Broadway, and then played the role on tour in North America. The show spoke to her, and to other performers, in inspirational ways — in particular, its story of a dispossessed leader spending years in exile before returning to reclaim his kingdom strikes many as having thematic echoes of Nelson Mandela. The show also resonates personally and painfully. As the lionesses ululated in mourning over the death of Simba’s father, Mufasa, Ms. Mhlongo would think of her own father, who was stabbed to death in Johannesburg when she was 13. \"When I listen to the eulogy, it’s like I’m talking to my ancestors. I’m saying, ‘Why, why did you take him?’ ’’ The peak, she said, was originating Rafiki in Spain when that production opened in 2011. The transition was jarring: there was the night her brain froze and she accidentally began a song in German. But the gig went well, and she even won some awards for the yearlong engagement. \"After that I told them, I’ve reached the ceiling,\" she said. She returned to South Africa in 2012, and, other than a brief 2013 fill-in stint in a North American tour, has been here since. \"I struggled to find work when I came back,\" she said. \"It was hard to crack.\" She now encourages other \"Lion King\" hopefuls, in part by helping her husband, Edmund Mhlongo, whose K-Cap program, independent from Disney, prepares high school graduates to audition for \"The Lion King,\" as well as more generally for careers in the arts. Students there all know whether their vocal range and body type make them more likely to be a Nala or a Rafiki, a Simba or a Mufasa, and each year they learn the audition songs, which they perform a cappella, in English, although Zulu is their primary language. Over the years, about 20 alumni have landed roles in the musical. For Ms. Mhlongo, whose face is painted on the side of the center alongside those of others trained there, the show offers a rare chance to explore the world, and the arts. \"‘Lion King’ is a university,\" she said. The house \"The Lion King\" built is gone. Thandazile Soni, the first Rafiki in Chicago, now lives in a wooden shack on a former sugar cane field southwest of Durban, down a rutted dirt path that descends as the houses become ever more ramshackle. Hers is the shabbiest — a makeshift three-room shed, with a corrugated metal roof held in place by stones, curtains to keep out critters and climate, cocks crowing and children playing in the dirt yard. There are no beds for the kids, and only a hot plate for cooking. When it rains, the structure floods; when the wind blows, everyone shivers; and when the sun beats down on that roof, they sweat. This is not the life Ms. Soni dreamed of. Not the life she worked for. Not the life she had. She has been in \"The Lion King,\" off and on, since she was 25. Now she’s 43. Ms. Soni, who goes by the nickname Thandi, was, in effect, a migrant worker in the global economy. She traveled around the world to work for Disney, moving so often she can’t remember all the cities, leaving behind children to be raised by relatives, wiring money back to support as many family members as she can. She struggled, physically and psychologically. But now she wants back in, for a simple reason — her family needs the money. \"I just want to save like there’s no tomorrow and then come back home and build for my kids,\" she said. She was seated on a twin bed in the tiny room she shares with her 10-year-old son; a jaunty straw hat sat atop her head. Pausing repeatedly to look away, catch her breath and wipe her eyes, she described herself as humbled and humiliated: \"I’ve been trying to see how on earth did everything get to this point, but trying to look back is not going to fix it.\" She left the show in the summer of 2016, hoping to take care of a college-age son who had had some kind of psychotic break while she was away. But she quickly lost a house she had purchased with her early earnings, and they wound up moving into the shack. Most of her belongings are now in storage, but just below her journal, she keeps a copy of the script and the score. Just in case. Her life story, as she tells it, is one of unrelenting woe. Raped at 10 by a neighbor, she gave birth to a child who was given to another family. A runaway at 14, she led a life she doesn’t like to detail. \"It was bad for a girl child,\" she said, rolling up her pants to show scars on her legs from a South African bullwhip called a sjambok. She was raised during the height of the struggle against apartheid, as repression and protest convulsed the country and severely limited the rights and opportunities for black South Africans. But she always had one escape — music — and she perked up as she recalled discovering that people admired her voice. \"I would find every chance I got to run away from home, go sing somewhere,\" she said. \"And then I would come back, they would beat me up a little bit, but then I’d be fine, cause I did my thing.\" As a young adult, she sang backup vocals for other artists, and joined a gospel group called the Durban Divas. For her first Disney audition, in 2001, she sang \"What Shall I Do,\" a gospel number by Tramaine Hawkins, and nailed it. The casting directors kept her for hours. Could she sing higher? Lower? Be Rafiki? Nala? Then her life changed. \"Do you have a passport?\" Lebo M., the composer, asked her. \"I didn’t even know what a passport was,\" she recalled. She was off to Denver, in the ensemble of a new national tour, and then a year later to Chicago, as Rafiki. She told her mother to buy that new house, and paid tuition for her siblings. But she also struggled, with depression, and with vocal issues. She worked in London, Hong Kong, and back on the North American tour. She had a baby (her fourth, cared for by her mother when Ms. Soni is away). She lost her voice again. She cycled in and out of the show. \"At night I tell myself, this is our waiting area, this is where we are waiting to go to our Canaan,\" she said, waving her hand around the home she likens to a tomato box. \"I want to get out so bad.\" So last spring she was back in a rehearsal room near Durban, auditioning again. The Disney team had a whispered conversation. \"It’s a positive turnaround, given what she’s been through,\" said Anthony Lyn, a supervising resident director for the show. Ms. Taymor was obviously moved. \"I love her,\" she told her team. \"I think she is amazing.\" And now, unable to make ends meet without \"The Lion King,\" Ms. Soni is going back out on the road. She didn’t get a role in the new international tour, but she did get an offer to join the ensemble in Scheveningen, a North Sea resort in the Netherlands. She is studying \"Circle of Life\" once again — this time in Dutch. Mduduzi Madela has been two kinds of antelope, an ostrich, half a wildebeest, half a rhino, and one leg of an elephant. He has sung bass, baritone and tenor. He has played a menacing hyena, and a leonine prince. For 14 years, since he was a scrawny 21-year-old, he has been crisscrossing America and Europe in \"The Lion King.\" Now he’s on Broadway, covering the role of Simba, which means that he periodically gets to perform a leading role. He is one of 36 South Africans who have made it to the Broadway cast over the last two decades; one ensemble member, Lindiwe Dlamini, has been with the show from the beginning. But what lies ahead for a South African artist who has spent his entire adult life on Pride Rock? Ms. Mhlongo found fame. Ms. Soni found hardship. Mr. Madela, who uses the nickname Mdu, is wondering what he’ll find. \"Already, I’m itching,\" he said in June in Umlazi, the Durban-area township where he grew up, during a two-month leave from Broadway. \"What next?\" He has a dream: he wants to be a music producer. He also has Ananelwe, his 2-year-old daughter — an American citizen, born of his relationship with another \"Lion King\" ensemble member, Nteliseng Nkhela — and he knows the child’s life will be affected by where they choose to live. Early this month, he found himself talking about constructing a post-show life with a group of \"Lion King\" alumni after a boisterous 20th anniversary performance that brought Elton John, one of the show’s composers, back to its stage. This spring, Mr. Madela brought Ananelwe with him to Umlazi, and arranged for a Zulu ceremony, introducing her to her extended family and, symbolically, to her ancestors; she received a goatskin bracelet, called an isiphandla, that she wears around her wrist. \"This is what I wanted her to experience — being barefoot, somewhere in Umlazi, without being in an apartment in West New York, N. J., where there’s no yard to play at, and we have to say, ‘No, don’t jump that much, because there’s a neighbor underneath who’s going to complain about the noise’,\" he said. He imagines dividing his time between the two countries, aware that many alumni of the show don’t return to South Africa, but also mindful of opportunities in the United States. \"When it comes to stability, and earnings, you get to do things that normal people do — you purchase a house, you take your kids to good schools — the very things that people aspire to,\" he said. \"But ‘The Lion King’ gets the cream of the crop when it comes to singing, and many people wind up staying where they are.\" Mr. Madela took to music early. His father, a production manager for a French electronics company, had a guitar, which he taught himself to play. His aunt gave him a keyboard; he learned that too. He wrote his first song at 12 — a love song, in Zulu — and then, under the tutelage of a high school teacher, he began reading about the songwriters Diane Warren and David Foster, and writing his own pop songs, now in English. \"The only thing I knew about ‘The Lion King’ was the movie,\" he said. \"I didn’t know there was a musical.\" But he was young, and adventurous, so when he saw an ad in a local newspaper, he auditioned, and then when a woman with a thick Dutch accent who could not pronounce his name called to offer him a job in Scheveningen, he said yes. His studies could wait. Paris, Las Vegas, the North American tour, the British tour. He saw the world. He learned to dance. He became fluent in a language he thought he would never learn — French. Finally, New York called. Broadway. \"I thought, ‘You know what? You have to be a fool to say no,’ \" he said. That was four years ago. To fend off restlessness, he takes classes and writes pop, gospel and R&B songs, and he has registered a company in the United States to publish and license his material, mostly in South Africa. \"It’s been such a beautiful, beautiful ride, and I’m grateful,\" he said. \"But I look at my daughter, and I think, I need to do more.\" Fumane Moeketsi, the 23-year-old university student who auditioned this spring, grew up on folk tales, filled with songs about hunters and giants and bears, told by relatives gathered in her family’s rural home. So when she first heard Mr. Ndlovu, the South Africa-based casting consultant, explaining the story of a lion cub exiled after his father is killed by his uncle, she was smitten: \"I want to do it,\" she said. So she auditioned. And auditioned. And auditioned. This year, her fourth, was the first time she met Ms. Taymor, and she had 12 minutes to make an impression, to sell herself as a possible Rafiki. She was nervous — sweat beading on her forehead — but ready, beaming and forceful as she began. When she sang in African languages — the show’s lyrics include words in Congolese, Sotho, Swahili, Tswana, Xhosa and Zulu — her voice was clear and sharp. But in English, her voice seemed to tremble. She rolled her R’s. Her enunciation seemed effortful. \"Try and eliminate some of the vibrato,\" said Clem Ishmael, the show’s global music supervisor. \"It’s very classical sounding,\" Ms. Taymor added. She did not mean that as a compliment. But they asked her to read a scene — the first time she had ever progressed that far — in which Rafiki tries, literally, to knock some sense into Simba. Again, Ms. Taymor heard something in Ms. Moeketsi’s tone she didn’t like. \"You sound like the most luxurious sex doll,\" she cautioned. \"Rafiki is an old baboon.\" This was progress, and Ms. Moeketsi knew it. The team was now training her. \"Find the rhythm and percussion — play with the musicality, and enunciate on the consonants,\" Ms. Taymor said. \"You understand what we’re talking about.\" And then, as Fumane turned to leave, Ms. Taymor added one more word. \"Beautiful.\" Two callbacks followed, and then the phone call Ms. Moeketsi had been craving for five years. Did she want to join the new international tour, in the ensemble and understudying Rafiki? \"My mother was in tears when I told her,\" Ms. Moeketsi recalled. \"She said, ‘I know you’re going to work hard to make sure everyone at home is taken care of.’\" She plans to return to her village one more time before departing, when she expects a sheep or a chicken to be slaughtered for a family feast, thanking the ancestors and asking for their help with a safe journey. And in Johannesburg, she is planning a party at which she will photograph advice her friends write on a whiteboard, \"so if I feel things are becoming tough, or I’m struggling, I can read the messages to encourage myself, and remind myself where I come from.\" Later this month, she will fly to Manila for a costume fitting, and then in January, she will begin rehearsing there. She expects to be in the show through 2020. That’s when the tour is due to reach South Africa.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/theater/the-lion-king-south-africa.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'When New York City Was a (Literal) Battlefield', 'text': ' New York City is a battlefield. I know what you’re thinking — psychological warfare, the endless grim clashing of economic forces — but I am being literal. When we ponder America’s defining war, the Revolution, we think of Bunker Hill, or Saratoga, or Lexington and Concord, yet its largest battle, a vast and ferociously fought chess match in August and September of 1776, right after the formal declaration of the colonies’ independence, ranged over what are now the five boroughs. As to why the place was so hotly contested, you already know the answer. Then, as now, as ever, New York City was the center of it all. Both sides believed that if the British took control of New York and the Hudson River, the American resistance would likely collapse. The battle isn’t as well known today as other encounters during the Revolution, in part because the city has done an excellent job of removing most traces of it. Where Boston sets aside hallowed historic precincts and wends a handsome brick Freedom Trail through its Revolutionary sites, New York City buries its past under mountains of concrete and steel. Hills have been flattened, islands swallowed up by landfill, shorelines redrawn. But I was determined to find Revolutionary New York, and I did eventually, after a fashion. It helped that I had an organizing principle. I was researching a book, and, since my book isn’t about military strategy I wasn’t trying to cover all of the complex maneuverings of troops. I write narrative history, which to me means focusing on people’s lives. Getting to know the places in which those lives unfolded helps me in my efforts to get into the individuals’ heads and hearts. The book tells the story of the founding era by following the interwoven stories of six people from the period, from birth to death. They include a Connecticut slave, a Seneca warrior, a British aristocrat and an Albany shoemaker. But it was because of the other two — a Virginia planter and the teenage daughter of a British officer — that I found myself going from subway to bus to ferry around the five boroughs, with old maps in one hand and Google Maps in the other. These two figures of 18th-century America were caught up in the mayhem of New York. They gave my journey through the city’s past what I always crave when I write, research or travel: a personal angle. George Washington is everyone’s touchstone for the Revolution, and I made him mine as well. To orient myself alongside the commander of the American Army in New York, I began at \"the commons,\" now City Hall Park, joining municipal workers on the benches at lunch hour. On July 9, 1776, as British soldiers were gathering on Staten Island and preparing to attack Manhattan, Washington arrayed his troops here and had the newly minted Declaration of Independence read aloud to them. The men were so roused up they charged southward and pulled down the statue of King George at what is now Bowling Green. I hiked down to the same spot and stood there, surrounded by the skyscrapers of the Financial District. Washington was furious at the lack of discipline, but pleased at the men’s ardor. The cheery mood of the troops ended abruptly. Walking a few blocks westward gave me a view of the Hudson River, where Washington was able to join the rest of the shocked town in observing two British warships race up the river with their guns blasting, sending cannonballs careering into the streets. It was a test of the American defenses; they failed. In truth, it was a harrowing situation for the would-be nation, and Washington was frankly uncertain of his ability. His military record was mixed, and most of his service had come two decades earlier, in the French and Indian War. Much of what he had learned of military leadership had been from a book. He was 44, burning with ambition but saddled with an inferiority complex due to his lack of formal education. He was learning on the fly. While he was trying to perform the impossible task of defending miles of shoreline, an odd diplomatic comedy ensued. The British wanted to negotiate, and officers arrived bearing letters intended for Washington. But the letters did not give the American commander his proper title. Washington knew how important protocol was, and refused to accept them. Then another letter arrived. Surprisingly, it was not addressed to Washington, but to a Miss Margaret Moncrieffe. She was the daughter of Major Thomas Moncrieffe, who had chosen to side with the British. The father was now on Staten Island, but Margaret was trapped behind enemy lines — i.e., in New York with the Americans — and Major Moncrieffe wanted Washington to deliver her over to him. I chose young Margaret Moncrieffe as one of my subjects in part because of this slender connection to Washington, in part because of the vibrancy of her personality, but most of all because as her life unfolded I saw her as embodying one aspect of the wider yearning for freedom that America’s Revolution was a part of: the desire of women for some measure of independence. In the summer of 1776, Margaret was only 14, but she was about to reveal her nature by standing up to the most powerful man in America. Washington likely had no idea who this girl was when the letter arrived, but he soon found out. While standing in the little grassy teardrop of Bowling Green, I focused on one of the office buildings before me, 1 Broadway, and held up over it an engraving of the structure that had once stood on or about this same spot. That building had served as the American military headquarters. Here, in the midst of preparations for war, and following the collapse of peace negotiations, Washington hosted a formal dinner. A toast was offered to the Continental Congress, the gathering of representatives from the 13 colonies in Philadelphia. General Washington noticed that the girl at the table did not raise her glass. Margaret Moncrieffe had been invited to join the American officers while they decided what to do with her. Despite having partly grown up in the city, Margaret followed her father’s loyalties and, like thousands of other New Yorkers, was rooting for the British. She now scandalized the gathering and personally affronted Washington by offering a counter toast, to Gen. William Howe, Washington’s opposite on the British side. For a moment, the reserved and deeply formal commander of American forces faced off with an impudent and headstrong teenager. Then Washington ended the standoff with a bit of levity, promising to find a way to send the girl to her father on Staten Island, and asking that once there she offer a toast to the American commanders. Since the building at the foot of Manhattan was alive with military secrets, and seeing as this girl was both observant and openly disposed toward the enemy, Washington thought it prudent to send her away until arrangements could be made to transfer her to the British. She found herself shipped to one of the many fortifications the Americans had constructed, at Kingsbridge, in the Bronx, just opposite the northern tip of Manhattan. I went there too. From the 231st Street subway it was a steady uphill hike. The fort is gone, of course. In place of farms and military outposts I found Chinese takeouts and check-cashing outlets. Then I was met by a steep set of stairs — a step-street — flanked by a Kingsbridge Heights community art project: two painted trees. I climbed the trees — that is, I marched to the top of the steps. Up here, wedged between three avenues — Sedgewick, Reservoir and Webb — lies a scallop of a playground and a weedy strip of park. Part of it, emerging from an outcropping of schist, is called Washington’s Walk. There’s a plaque marking this as the location of one of the American defensive posts. Looking up from the plaque, I saw why the spot was chosen. You’re high up. The expanse of sky is a surprise. Down below, the Jerome Park Reservoir, though man-made in 1906 and bound by land, reminds you of what these forts were for: monitoring the rivers for signs of the British Navy. Here young Margaret was meant to wait until diplomats could arrange for her to be reunited with her father. And here, improbably, she fell in love. None other than Aaron Burr, who at age 21 was already known as a ladies man, was stationed at Kingsbridge. The two young people apparently managed to find some time alone amid the soldiers and the gathering chaos, for Margaret later declared that Burr \"subdued my virgin heart.\" As a result, suddenly, she changed her mind. She had been desperate to reach her father, but now she didn’t want to leave Burr. But the two enemy commands had made their arrangements. Against her will, she was rowed out into the Hudson River and southward, toward Staten Island. I followed her, on the Staten Island Ferry. When we were somewhere in the Upper Bay — past Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, the choppy green-brown water below as somber as death — I imagined the scene of her wobbly transfer from an American to a British boat, as two armies that were about to engage in a world-historic conflict paused to do this small human thing. From the terminal on Staten Island I marched uphill to Tompkinsville Park, which I understood roughly marked the place where the British Navy gathered as General Howe prepared to attack. It was a windswept little triangle of urban greenery, hemmed in by traffic, but with a bit of wandering I was able to get a view down onto the bay, which would have been crowded with naval vessels flying the British flag. Those ships, 400 of them, were now fully occupying Washington’s mind. Where would Howe choose to strike? With no way of knowing, Washington strung his men out in a long, skinny line across six miles of Brooklyn and Manhattan shoreline. Then Howe moved: On Aug. 22, 22,000 British soldiers crossed from Staten Island more or less where the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge stands, hit the beach at Gravesend Bay in Brooklyn and began decimating the American forces. Washington stayed on Manhattan for a time, believing Howe would launch another strike there. Then from the East River shore he saw the signal lights of his men on Brooklyn Heights indicating that the whole British force was enveloping Brooklyn. He crossed the river. Cobble Hill is now the name of a neighborhood, but in the 18th century it was an actual hill. The Americans had built a fort atop it, and from here Washington oversaw the action to the south. The former bank building at Atlantic Avenue and Court Street sits where the hill stood. My plan was to get to the roof and give myself the same view Washington had. But the manager of the Trader Joe’s that now occupies the building informed me that the staircase to the roof was unsafe. I tried piecing together Washington’s view of the Battle of Brooklyn (which is also known as the Battle of Long Island) from the upper floors of the YMCA on Atlantic Avenue and the roof of a nearby apartment building. But that wasn’t very satisfying, so I ended up plunging into the battle. I marched down Smith Street, past hipster lounges, juice bars and bagel shops, past Carroll Street with its little front gardens, and turned left on Third Street. The neighborhood became industrial, which somehow seemed more suitable for mentally recreating a battlefield. Crossing the Gowanus Canal, which then was a creek, I reached the center of the fighting. With the American forces in disarray, Gen. William Alexander made a stand here, in front of the stone farmhouse of Nicholas Vechte, leading a Maryland regiment in a furious counterattack that bought time for much of Washington’s bedraggled army to retreat to Brooklyn Heights. Imagining the fight was made immensely more satisfying by virtue of the fact that the Old Stone House, a reconstruction of Vechte’s farmhouse, stands snugly in the middle of Washington Park, at Third Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Parts of the original Dutch house, around which the fighting took place, were used in the 1933 reconstruction, and the building was moved across the park from where it originally stood, but it’s still as evocative of the period as it is anomalous in the neighborhood. Even better, inside, the new permanent exhibition, which went up in 2016, is packed with interpretive displays. Most useful to me was a three-dimensional diorama that shows Brooklyn in its original hilly state. Even more challenging for me than mentally deleting the brownstones and office buildings from the landscape was appreciating its geography. The diorama makes clear why Washington decided to deploy his smaller army as he did, along a series of steep hills that ran between present-day Fulton Street and Eastern Parkway and south to Greenwood Heights. (Later I gave myself another sense of the original terrain by hiking the hills of Green-Wood Cemetery.) The Americans protected the passes between the hills, but the British found that the Jamaica Pass was unguarded and swarmed through. Washington then executed one of the most brilliant maneuvers of the war, using fog and the cover of darkness to get 9,000 soldiers safely across the East River to Manhattan. I mirrored their retreat, taking the ferry from Pier Six to Wall Street, on what turned out to be an appropriately heavy, gray morning. The escape of the American Army stunned the British, and Howe, the victor in the battle, took his time regrouping and planning how he would conquer the city and finish off Washington’s army. Washington, on the run, guessed that Howe would attack either in the south, directly on New York itself, or to the north, at Harlem. He placed an army at Corlears Hook, just north of the city, and chose the mansion of Roger Morris, a wealthy loyalist who had earlier fled the city, as his military headquarters. From here he studied maps, held court-martials and scanned the river below. The Morris-Jumel Mansion still exists, near West 160th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, and as a museum maintains its 18th-century decorum. Its revolutionary vibe was enough to draw, among others, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who lives in the same Washington Heights neighborhood; its operators allowed him to write part of \"Hamilton\" in the mansion. From here, on Sept. 15, Washington heard cannon fire that told him his guesses at where Howe would attack were wrong. The explosions were coming from the south, as 9,000 men landed at Kips Bay, near where the United Nations now sits. The redcoats stormed across Manhattan. Washington fought a brilliant battle at Harlem Heights, but Howe took New York City. Washington’s army retreated up the Hudson River, and eventually into New Jersey. Once the British had control of New York, the little city of 4,000 or so houses became, in effect, two cities: a place of stench and squalor, which had already endured much, and a genteel quarter that the British officers reserved for themselves and their families. Thus Margaret Moncrieffe made a triumphant return, and lived for a time in the center of Loyalist America. She attended the theater and danced at balls with officers, feeling for a short while that she had bested the great but stern American general with whom she had clashed. Washington was shaken to his core by the loss of New York, writing to his cousin, \"If I were to wish the bitterest curse to an enemy on this side of the grave, I should put him in my stead with my feelings.\" But war, like life, involves many twists. Despite what both sides thought, the loss of New York would not mean the end of American resolve. Washington’s side would win, and he would achieve all the honor he craved and more. Young Margaret Moncrieffe would turn out to back the losing army, and the rest of her tumultuous and ultimately tragic life, in which she would continue to defy powerful men, would unfold in Europe. I ended my search for these two personalities of 18th-century America back at 1 Broadway, in the lobby of the building, pondering the unlikely moment they came dramatically into contact with one another. And pondering, too, the many ways that New York has been, and still is, the heart of America.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/travel/new-york-city-american-revolution.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'What You Need to Know About the New ID Law and Travel', 'text': ' In the past several months, there has been plenty of conversation about the Real ID Act and how it will affect air travelers. Passed by Congress in 2005, the act is intended to prevent identity fraud, and starting on Jan. 22, 2018, fliers who reside in some states, even if they’re flying domestically, will need identification other than a driver’s license to pass through Transportation Security Administration security checkpoints at airports. Who exactly is affected and what additional identification will the T.S.A. require? Here, answers to questions about what the Real ID Act means for travelers and why having a passport now may be more important than ever. What exactly is the Real ID Act? The act is meant to ensure that a person presenting an ID is in fact who that person says they are, according to Justine Whelan, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security. \"The act prevents the production of fake IDs and ensures that all identification that is used has certain features which prevent tampering or are difficult to replicate,\" Ms. Whelan said. These features include anti-counterfeit technology, such as the holograms on some state licenses. Federally issued documents, such as a passport, also fall into the difficult-to-replicate category. Why is the act being implemented? Congress passed the act on the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission that the federal government set minimum security standards for how states issue identification and for how that identification is used. \"These security standards ensure a safer American public. At the end of the day, everyone should be who they say they are,\" Ms. Whelan said. When does it go into effect and for which states? Ms. Whelan said that Real ID enforcement has been implemented in phases over the last two years in some states. If you show up to a federal facility such as a military base, for example, and you live in a state that’s not Real ID compliant, you will need alternative identification to a driver’s license. Currently, 28 states are Real ID compliant, including Texas, Ohio, Florida, Nevada and Colorado. For a complete list, visit dhs.gov/real-id. But what does the Real ID Act mean for air travelers?  Starting Jan. 22, 2018, the T.S.A. will ask all travelers who don’t have a driver’s license from a compliant state or a state that has been granted an extension to the compliance deadline (this means that residents can continue using their noncompliant license for federal purposes while the state continues working to be in compliance) to provide an alternative form of acceptable identification. Travelers won’t be able to pass through security without this acceptable identification. And, as of Oct. 1, 2020, all air travelers will be required to have a Real ID-compliant driver’s license or alternate acceptable identification to fly domestically. What exactly qualifies as acceptable identification? The D.H.S. has designated more than a dozen forms of acceptable ID including a passport; a border ID card; a trusted traveler card, such as Global Entry; a Real ID compliant driver’s license; and a permanent resident card. For a complete list, visit tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification. Is one form of acceptable identification better than another? Ms. Whelan said that the D.H.S. does not advocate any particular form of acceptable identification, but Brenda Sprague, who oversees passport services for the U.S. Department of State, said that, with the implementation of Real ID fast approaching, residents who live in states that aren’t Real ID compliant should apply for a passport before the end of the year. November and December are the best months to apply for or renew your current passport, Ms. Sprague said, because the turnaround time to get a new passport now is usually around four weeks. In the summer, when passport applications peak, the wait for a new passport could be up to eight weeks. Around 136 million Americans have passports in circulation, according to State Department — that’s only around 40 percent of the population in the United States. O.K., you’ve convinced me, and I’m ready to apply for a new passport. What’s the best way? Ms. Sprague said that there are more than 8,000 passport application locations around the country. Around 60 percent are post offices while the rest are courthouses and libraries. Visit the Department of State’s Where to Apply link for more details. In addition, there are 27 passport agencies, where travelers can apply for rush passports. \"These agencies are for people who are traveling within two weeks,\" Ms. Sprague said. This link has a list of these agencies; applicants need an appointment for a visit and can make one online at passportappointment.travel.state.gov. Also, the State Department is collaborating with Hilton Hotels & Resorts on the Hilton Passport Project, an initiative meant to encourage more Americans to apply for passports. Every few weeks, a Hilton location in the United States will have a Passport Concierge booth, where guests and the general public can have their passport pictures taken for free and apply for or renew a passport. Between one and three employees from the State Department will be on hand to answer passport-related questions and help fill out applications. The next Passport Concierge will be at Hilton Cleveland Downtown from Nov. 9 to 11. For a list of coming locations, visit facebook.com/Hilton. How much does it cost to get a new passport? First-time applicants pay $110 plus a $25 application fee. Passport renewals cost $110 and expedited passports are an additional $60. If you’re renewing your passport, you can do it by mail, but if you’re getting a new passport or if your existing one is lost or stolen, you must apply in person.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/travel/realid-air-travel-identification.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Their Pledges Die. So Should Fraternities.', 'text': ' Following a night of heavy drinking at a fraternity at Texas State University, a 20-year-old was found dead. Another 20-year-old died at Florida State University in nearly identical circumstances. At Penn State University, the victim was 19. Security cameras and text messages documented the fumbling attempts by fraternity members to revive him and then to cover up the link between his unconscious condition and the 18 or so drinks that they forced on him in a roughly 90-minute span. As he moaned and thrashed and blood from a lacerated spleen filled his abdomen, they waited about 12 hours to summon medical help, by which point it was too late. At Louisiana State University, the victim was 18, with a blood alcohol content of .496 percent. That’s more than six times the legal limit for driving and about two and a half times the amount of alcohol that can cause someone to black out. All of these incidents occurred this year — the Texas and Florida ones in the last two weeks — and yet 2017 isn’t some nadir. At least six young men died in connection with fraternity hazing rituals in 2014, according to Hank Nuwer’s Hazing Clearinghouse, a website with a ghastly, heartbreaking tally. Two years before that, seven died. Across decades, the toll of deaths related to fraternity revelry and recklessness is surely in the hundreds. And while physical stress plays a role in some fatalities, most reflect the kind of extreme drinking that’s in the DNA of so-called Greek life. Do we need any cause beyond all of that dying to do away with fraternities wherever possible and to diminish their prominence at schools where various circumstances, including the housing that fraternities provide, prevent them from being shuttered? I don’t think so, but there are additional reasons nonetheless. On a range of fronts, fraternities — and sororities — contradict our stated values and undercut our supposed goals for higher education, putting our inconsistencies and hypocrisies under a magnifying glass. And the recent attention to scattered schools that have eradicated or curtailed Greek life has been misleading. Against all wisdom, fraternities thrive; in the new book \"True Gentlemen: The Broken Pledge of America’s Fraternities,\" John Hechinger estimates that at least 380,000 male undergraduates belong to Greek organizations, which he says represents a 50 percent increase over the last decade. \"I think they’re more popular than ever,\" he told me recently. He doesn’t call for outlawing them, partly because he doesn’t consider that feasible, given First Amendment freedom-of-assembly protections. But he hardly considers Greek life ideal. \"If we could create higher education from scratch, would we have organizations that divide people by race, class and gender at institutions that are supposed to be encouraging diversity?\" he asked. His answer was immediate and emphatic: \"No.\" Obviously, that’s not all that fraternities and sororities do. Many are vigorously engaged in charitable work and community service. They provide a social mooring that students find helpful. There’s some evidence that students in fraternities maintain higher-than-average grades, and the Gallup-Purdue Index, a far-reaching survey of American college graduates, found that those who belonged to fraternities and sororities reported more career and life satisfaction later on than those who didn’t.   But, as Hechinger noted, fraternities segregate. They discriminate. They concentrate and enshrine privilege at a time when we’re ostensibly trying to be more mindful of that. In so doing they reveal the hollowness of many of our vows. We profess outrage about sexual assault and abuse, the dimensions of which have been rendered even clearer by the galling revelations of the last month and a half. Still we indulge fraternities, which abet that behavior. Persuasive research — along with common sense — tells us that members of all-male fraternities are more likely to have a warped view of permissible sexual contact and that women who frequent fraternity parties are more likely to be assaulted. Additionally, the binge drinking so prevalent at fraternities is the enemy of informed consent. \"We need to be cautious about broad-brush generalizations,\" Alexander McCormick, an Indiana University professor who is the director of the National Survey of Student Engagement, said to me in an email. But, he conceded, some fraternities are guilty of \"encouraging and rewarding sexual conquest that condones or normalizes sexual assault.\" We profess alarm over how partisan American politics is, how fractured our culture has become, and how viciously tribal our interactions can be. In light of that, we resolve to assemble more heterogeneous campuses. But then we blithely watch and even celebrate the retreat of students into fraternities and sororities, which are in many cases largely homogeneous enclaves antithetical to the broadening of perspective and challenging of ingrained assumptions that higher education should be all about. We say that we’ll press fraternities to be responsible, and they in turn promise to obey. But there’s spotty follow-through. Penn State in 2004 trumpeted a program called Greek Pride: A Return to Glory. Beta Theta Pi, where the pledge with the lacerated spleen languished, was described as a model fraternity at the school, with strict rules governing alcohol consumption. I’m sure that’s enormous consolation to the grieving parents of that pledge, Timothy Piazza. \"These fraternities have drink, danger and debauchery in their blood — right alongside secrecy and self-protection,\" Lisa Wade, an Occidental College sociology professor and the author of \"American Hookup: The New Culture of Sex on Campus,\" wrote in a Time magazine essay that called for an end to fraternities. \"They cannot reform.\" Shy of abolishing them, colleges could at least stop promoting and even romanticizing them. Hechinger said that campus websites and tours have presented gauzy propaganda extolling Greek life. Why not provide detailed information about individual fraternities’ disciplinary records instead? And why not put more energy into nurturing other groups and living arrangements that might siphon students away from fraternities? Wade began her Time essay by observing that 150 years ago, fraternities were regarded with enormous suspicion by many college presidents, who described them as \"un-American,\" a \"plague\" and a force for \"greater unkindness and ill feeling than almost anything else in college.\" And college presidents today? When I spoke with Wade, she told me that they might not be champions of fraternities if they weren’t already stuck with them. \"Imagine a world,\" she said, \"in which everything was the same about higher education except there have never been Greek organizations. An 18-year-old waltzes into a dean’s office and says, ‘I want to start an exclusive club on campus that doesn’t allow women and serves mostly white and privileged students and we’re going to throw parties all the time that are illegal, and at these parties, all the bad stuff that happens on campus is going to happen disproportionately. What do you think?’ \" Wade’s hypothetical 18-year-old leaves out the part where undertakers cart the casualties away. Even so I think the dean turns his proposal down.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/opinion/pledges-fraternities-violence-deaths.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'world': [{'title': 'In Rio de Janeiro, ‘Complete Vulnerability’ as Violence Surges', 'text': ' RIO DE JANEIRO — For teachers in this seaside megacity, Rio de Janeiro’s surge in violence has meant making a life-or-death judgment call with unnerving frequency: deciding whether to cancel classes because of nearby shootouts. For police officers, it has meant burying 119 of their own so far this year and surrendering ever more territory to drug gangs that have resumed open-air sales in teeming communities that had been declared \"pacified\" just a few years ago. Many ordinary residents of this city of about 6.5 million start the day scanning mobile apps that track live reports of gunfire before planning their commutes. A little more than a year since Rio de Janeiro hosted a largely successful Summer Olympics, Brazil’s showcase city is plagued by a rise in lawlessness reminiscent of its darkest periods in the 1980s and 1990s. There were 4,974 people killed in Rio de Janeiro State, with a population of about 16.5 million, during the first nine months of this year, up 11 percent from last year, according to state government statistics. The rise in violent crime here is part of a nationwide trend that experts say has been exacerbated by Brazil’s economic recession, by corruption that has hollowed out government coffers and by fierce competition among drug trafficking organizations. Last year, there were 61,619 people killed across Brazil, according to data compiled by Brazilian Forum on Public Security, making it the deadliest year on record. Facing a budget deficit and increasingly well-armed and organized drug cartels, officials in Rio de Janeiro have turned to the federal government for a bailout and to the military for backup. \"The situation is one of complete vulnerability,\" said Antônio Carlos Costa, the head of Rio de Paz, an organization that supports victims of violence. \"The weapons used by the traffickers are weapons of war.\" The resurgence of violence comes after what had been tangible, but short-lived gains in reducing the city’s crime. In 2008, when Brazil was preparing to host the 2014 World Cup, and was bidding for the 2016 Olympics, government officials launched an ambitious plan to secure the city’s favelas, a patchwork of unplanned hillside communities that had long been neglected by the government. A system of community policing was established and law enforcement officers were rewarded when they met crime reduction targets. It amounted to a counterinsurgency strategy. So-called Pacification Police Units established in the favelas were envisioned as the first step to bringing state services to the areas. A steady police presence was supposed to root out the organized crime networks that had become the de facto authority in the favelas, and then the plan called for gradually expanding access to decent sanitation, health care and education to the historically marginalized communities. For a few years, the plan appeared to get traction. From a peak of 65 violent deaths per 100,000 Rio de Janeiro State residents in 1994, the rate dropped to 29 in 2012. A $10.7 billion investment in infrastructure before the 2016 Games brought hope that the Olympics would serve as a catalyst to reduce inequality in a city where exorbitant wealth and destitution had long coexisted in stark contrast. The main reason that didn’t happen can be summed up in one word, according to Monica de Bolle, an expert on Brazil at the Peterson Institute for International Economics: Corruption. \"To the extent that you were reclaiming territories of the favelas from drug traffickers, you needed to create jobs,\" Ms. de Bolle added. \"There was an expectation that there was going to be a massive investment in social projects in the favelas, and then the money ran out completely.\" The state-run oil giant Petrobras, based in Rio de Janeiro and one of the city’s economic engines, was crippled by the disclosure of an enormous kickback scheme in 2014. That scandal unfolded as the global price of oil fell precipitously. Simultaneously, according to federal prosecutors, state officials, including the former state governor Sérgio Cabral, turned  spending on the Olympics into an exercise in fraud that allowed senior government officials and businessmen to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars from the public treasury. While the Olympics led to durable gains for Rio de Janeiro — most notably by upgrading its public transportation system — missed opportunities are evident in virtually every part of the city. The C.E. Clóvis Monteiro high school in Jacarezinho, in northern Rio de Janeiro, bears a \"Rio 2016\" plaque with the Olympic logo that says \"Education transforms.\" But ask the principal, Andreia Queiroz, about the area’s recent transformation, and you get a tour of bullet holes in her building, including one that shattered a classroom window. This year, Ms. Queiroz has often started her morning before dawn scanning reports about gun battles, relying on a series of group chats she monitors on WhatsApp. Deciding when to shut down the school is more art than science, a grim ritual she and other educators across the city have become accustomed to. Through late October, there had been only 11 days this year in which at least one school in the city was not shut down as a result of violence, according to Rio de Janeiro’s municipal education system. That has meant that more than 161,000 students have had their studies interrupted by clashes. Ms. Queiroz said the breakdown of security and the economic downturn had led as many as 400 of the 1,500 students enrolled in her school to stop coming to class regularly this year. \"Here we have some students providing for their families,\" she said. The ones who continue to come are often jumpy, she added. \"I see their difficulty in concentrating,\" she added. \"They are here, but their head is always outside.\" A scan of the school’s walls reveals hints of the violence raging outside — and the manner in which it is shaping national politics. The letters CV — the acronym of Comando Vermelho, or Red Command — and the words \"Fora Bolsonaro,\" or Be Gone, Bolsonaro, are scrawled all over the walls. The first is a sign of allegiance to the powerful gang that has been the de facto authority in several pockets of Rio de Janeiro for decades. The second is a repudiation of a far-right congressman, Jair Bolsonaro — currently polling second in next year’s presidential contest — who has vowed to empower security forces to kill more of what he calls \"bandits.\" The front lines for the type of crackdown Mr. Bolsonaro has promised are forming in the neighborhood outside the school. On a recent afternoon, young men armed with rifles stood at the entry points of a sector of Jacarezinho controlled by drug traffickers. Schoolchildren walked home zigzagging through clogged, narrow streets, where produce stands share sidewalk space with tables where sellers hawked small bags of cocaine and marijuana. Several walls in the community are spattered with deep holes from blasts of ammunition sprayed by machine guns. \"We’re in the crossfire,\" said Maria, a 63-year-old woman who does nails at a tiny salon with bare light bulbs and declined to provide her last name because of security concerns. \"I’ve lost lots of business.\" A poll conducted by the research firm Datafolha in early October found that 72 percent of Rio de Janeiro residents would move to a safer city if they could. The survey, which included 812 respondents and had a four percentage point margin of error, found that fewer than one in 10 people felt the military police, the main entity responsible for security, were efficient at preventing crime. Ordinary residents here speak with similar despondence about the police and the drug gangs. Ana Paula Oliveira, a community activist whose 19-year-old son was killed by the police in 2014, said residents of low-income communities feel besieged every time the police crack down temporarily, only to ultimately fade away and allow areas to fall back under the control of traffickers. Between January and September, at least 800 of the people killed in the state were shot by police officers. \"They come to us with a discourse that there is a war,\" she said. \"But this is not a war. It’s a massacre of poor people living in favelas. In order to ensure that the elite enjoys security, it’s necessary to kill the poor people.\" Upscale parts of Rio de Janeiro, including the tourist hubs like Copacabana and Ipanema, feel like a world apart, thanks to a robust police presence. But they have not been spared by the rise in crime. And the violence has taken a steep toll on the tourism industry. The city lost approximately $200 million in tourism revenue between January and August, according to the National Federation of Commerce, Goods, Services and Tourism. Two tourists have been shot so far this year in the city, including a Spanish woman who was killed by a policeman last month while she was touring a favela. While security in Brazil has historically been a state and municipal government responsibility, the federal government in recent months has deployed hundreds of soldiers to contain outbursts of violence in Rio de Janeiro. In a sign that the military is bracing for a prolonged role here, it successfully lobbied Congress last month to pass a law allowing soldiers who commit crimes against civilians during operations to be tried in military tribunals, rather than civilian courts. Roberto Sá, the secretary of security for Rio de Janeiro State, said in response to emailed questions that the \"financial calamity\" that had afflicted the state over the last year and a half had made it impossible to implement a comprehensive security policy. \"To put it in practice,\" Mr. Sá said, \"we need financial resources that the state does not have at its disposal.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/world/americas/rio-de-janeiro-brazil-violent-crime-security.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Lebanese Prime Minister Meets Macron After Mysterious Saudi Stay', 'text': ' PARIS — Lebanon’s absent prime minister arrived in France on Saturday morning after two weeks in Saudi Arabia, a mysterious stay that touched off intense speculation that he was being held against his will. The prime minister, Saad Hariri, who has not publicly explained the nature of his stay in Saudi Arabia, met with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for lunch at the Élysée Palace and confirmed that he would travel to Beirut later in the week. The meeting with Mr. Macron came hours after a phone call between Mr. Macron and the Lebanese president, Michel Aoun, the French president’s office said. Officials said that Mr. Aoun had thanked Mr. Macron for \"France’s actions in favor of Lebanon\" and confirmed that Mr. Hariri would be in Beirut for Lebanon’s Independence Day holiday, which is Wednesday. Mr. Hariri later said in statements to the news media that he would announce his position on the crisis in his country after holding talks with Mr. Aoun. \"As you know, I have resigned and we will speak about this matter there,\" Mr. Hariri told reporters, referring to Lebanon, as he was leaving the Élysée Palace, where he met with Mr. Macron for over 30 minutes, before gathering for lunch with his wife, their oldest son and Mr. Macron’s wife. After the meeting, officials in the French president’s office announced that Mr. Macron was considering gathering in Paris the members of the United Nations International Support Group for Lebanon, although no specific date was given. French officials refused to say whether Mr. Hariri had explained to Mr. Macron the reason for his mysterious stay in Saudi Arabia or the circumstances around the announcement of his resignation. Mr. Hariri’s office said earlier on Saturday that his wife, Lara, and their son Houssam would be present at the lunch in the Lebanese prime minister’s honor at the Élysée Palace. Mr. Hariri’s wife had accompanied him on the flight from Saudi Arabia, and his son was said to have flown in from Britain. Mr. Hariri’s two younger children, a 16-year-old daughter, Loulwa, and a 12-year-old son, Abdulaziz, did not appear in television footage of his arrival. The two have been attending school in Saudi Arabia and could have stayed behind for that reason, but their apparent absence was an obstacle to ending concerns that Mr. Hariri was not acting freely. It left room for speculation that the Saudis had pressured Mr. Hariri to leave them in the country as leverage. Mr. Hariri announced on Nov. 4 from Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that he was stepping down as Lebanon’s prime minister, but officials in Lebanon have said that his departure would not take effect until he delivered his resignation in person in Beirut. Mr. Hariri’s unexpected trip and resignation unsettled the Middle East, setting off a political crisis in Lebanon and even raising fears of war. Saudi Arabia was widely seen as pressuring Mr. Hariri to resign as part of its escalating regional feud with Iran and its effort to isolate Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia and political party that is part of Mr. Hariri’s coalition government. Mr. Hariri said he feared for his safety in Lebanon. With European diplomats scrambling to defuse the crisis, France seized the role of mediator. Mr. Macron made a surprise visit to Riyadh on Nov. 9. A week later, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, met Mr. Hariri in the Saudi capital. Mr. Macron’s deputy adviser on diplomacy also traveled from Paris to Lebanon during the crisis, while Mr. Macron was having \"direct and frequent\" contacts with leaders in the region, including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, according to officials in the French president’s office. France has strong ties to Lebanon, where it was a former colonial ruler, and to the Hariri family. \"It’s an occasion for France to show that it can be an intermediary and have a role in the crises of the Middle East,\" Rima Tarabay, an adviser on European affairs for Mr. Hariri, said in a phone interview. But Ms. Tarabay added that the crisis went beyond Mr. Hariri’s announced resignation, which has plunged the political situation of Lebanon in uncertainty. \"We are facing a very complex situation, not specifically tied to Saad’s personal issue, but regarding what is going to happen next,\" Ms. Tarabay said, raising concerns about the potential \"resurgence of violence in the region, and a war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\" At a European Union summit meeting on Friday, Mr. Macron told journalists that France did not want to choose sides in the Middle East, adding that \"the role of France is to talk to everyone.\" However, he urged Iran to pursue a \"less aggressive regional strategy.\" On Saturday, Mr. Hariri met at his residence in France with two of his closest advisers, Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk and Nader Hariri, a senior aide. Many of the prime minister’s most trusted advisers had been out of touch or only in rare contact with him during his Saudi stay. At 1:10 a.m. on Saturday in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Hariri wrote on Twitter that he was \"on the way to the airport.\" His tweet mentioned Sigmar Gabriel, the foreign minister of Germany, who had asked whether the Saudis were holding Mr. Hariri. Saudi Arabia later said on Saturday that it would formally protest Mr. Gabriel’s remarks and that it would recall its ambassador to Germany. Mr. Hariri had arrived in Riyadh just as Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, put many of the country’s most wealthy and powerful men, including some members of the royal family, under de facto arrest in what has been described as an anti-corruption sweep. His visit also came as the Saudis accused Iran-backed rebels in Yemen of firing a missile at Riyadh. It was not clear if Mr. Hariri’s trip was related to these events. In Lebanon, many questions remain, including whether Mr. Hariri will hand in his resignation or rescind it, and whether the government will be reorganized. \"The crisis of the resignation and Hariri’s return is now finished, but a political crisis has just begun,\" Lebanon’s Parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, said on Friday after news emerged that Mr. Hariri would fly to Paris. Regardless of his next moves, Mr. Hariri will remain beholden to Saudi Arabia. His personal and family finances are deeply entwined with the country, which has also backed his party’s extensive political patronage network and media outlets. But the Saudi gambit to get him to take a more confrontational approach against Iran and Hezbollah could backfire. Mr. Hariri could end up presiding over a caretaker government ahead of elections planned for next year. Analysts and diplomats said that Saudi Arabia was likely to gain little more than a renewed rhetorical commitment from all sides to Lebanese neutrality. Tension had been building during the year since Mr. Hariri formed a national unity government in a deal that brought Mr. Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, to the presidency. Hezbollah gained new power and weaponry while helping President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, another Iran ally, beat back insurgents. Mr. Aoun began signaling plans to normalize relations with the Syrian government, with members of his party even meeting with Syrian diplomats in New York during the annual General Assembly gatherings. That was too much for some of Mr. Hariri’s allies and supporters, and for Riyadh. Mr. Hariri reached out to Jordan with a request to go to Amman as a safe haven, a Western official said. The request was denied, the official said, because the Saudis had pressured Jordan not to accept him. A spokeswoman at the Embassy of Jordan in Washington denied that such a request had been made. Assessing what Mr. Hariri’s stay in France would mean for the crisis in Lebanon going forward, an official in the French president’s office said the move had likely contributed to easing the current tensions but was unlikely, he added, to bring them to any definitive conclusion.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/world/middleeast/hariri-france-saudi-lebanon.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'As Mexico Builds Green Airport of the Future, Age-Old Mistakes Loom', 'text': ' CHIMALHUACÁN, Mexico — On the flat salt basin that was once the Aztecs’ great Lake Texcoco, Mexico is building its \"door to the world,\" an enormous airport the government vows will exist in harmony with the environment. Officials described a terminal design so green that it would be a \"global reference\" for sustainability, and they pledged to rescue degraded lands surrounding the airport. But soon after construction started in 2015, the government appeared to turn its back on part of that promise, ceding land designated on project maps for conservation to local officials for development. And as construction moves ahead on Mexico’s grandest infrastructure project in decades, the much-heralded environmental protection effort is still so devoid of detail, critics say, that it raises questions of credibility and actually obscures the risk of flooding. Centuries-old mistakes concerning land and water management are likely to be repeated as a result, said Fernando Córdova Tapia, an analyst at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who led a group of scientists that examined the government’s initial environmental impact statement. Handing over the land that had been earmarked for conservation, about 500 acres, was \"the first symptom of how they are betraying the entire environmental mitigation effort,\" Mr. Córdova said. President Enrique Peña Nieto’s office defended the plans, saying in a statement that the project was \"designed to improve the ecological health of the region and provide an integrated rescue of a zone that was environmentally degraded.\" The government’s plan calls for a network of channels, tunnels and five new reservoirs to collect runoff that drains into the area. Octavio Mayén Mena, a spokesman for the government agency managing the project, said reforestation is underway, and the National Water Commission said construction of the reservoirs will begin next year. Still, the federal government has yet to present detailed environmental plans for the airport’s hotel and shopping areas, and for conservation and land use on the approximately 27 square miles surrounding the new transportation hub. The study by Mr. Córdova’s group warned that salt cedar, the main species in the reforesting effort, is not native to Mexico and is so invasive that it could damage the entire ecosystem. The airport reflects Mr. Peña Nieto’s aspirations of turning Mexico City into a travel hub for the Americas, and, as he enters his final year in office, it is also part of his effort to establish a legacy. The president, who is not eligible for re-election and is deeply unpopular, has been forced to cancel other big-ticket infrastructure projects over corruption scandals and budget cuts. Evoking the monumentality of Mexican architecture, the British architect Norman Foster has designed a soaring steel and glass airport terminal, the heart of the $13 billion first phase of the project, which is scheduled to open in 2020 and serve 50 million passengers a year. The new airport, which the government hopes will meet the highest international certification for green buildings, will relieve congestion at the capital’s Benito Juárez International Airport. For more than two decades, successive governments have looked for a place to build the airport, and Mr. Peña Nieto appeared determined to avoid conflict this time. Land struggles had scuttled an airport project to the northeast 15 years ago, and the lake bed — which is mostly federal land — seemed to offer an easier path. But the site presents unique challenges. Lake Texcoco, where the Aztecs built their island capital, Tenochtitlán, once captured the rainwater hurtling down the surrounding hillsides. Eventually, the Aztecs expanded the ancient capital with landfill and planted crops on floating gardens called chinampas, plots of fertile arable soil on the shallow lake beds of the Valley of Mexico. But Spanish conquerors  drained the lake and cleared forestland, setting off centuries of flooding and water-management crises. With no natural source of water to filter back into the aquifer below, the lake bed itself is sinking. \"We inherited the war the Spanish waged against water and therefore the lack of wisdom on how to coexist with it in a sustainable manner,\" Mr. Córdova said. Last year, eager to head off any local opposition, the federal government transferred 500 acres wedged between two of the planned reservoirs to the city government of Chimalhuacán, which is controlled by a social movement called Antorcha Campesina, or Peasant Torch. The local group has a symbiotic relationship with Mr. Peña Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, delivering votes at election time and acting, often aggressively, as a ground operation for the party, said Neptalí Monterroso, a professor of political science at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico. The Chimalhuacán authorities wasted no time putting the land to use. A polytechnic university is rising, and soccer fields for a sports center have been marked out. An industrial park is on the drawing boards. \"We’re talking about taking many people out of poverty,\" said Cecilia Hernández Anaya, a spokeswoman for the Chimalhuacán government. Mexico’s National Water Commission approved the transfer of the 500 acres. Though project maps show the land had been designated for habitat conservation and flood management, the commission, responding to questions from The New York Times, said that the area had never been included in the original flood control project. The water commission’s former director called the land transfer \"outrageous\" and said the area had indeed been assigned to the reservoir system. \"You can’t build anything there; there is a very high risk,\" said the former director, José Luis Luege, a member of the opposition National Action Party. Senator Víctor Hermosillo, also of the National Action Party, has asked for an investigation by the federal comptroller, noting that the land had been handed over with no impact studies. \"That suggests a gift, a handout with a highly political electoral purpose,\" he and four other senators said in a resolution in June. Despite the land transfer, the politics of the poor towns surrounding the airport zone, especially Chimalhuacán, a city of low-slung concrete houses straddling the hillsides above the lake bed, are unpredictable. Ceding the land to the local government may have warded off conflict at one level, but it has not guaranteed peace. Some 230 families that claim to be the original landowners of the plot that now belongs to Chimalhuacán and the reservoir sites on either side argue that they have been cheated out of just compensation. Bearing copperplate land titles handed down over generations, they have staged protests, accosted politicians and sought out the news media. To buttress their claim, they unroll copies of maps dating to the 1930s that show named rows of narrow plots. In May, the families reached agreement with the federal government for compensation, said Juan Loreto González, a leader of the group. But a deadline came and went, and the families have yet to see their money. They are threatening new protests. \"Chimalhuacán has always been seen as plunder,\" said Cruz Hernández, who at 65, is old enough to have fished in the remnants of Lake Texcoco. \"The land has been stripped. Now we stand ready to fight.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/world/americas/mexico-city-airport-enrique-pena-nieto.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'At Bonn Climate Talks, Stakes Get Higher in Gamble on Planet’s Future', 'text': ' Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter. BONN, Germany — Perhaps the most revealing moment at this year’s United Nations climate talks came on Wednesday, when Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany addressed the nearly 200 nations gathered here. After declaring that \"climate change is an issue determining our destiny as mankind,\" Ms. Merkel acknowledged that Germany was likely to miss the goals it had set itself for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 because of its continued reliance on coal power. While vowing to grapple with the issue, she said that phasing out coal use would require \"tough discussions\" with German policymakers in the weeks ahead. On one level, it was a stark reminder that the real action on global warming does not unfold in international venues. The problem will largely be addressed by governments back home trying to adopt policies to shift away from fossil fuels, by businesses perfecting and deploying clean energy technologies, by city planners reworking their local transportation systems. But Ms. Merkel’s speech was an example of what diplomats are trying to achieve. As the two-week Bonn talks concluded on Saturday, negotiators said they had made headway on creating a formal process under the 2015 Paris agreement in which world leaders would regularly and publicly detail the efforts they are making to address climate change, pinpoint areas where they are falling short, and push each other to do more. It is, in effect, a giant bet on the power of peer pressure — with the future of the planet at stake. And no one yet knows how that bet will pan out. The Trump administration’s  vow to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement by 2020 has made that peer pressure dynamic more complicated. While State Department officials still attended this year’s talks and helped shape rules around how countries will report their progress on emissions, the world’s richest nation is no longer seeking to lead the fight against climate change. Virtually everyone at the Bonn conference acknowledged that the world’s nations are still failing to prevent drastic global warming in the decades ahead. \"We need more action, more ambition, and we need it now,\" said Patricia Espinosa, the United Nations climate chief. Under the Paris agreement, nearly every country submitted a voluntary pledge for constraining its emissions. Yet those pledges are modest: even with them, the world is still on course to warm at least 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) this century, an outcome that carries far greater risks of destabilizing ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, drastic sea-level rise and more extreme heat waves and droughts. So, at Bonn, diplomats focused on ways to encourage countries to ratchet up their ambitions. Next year, world leaders will meet for a formal dialogue to assess how their efforts stack up against the goal of limiting global warming to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius. They plan to discuss which domestic climate policies are working and which ones aren’t, and then try to figure out which countries can step up the pace of their emissions cuts. Ultimately, countries plan to submit newer, stronger climate pledges to the United Nations by 2020. Negotiators sought this year to write a \"rule book\" that will govern this process, laying out guidelines for how emissions from each country should be measured or how financial aid from rich countries to poor ones should be tracked. Most of the hard decisions about what this rule book should look like were put off until next year. The biggest unknown is whether this whole process will translate into meaningful further action to cut emissions. At Bonn, there were a few signs peer pressure is working and that some countries are indeed feeling compelled to take stronger action. Leaders from the European Union, which is currently on pace to fall short of its 2030 emissions goals, said they would push to enact new legislation on increasing clean energy and efficiency. \"The level of ambition from the European Union has been questioned,\" said Miguel Arias Cañete, Europe’s commissioner for climate change. \"We understand the concerns.\" And elsewhere, longstanding divisions among nations reasserted themselves. Throughout the talks, China argued that the Paris agreement rule book should hold developed nations to higher standards than developing countries. In past climate talks, the United States had taken the lead in pushing back against this notion, but with the Trump administration stepping back from the Paris agreement, American influence in this area was weaker. These disagreements may only be partly resolved at future climate talks. Andrew Deutz, an expert on international negotiations at the Nature Conservancy, argued that one of the most important climate developments of the year actually happened outside of the Bonn meeting — when the Chinese government announced that it would expand its domestic market for electric vehicles to seven million cars by 2025, a move spurred in part by Chinese concerns over air pollution in cities. Experts say national climate policies will be shaped far more by domestic considerations than by international pressure. But, Mr. Deutz added, these talks can be useful for \"creating a forum where everyone has confidence in what everyone else is doing. That sort of mutual confidence can be enabling.\" Still, there is the question of pace. During the second week of talks, climate scientists gave a presentation to the conference on the vast task ahead of them. To stay below 2 degrees Celsius of warming, global emissions would likely have to peak in the next few years and then be cut by half every decade all the way down to zero by midcentury. The scale of that transition is staggering. Virtually every coal plant around the world would need to be phased out or outfitted with carbon capture technology within decades. Electric vehicles would need to be the primary mode of transportation, and the world’s power grids would need to be virtually emissions-free. Technology that barely exists today to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere may need to be deployed on a huge scale. That presentation came on the heels of a news conference by a different set of scientists, who announced that current industrial emissions of greenhouse gases have not yet peaked — instead, they are likely to rise again in 2017, driven in part by a rebound in coal use in China.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/climate/un-bonn-climate-talks.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Afghan Army Recruitment Dwindles as Taliban Threaten Families', 'text': ' KUNDUZ, Afghanistan — Rahimullah served in the Afghan Army for two years, deployed to the bloody front lines of the southern province of Helmand. When he quit, it was not because of the combat: It was when the Taliban went after his family back home, telling them that if he didn’t leave the army there would be a fine of one Kalashnikov rifle, seven cartridge magazines and $1,000 — or worse. \"My father called me to say the Taliban are demanding this,\" said Mr. Rahimullah, 30, who now lives back in the eastern province of Kunar with his family. \"I left the army, and some other of my friends left, too. We didn’t have the money to pay them. We had joined the army from poverty.\" Such demands are another way that the Taliban have been able to keep pressure on the Afghan Army, which was already struggling with record casualties and attrition. As the insurgents have made inroads in eastern and northern Afghanistan — long the most important recruiting grounds for the army — they are directly threatening the military’s ability to replenish its dwindling ranks. Interviews with residents and army recruitment officers across several provinces suggest the Taliban pressure is taking a serious toll, with officials in some provinces reporting recruitment down by as much as 50 percent. Exact data on Afghan forces has been classified by both the Afghan government and the United States, which largely bankrolls the security forces. Senior officials in Kabul, the capital, admitted to a partial drop in recruitment this year, but said they were hoping to intensify efforts and make up the loss by the end of the year. Gen. Mohammed Ibrahim, the commander of the Afghan Army’s national recruitment center, said the force had recruited 37,000 men last year, and 42,000 in 2015. \"In the first six months of this year, we recruited 13,000 personnel, but we are planning to recruit 25,000 in the second six months,\" he said. \"We do face challenges in recruiting enough personnel, I cannot hide that.\" The general attributed the recruitment woes as much to the increasing violence as to a decrease in funding for outreach efforts, such as television advertisements. \"We used to gather about 350 or 400 people a month, now it’s about 150 a month,\" said Abdul Qadeer, head of army recruitment in Kunduz Province, where the Taliban have twice seized the center of the provincial capital in recent years. \"All the districts outside the city are under enemy influence, and they threaten the youth into not joining the army.\" Taliban pressure includes fines on families of soldiers, physical punishment of soldiers who return home, and even confiscation of land and homes. \"The Taliban tell the father of an army soldier to either call back your son, or give us a Kalashnikov rifle and 400,000 afghanis,\" said Mujtaba Khan, head of army recruitment in Badakhshan Province, referring to a fine of about $6,000. \"And when the son returns, he is beaten and locked up.\" Other officials said that the rising number of army casualties in gruesome, high-profile attacks over the past year was also affecting recruitment. In one recent massacre in Kandahar Province, the Taliban nearly wiped out an entire army unit of 60 men. In April, insurgents drove into the army’s headquarters in the northern province of Balkh and killed at least 140 soldiers in a rampage that lasted several hours. In a March attack claimed by the Islamic State, militants barged into the military’s main hospital in Kabul, slaughtering dozens of soldiers who were being treated there. While the Afghan government does not publicly disclose exact casualty figures, the coffins are still coming home to villages. In private, officials say on average 20 to 30 Afghan soldiers and police officers die every day as the violence intensifies. \"Before the attack on army corps in the north and the military hospital in Kabul our numbers were higher, but now recruitment is down,\" said Abdul Maroof, in charge of army recruitment in Takhar Province. \"Compared with previous years, I would say our recruitment is at about 50 percent less.\" When the new Afghan Army took its initial strides at the peak of the international presence, with the American-led NATO coalition of tens of thousands of soldiers and marines leading the way, most of the heavy fighting was concentrated in the south and parts of the southeast. The soldiers, however, largely came from the north, where jobs were few and the agricultural base was not enough to feed large families. In recent years, the fighting has spread to the north and northeast of the country, even as the war in the south has intensified. Afghan forces lead the fight, with American help mostly limited to air support, training and advising. The drop in recruitment is a major blow to a force that is suffering from drastic losses of men and territory. Some of the units struggled so much, losing men and equipment, that they had to be entirely rebuilt. The fighting has also laid bare the leadership woes of the Afghan forces, with many officers proving corrupt or inadequate to the new ways of fighting. The Afghan Army is rolling out a program to retire hundreds of old generals and colonels clogging the top, in the hopes of promoting a new generation of commanders. While many families relent under Taliban pressure and call their children back from the army, others resist — and pay the price. Soon after the Taliban made major gains in Kunduz Province, they came for the Parwan family. The family lived on the outskirts of the city of Kunduz, and two of their sons were serving in the Afghan Army. \"They told us, ‘Either call your brothers and pull them out of the army, or we will take over your land,’\" said Arash Parwan, 23. The family relied on the combined salaries of the soldiers, and they made a calculation that farming the land alone could not sustain them. So they resisted the Taliban, instead deciding to flee to the city center. \"The Taliban took over our land and two houses,\" Mr. Parwan said. \"They toppled one of the houses, and turned the other into their base.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-army-recruitment.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'China Envoy Discusses ‘Situation of the Korean Peninsula’ With North', 'text': ' SEOUL, South Korea — A special envoy from President Xi Jinping of China discussed regional and mutual concerns with senior North Korean officials in Pyongyang on Saturday, the North’s state media said. The trip by the special envoy, Song Tao, to the North Korean capital came as the Trump administration pressed Mr. Xi to help restrain North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs by exerting China’s economic leverage over its impoverished neighbor. \"The two sides exchanged their views on such matters of mutual concern as the situation of the Korean Peninsula and region and bilateral relations,\" the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said, without offering further details on Mr. Song’s discussions with Ri Su-yong, a top North Korean foreign relations official. During his visit, Mr. Song was widely expected to try to ease the standoff over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs. Relations between the two neighboring communist countries have shown signs of fraying in recent years as North Korea stepped up its missile and nuclear tests, and China supported American-led efforts to impose increasingly tougher sanctions against the North. President Trump met with Mr. Xi in Beijing last week and called on China to do more to rein in its neighbor. He later expressed his expectation for the sending of the Chinese envoy by tweeting: \"A big move, we’ll see what happens!\" North Korea has not conducted any missile tests since Sept. 15, raising cautious hopes in the region that the country might be ready to ease tensions. But gaps remain wide between the United States and North Korea, limiting Beijing’s ability to broker a compromise, analysts said.

The de-escalation zones encompass most of the remaining areas of Syria still held by insurgent groups, not including the Islamic State. Under the agreement, the combatants are to refrain from new attacks, except against hard-line groups that have not signed on to the pact. Longstanding sieges are to be lifted to allow free movement of goods and people. But siege and bombardment tactics, mostly by the Syrian government against rebel-held areas, have continued despite the Astana accord, named for the Kazakh capital, where it was struck. The recent uptick in attacks — and the lack of any outcry from international sponsors of the Astana deal — has bolstered skepticism from opponents of the Syrian government who doubted the deal’s good faith from the start. This month, after a meeting in Da Nang, Vietnam, President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia issued a joint statement affirming the \"importance of de-escalation areas as an interim step to reduce violence in Syria.\" But days later, on Monday, airstrikes hit a marketplace in the rebel-held town of Atarib, which is in a de-escalation zone in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo. The marketplace was \"completely destroyed,\" said Ali Obeid, a witness who broadcast the aftermath on social media. His video and others showed desperation, suffering and bewilderment. In one, a man paused next to someone he apparently recognized, whose head had been blown off. \"God give your soul peace,\" the man said. In another scene, a man called for help from the floor of a destroyed shop. He had lost a leg. The attack came on the same day that Amnesty International issued a report condemning de-escalation zone violations and what it called the collective punishment of civilian populations in rebel-held areas. Attacks in Atarib and elsewhere \"highlight concerns about these so-called safe zones and whether they are really ever safe,\" Rawya Rageh, a senior adviser to Amnesty who was a co-writer of the report, said in an email. \"Time and again, civilians in Syria are finding no safe place to take refuge.\" With the world’s attention focused on other issues in the Middle East, like the escalating tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran that have set off a political crisis in Lebanon, there has been little official outcry about violations of the de-escalation zones, where many armed and unarmed opponents of President Bashar al-Assad are concentrated. International leaders consider the de-escalation zones a building block as preparations are being made for a new round of United Nations-backed peace talks in Geneva this month between the Syrian government and the main opposition coalition, and for separate Russian-backed talks between Syrian factions in the Russian town of Sochi. Countries that are hosting millions of Syrian refugees, including Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, have cited those talks and the de-escalation agreement as reasons to press for the refugees to return home. The agreement allows for attacks on a hard-line Islamist insurgent group, the Qaeda-linked Levant Liberation Committee. The group is the most powerful one within the de-escalation zone that includes Atarib and the neighboring province of Idlib, dominating more moderate groups calling themselves the Free Syrian Army. But Atarib is not under the control of the Levant Liberation Committee. The town is known for its history of civil and armed resistance against both the Syrian government and hard-line Islamist groups. Its residents helped local rebels expel the Islamic State in 2014, and they drove out the Qaeda-linked Nusra Front — a group that later morphed into the Levant Liberation Committee — after it tried to take over in 2015. To Atarib residents, the attack bolstered a sense that the de-escalation agreement is failing to protect them, and highlighted the dissociation between international diplomacy and local reality. \"It is a norm now that the civilians are being targeted everywhere,\" said Shady al-Mahmoud, an activist from Atarib, \"and the international silence that follows such atrocities has become a norm as well.\" In recent months, airstrikes by the Syrian government or Russia have hit schools, hospitals and homes in Idlib and in the Damascus suburbs of Eastern Ghouta, another de-escalation zone, where the United Nations says 400,000 residents are trapped and where one in four children are at risk of malnutrition. A World Food Program warehouse in Eastern Ghouta was attacked this month. The other de-escalation zones encompass an enclave in Homs Province in central Syria and a stretch of southern Syria that borders Jordan. Further complicating the picture is the Syrian government strategy of forcing the surrender of rebel-held areas and offering people there the choice of returning to government control or being bused to rebel-held Idlib; some 20,000 people displaced that way have ended up in nearby Atarib. \"Tens of thousands of civilians have been forcibly displaced to opposition-held areas in the north under local deals after enduring years of unlawful siege and bombardment,\" Ms. Rageh said. \"They are essentially stuck and exposed as easy marks.\" In the Atarib attack, witnesses said three airstrikes hit the market, leaving little doubt that it was the target. Members of a civil police force that patrols the rebel-held area in the absence of government law enforcement were also killed. Last month, Turkey established observation posts around Idlib Province under the de-escalation deal, including one just 15 miles north of Atarib. But Turkey has made no statement about the strike. A local group that tracks warplanes spotted Russian ones nearby at the time of the attack, but Russia has provided no information. In its report, Amnesty International asserted that the de-escalation deal had been used, in essence, for \"the government to reclaim control of territory by first starving and then removing inhabitants who rejected its rule.\" Syria’s government has signaled reservations about the premise of the de-escalation deal. Ali Haidar, the minister of reconciliation, said in an interview with Syrian state media that failure of the agreement would put all other options back on the table — including military force. \"The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of Syria,\" he said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/world/middleeast/syria-de-escalation-zones-atarib.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Signals Detected From Missing Argentine Submarine as Foreign Navies Join Search', 'text': ' BUENOS AIRES — Argentina’s Defense Ministry said Saturday night that it had detected seven communication attempts throughout the day from an Argentine Navy submarine with 44 crew members aboard that has been missing since Wednesday. \"We received seven signals from satellite calls that originated from the San Juan submarine,\" the defense minister, Oscar Aguad, wrote on Twitter. \"We are working hard to locate it and we are transmitting hope to the families of the 44 crew members: that they’ll soon be able to have them in their homes.\" The Defense Ministry said it was working with an American company that specializes in satellite communication to determine the exact location of the signals. \"This changes everything,\" said Fernando Morales, a navy expert and vice president of the Argentine Navy League. \"It’s a very hopeful sign because it suggests at least several crew members are alive.\" In order to carry out the communications attempt, the submarine had to be close enough to the surface of the water to take out its antenna, Mr. Morales explained. \"It should move along relatively quickly now,\" he said, characterizing the communication attempts as the first optimistic news since reports of the missing submarine began transfixing Argentina on Friday morning. A United States Navy aircraft, a NASA airplane and a British Royal Navy ice patrol ship on Saturday joined the search for the submarine, the ARA San Juan. The search was hindered by strong winds in waters off Argentina’s Patagonia, where the submarine was believed to be stranded, officials said. A day after playing down the severity of the situation, Argentine officials on Saturday signaled growing concern as they welcomed all international assistance. \"Detection has proved to be difficult despite the number of boats and aircraft,\" Capt. Enrique Balbi, a spokesman for the Argentine Navy, said Saturday in a televised interview. \"Waves are of approximately six meters\" — about 20 feet — \"which makes it much more difficult.\" The Argentine Navy is \"accepting all possible or necessary help\" in order to \"not discard any hypothesis,\" Captain Balbi said, noting that search teams had scoured about half of the area where they believed the submarine could be. President Mauricio Macri went on Twitter Friday night to say that his administration was \"committed to using all the national and international resources necessary to find the submarine ARA San Juan as soon as possible.\" Mr. Macri also said his government was in touch with the family members of the crew. \"We share their concern and that of all Argentines,\" he wrote. Pope Francis, who is Argentine, added his \"fervent prayers\" in a telegram on Saturday. The British Navy’s assistance was notable given the war Britain and Argentina fought in 1982 over the Falkland Islands, which Argentina has long claimed as its sovereign territory. Both navies lost vessels, and nearly 1,000 military personnel died in the 10-week conflict. The Protector, a British ice patrol ship, was expected to arrive at the search area from the Falkland Islands on Saturday afternoon, according to the British Embassy in Buenos Aires. In February, the ship was denied permission to dock in Buenos Aires, Argentine news media reported. British officials have also put a C-130 Hercules aircraft stationed in the islands on standby. A United States Navy P-8A Poseidon plane was expected to arrive in Argentina on Saturday night after being diverted from a counternarcotics mission in El Salvador. In a statement, the American military said the plane, the Navy’s newest maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, has \"state-of-the-art sensors and communication equipment, allowing it to support a wide range of missions over large bodies of water, including subsurface search-and-rescue operations.\" A NASA research plane was sent late Thursday to assist in the search, the American Embassy in Buenos Aires said. Chile has sent an aircraft, and Brazil, Uruguay, Peru and South Africa have also offered help. The missing submarine was 240 nautical miles from the coast when it was last tracked. It was traveling from the Patagonian city of Ushuaia to Mar del Plata, in Buenos Aires Province, conducting a routine security patrol. Argentina’s three submarines are usually deployed to combat illegal fishing. The submarine left Ushuaia on Nov. 8 and was scheduled to arrive in Mar del Plata on Sunday, according to the Navy.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/world/americas/argentina-missing-submarine.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Slavery Ensnares Thousands in U.K. Here’s One Teenage Girl’s Story.', 'text': ' LONDON — Every Friday morning, as commuters arrived in London Victoria station, a teenage girl would board a train to Eastbourne, a coastal town about 60 miles outside the city. Dressed in her sports uniform and carrying a shoulder bag covered in badges of pop icons, she tried to give the impression that she was on her way to school. But this teenager was already three hours into her workday. Armed with a knife and carrying a large supply of Class A drugs, the 14-year-old girl had been instructed to travel to Eastbourne to sell crack and heroin. If she failed to meet steadily increasing demands set by her boss at the time, a 48-year-old gang leader who lured her through a social media app, she was either beaten or sexually assaulted. A report by a British government commission on modern slavery and human trafficking, released last month, described a sprawling practice that ensnares tens of thousands of people in Britain. Many are immigrants. But the high number of victims from Britain was an unexpected shock — cases involving British citizens like the teenage girl were the third-largest grouping, after those involving Albanians or Vietnamese. A majority of child-trafficking victims were also found to be British. From nail salons and carwashes to farms and construction sites, thousands of vulnerable adults and children are being traded as commodities and are often subjected to violence and abuse, the report found.  \"We kind of let it slip that we have vulnerable people in our own communities,\" Kevin Hyland, Britain’s first independent antislavery commissioner, said in an interview. \"And they are vulnerable for a number of reasons, not just because they come from poverty. It may be that they have learning difficulties, educational issues or addiction.\" For months, no one noticed as the 14-year-old girl, whose identity is being concealed for her protection because her captors are still at large, sneaked out of her apartment before dawn, skipped school and came home late, once with bruises all over her body. No one saw the deep scratches on her arms and legs when she started to hurt herself. Her mother acknowledged neglecting her daughter at times, occasionally staying away from their home for several nights at a time and ignoring calls from her daughter’s school reporting that she had failed to attend. Then, during the school holidays in July last year, the teenager disappeared. It was not until seven months later, after her mother said she had resigned herself to the fact that her daughter might be dead, that a detective told her that she had been kidnapped and enslaved. \"Enslaved?\" the mother, whose identity is also being concealed to protect her daughter, recalled asking the officer. \"I just kept repeating that word. I didn’t understand it,\" she said in a London park where she often goes to try to manage a panic disorder that developed after her daughter’s disappearance. During the months when her daughter was missing, \"I thought about every possible scenario that could have happened to her,\" her mother said. \"But slavery? I didn’t even know that happened in England.\" Britain recorded 2,255 modern slavery offenses across England and Wales last year, a 159 percent increase from the previous year. According to the government commission, the rise suggests that, while slavery might be increasing, so is awareness among the police and public. The report also said that different agencies were cooperating better. But a recent inspection of police practice found significant deficiencies and inconsistencies that left many victims exposed and vulnerable to further exploitation. \"Victims who come into contact with the police are not always recognized as such and therefore remain in the hands of those who are exploiting them. Others are arrested as offenders or illegal immigrants,\" the British Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services found. Analysts say that some of the most vulnerable people are those who depend on welfare benefits and lack family life and support. As a result, they are easily influenced by people who suddenly appear in their lives. \"People often get picked up when they are hanging around, either at hostels or soup kitchens,\" said Anne Read, an anti-trafficking response coordinator for the Salvation Army, a charity that manages the government support system for adult victims. \"And, of course, now there is the internet, which enables predators to enter people’s homes,\" she added. That is how the teenager met her captor more than a year ago, through a messaging app on her phone. Her mother, who had just lost her job at a bakery, had cut off her weekly allowance of about $26. That caused the girl to spend less time with her friends and more time on the internet. \"I was broke, I couldn’t do nothing,\" the girl, now 15, said in an interview with her caseworker by her side. \"I got bored and started chatting to people on my phone, and that’s how I met him,\" she said, referring to her captor, who has not been taken into custody and whose real name is unknown to investigators. \"He was really sweet when I met him,\" she added with the slight stutter she developed in the months she was away. \"He kept buying me phone credit, and told me he would look after me and teach me how to make money.\" The first day they arranged to meet, he took her to her favorite fish and chip restaurant and ordered the large family menu, just for the two of them. The man was grooming the teenager to \"go country,\" meaning that she would become a drug runner. While most British citizens are trafficked for labor or sex, an increasing number of young people are being drawn into the drug world because of the relatively new phenomenon of distributing narcotics from urban hubs to small towns. \"What we have are criminals who are predators, and who use other people as their instruments of crime,\" Mr. Hyland said. \"They will use them however they can in whatever way they want to make money.\" The teenager’s boss promised her about $175 for every day she worked. The gang he ran made profits of about $2,400 a day, said her caseworker, who requested anonymity because she was not allowed to speak to the news media while the investigation into the teenager’s disappearance was underway. In the first four months of working for the gang, she earned around $2,500 and received a new phone with unlimited data and a gold bracelet, which she still wears. But one day last year, after making a drug run to Eastbourne, she was told by a gang member that the police had caught her on camera and were waiting to arrest her at her home in South London. The teenager believed him. The man, whom she knew as Ziggy, took her phone and money. He then drove her to a dark, squalid garage with no windows, where she lived for the next seven months with various drug addicts. \"Everything changed,\" the girl recalled. \"Ziggy started to beat me and told me I wasn’t worth anything to them anymore.\" She was then taken off the runner rotation and forced into servitude, preparing drug supplies, transferring them between houses in the area and cleaning up after the addicts who lived there. One night, as she slept on a mattress in the corner of the cold garage floor, Ziggy appeared and lay down next to her. \"First he undressed me and made me do things to him, but then he raped me,\" she said, as tears streamed down her face and her hands started shaking. \"I thought about escaping so many times, but I had nowhere to go,\" she said. \"I thought they would either kill me or the police would arrest me.\" When members of the gang and different drug addicts started to rape her every night, she finally decided that nothing could be worse. The next day, she went to a local laundromat and asked to use the phone to call the police. She returned home only after spending several months in a safe house undergoing a rehabilitation program. Her mother has had to move from their former home in South London because members of the gang that abused her daughter are still at large. The teenager’s caseworker said that the biggest challenge was to make sure she completed her recovery process. Otherwise, she could risk falling back into the hands of traffickers, which happens often with young victims. \"I’m really happy to be back with my friends,\" the teenager said, smiling for the first time during a one-hour interview. \"But I really miss having a phone and money.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/world/europe/uk-modern-slavery.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '‘Mugabe Must Go’: Thousands in Zimbabwe Rally Against Leader', 'text': ' HARARE, Zimbabwe — Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans gathered in the capital on Saturday, hooting, whistling and hugging soldiers as they called for President Robert Mugabe to give up power, days after the military placed him under house arrest. In scenes perhaps unthinkable only weeks ago, people marched side by side with members of the military — who rode in armed tanks — and the protesters hailed the army as setting them free from Mr. Mugabe’s 37-year autocratic rule. \"Mugabe must go, and his goons must leave. We have been victimized by Mugabe for too long,\" said Nigel Mukwena, a 24-year-old student of political science at the University of Zimbabwe. Others took selfies of the military at the rally, which converged on Zimbabwe Grounds, known as the site of addresses by Mr. Mugabe and other icons of the nation’s liberation. The scenes, and the celebratory air, were a seminal shift for the country’s 93-year-old leader — Africa’s oldest. Brezhnev Malaba, assistant editor of The Zimbabwe Independent newspaper, tweeted in the early hours of the march: \"There are decades in which nothing happens; and then, suddenly, there are days in which whole decades happen. Zimbabwe is at that moment. Astonishing scenes here in Harare.\" For some Africans, Mr. Mugabe remains a nationalist hero, a symbol of the struggle to throw off the legacy of colonial rule. But he was also reviled as a dictator who resorted to violence to retain power and ran a once-robust economy into the ground. The military placed Mr. Mugabe under house arrest on Wednesday, effectively ending his long rule, but it allowed him to appear in public on Friday for a university graduation. The military sought to cast the action as an attempt to rid the president of the \"criminals\" in his government who have inflicted economic damage on the country. The president’s wife, Grace Mugabe, has not been seen in public since Wednesday. Her recent aspirations to succeed her husband — and her and their sons’ lavish lifestyles — appear to have been a trigger for his downfall. On Friday evening, a majority of the leaders of Mr. Mugabe’s governing ZANU-PF party, which he had controlled with an iron grip since independence in 1980, recommended his expulsion, according to ZBC, the state broadcaster. \"Many of us had watched with pain as the party and government were being reduced to the personal property of a few infiltrators with traitorous histories and questionable commitment to the people of Zimbabwe,\" the party leaders said in a resolution. \"Clearly, the country was going down the wrong path.\" A nephew of Mr. Mugabe’s, Patrick Zhuwao, told Reuters on Saturday that the president and his wife were \"ready to die for what is correct\" and had no intention of stepping down. Speaking from South Africa, Mr. Zhuwao was quoted as saying that Mr. Mugabe had hardly slept since the military seized power, but that his health was otherwise \"good.\" On Saturday morning, Zimbabweans — some chanting, \"Enough is enough!\" and carrying signs emblazoned with \"Mugabe must go\" — marched alongside soldiers in tanks mounted with machine guns. For many Zimbabweans, the atmosphere was electric and filled with hope. Marchers swarmed to the grounds, and drivers honked their horns. At one point, military aircraft streaked above the crowds. Later, demonstrators marched toward Mr. Mugabe’s residence in the exclusive Borrowdale suburb of Harare, where he was believed to be held in military custody. \"Soldiers are being feted as heroes on the streets of Harare,\" Mr. Malaba, the editor, said on Twitter. \"Euphoric scenes. People are standing next to army tanks and taking selfies. I’ve seen chaps excitedly polishing soldiers’ boots in a gesture of gratitude. This is unprecedented. Historic!\" Benita Mudondo, 57, came to the rally from the Nyanga District, more than 180 miles to the east, near the border with Mozambique. \"Surely Zimbabwe, our country, is back — the one country we fought for,\" she said. \"We had given up, but had become worried about the future of our children and grandchildren.\" Her husband, Ernst Mudondo, 67, a war veteran, said, \"Our joy only starts today, and we are so happy.\" Their daughter, Michelle Mudondo, 17, added: \"We want to see our country on a path back to recovery; I look forward to a stable government with a stable economy without shortages of cash.\" Economic opportunity was cited by others. \"I am here because I want a job, and Mugabe couldn’t deliver,\" said Simbarashe Sakuona, 23, who said he had a degree in marketing from Midlands State University. \"We were witnessing a bedroom coup as Grace now called the shots. Grace can’t be a leader.\" The prospect that the end of Mr. Mugabe’s era could unleash a crisis on the African continent spurred the South African president, Jacob Zuma, to send envoys to try to defuse the situation. Mr. Zuma said on Saturday that his country was committed to supporting \"the people of Zimbabwe,\" according to Reuters. He added that he was cautiously optimistic that the situation could be resolved amicably. Now, Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, the vice president of Zimbabwe until he was fired recently, is in line to become the country’s new leader. Observers say he shares some of Mr. Mugabe’s traits, including a hunger for power and a taste for repression.

The Obstacles Can Be Big, Too.', 'text': ' President Trump says he is frustrated with the slow pace of major construction projects like highways, ports and pipelines. Last summer, he pledged to use the power of the presidency to jump start building when it became bogged down in administrative delays. \"No longer will we allow the infrastructure of our magnificent country to crumble and decay,\" Mr. Trump said in August. In an executive order, the president directed federal agencies to coordinate environmental impact reviews for major projects with the goal of completing them within two years. Such reviews can often take four years and, in some cases, even longer. Other presidents, including Barack Obama, have tried with mixed success to streamline the approvals for big infrastructure projects by pushing federal agencies to do environmental reviews faster. Frequently, delays are caused because multiple agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Army Corps of Engineers, weigh in on the scope of an environmental review or have to issue separate permits before work can begin. The centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s plan gives an office, the Council on Environmental Quality, within the White House, the authority to coordinate actions and direct how environmental reviews are performed. Much of the plan’s inspiration lies in a report, \"Two Years Not Ten Years,\" issued in 2015 by Common Good, a nonpartisan research and advocacy group. The report estimated that the typical six-year delay in starting large building projects costs the country $3.7 trillion in lost economic activity, more than twice the amount needed to address the most urgent infrastructure needs. Along with roadblocks to speedy federal approval, the report blamed delays on such factors as fear of litigation and overly broad environmental reviews on all levels of government. \"They have embraced some of the goals and core ideas\" in our report, said Philip K. Howard, who heads Common Good and is a lawyer at Covington & Burling in Manhattan. He had been a member of President Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum, which disbanded in August after Mr. Trump’s remarks about the racial violence in Charlottesville, Va. An analysis by the Congressional Research Service found that some of the claims in Common Good’s report, including the $3.7 trillion estimate, lacked a statistical basis, though the group had defended its work. Infrastructure experts say that a lack of public and private funding, rather than bureaucratic delays, is the principal reason infrastructure projects stall. (In its budget proposal, the Trump administration has issued a six-page fact sheet about infrastructure funding, including private investment.) Still, they agree that the permitting process can be improved and streamlined. In addition to federal reviews, states and local governments must also approve major proposals — frequently a fraught process — and residents and other interest groups often use the courts to block or delay construction. Several recent projects illustrate the pitfalls new proposals confront and the challenge Mr. Trump faces in breaking the logjams. Long-overdue maintenance this summer to the train tracks leading to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan came against the backdrop of a much more ambitious project that never happened. The plan, known as Access to the Region’s Core, or ARC, would have created a new tunnel underneath the Hudson River for New Jersey Transit trains. First unveiled during the 1990s, it was promoted as the nation’s biggest public transportation infrastructure project and was supposed to cost $9 billion, create thousands of construction jobs and was funded by the federal government, New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. After years of environmental reviews, drilling of the ARC tunnel was underway in 2009. But construction stopped for a reason that has doomed other projects — disagreements among the various governments. In this case, it was New Jersey. Gov. Chris Christie, who originally supported the tunnel, killed it in 2010 for what he cited were issues related to potential cost overruns. Today, nearly a decade and a thousand train delays later, the concept behind the ARC tunnel has re-emerged in a reconfigured form as the Gateway Program, a $20-billion design that also involves a new rail tunnel below the Hudson River and the rehabilitation of an existing one. It would be used by New Jersey Transit and Amtrak trains. A small portion of tunnel drilling for ARC will be used in Gateway New York and New Jersey officials support the project, and the environmental review for it took only two years rather than the usual four, said John D. Porcari, the project’s interim executive director. If all goes as planned, the Gateway project is anticipated to be completed in 2026. But there is still one hang-up: The Trump administration has yet to climb onboard. The law generally does not allow the federal government to pre-empt permitting decisions made by state and local officials. So even before federal delays might come into play, some projects are dead — or close to it — on arrival. An exception, experts say, involves areas overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, which has jurisdiction over projects such as natural gas pipelines and electric power lines. FERC’s authority recently came into play during a dispute in New York State over a relatively small project: a proposed $38 million plan to build a 7.8-mile-long branch off an existing natural gas pipeline to connect it with a power plant near Middletown, N.Y. When the Millennium Pipeline Company announced the project in 2015, it drew opposition from communities opposed to hydraulic fracking, a controversial method of extracting natural gas that is banned in New York. State officials also jumped into the dispute, arguing in court that FERC had failed, among other things, to account for the environmental impacts of added greenhouse gas emissions from the power plant before approving the pipeline. But in June, a federal judge agreed with Millennium’s argument that state officials had failed to voice their objections in a timely fashion and referred the issue back to FERC, which has since issued a waiver to allow the company to proceed. State officials have asked FERC to review the case. The expected cost of the pipeline extension has since risen to $57 million based on actions that the company said it had taken to address the state’s concerns. Mr. Howard, the lawyer from Common Good, has argued that Congress should enact legislation that would give the federal government more authority to overrule state and local permitting reviews. No such proposal exists in Congress. Some projects that are big drivers of the economy do not involve federal approvals. Delays result from state and local decisions, and Mr. Trump — or any federal official for that matter — does not have the standing to intervene. A good illustration is the long-delayed effort by the BNSF Railway to build a new intermodal facility in Southern California. The facility would transfer cargo containers arriving on ships from Asia to freight trains headed east to cities such as Denver and Chicago. BNSF says it has invested about $50 million for such things as studies needed to comply with the permitting process. Currently, cargo containers arriving at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are picked up by tractor-trailers and driven to an existing BNSF site in downtown Los Angeles for transfer to trains. BNSF estimates show that it is a journey of 24 miles that 1,000 trucks make daily. In 2005, BNSF announced a proposal to build a transfer point just four miles from the ports that would reduce truck travel, highway congestion and air pollution, according to the company. In 2013, Los Angeles approved the company’s environmental impact report and issued a construction permit. But an environmental group and a local air quality district challenged that decision, citing the facility’s potential impact on nearby residential communities. In 2016, a California state judge upheld that challenge and ordered BNSF to expand its review to include a broader regional study assessing the facility’s environmental impact. The company has appealed that decision and expects a decision in coming months. Building of any sort has environmental consequences, and big building can have big consequences, making environmental objections a central factor in delaying federal projects. Such a case is playing out in Utah. A proposed highway, known as the Northern Corridor, is intended to ease future congestion around St. George, one of this country’s fastest-growing metropolitan areas. But the seven-mile-long highway also raises an environmental dilemma because a portion of it would run through federally owned land that is home to a protected species, the Mojave desert tortoise, which can live up to 50 years. The dispute over the highway has been underway for more than a decade. Local officials have argued that they could build the road without endangering the tortoises, and in 2009, a federal law directed the Bureau of Land Management to identify a possible route. But when the bureau released a plan last year, the agency was skeptical of the route favored by local officials because of its potential impact on sensitive habitat. Soon afterward, Representative Chris Stewart, a Republican of Utah, introduced legislation that would require federal agencies, including the bureau, to approve the route if it met all other permitting requirements. In July, the bill passed a House committee and may be taken up by the full House later this year or next. Farmers in southern Missouri, who experience severe flooding, have long supported a plan to close a quarter-mile gap in a large levee along the Mississippi River. And since 1975, the Army Corps of Engineers has offered a variety of ways to plug the levee. But that would also drain wetlands and potentially increase flooding elsewhere, causing officials with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to put on the brakes. In 2007, a federal judge blocked further development on the $161 million project, which is known as the St. Johns Bayou and New Madrid Floodway, finding that the Army Corps had failed to use sound science to examine its environmental impact. The agencies then said they would work together to resolve their differences. But by 2013 the gridlock remained so intense that Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, placed a temporary hold on Gina McCarthy’s nomination to head the E.P.A. in an effort to resolve the standstill. Last year, President Obama’s Council on Environmental Quality, the White House office, sided with the opponents. It held that efforts by the Army Corps to mitigate the project’s impacts, while extensive, were not enough. That, however, might not be the final word. The environmental council left the door open to resolution of concerns, and President Trump’s nominee to head the Army Corps, Rickey Dale James, owns a business in the area and has been a longtime supporter of the project.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/business/trump-wants-more-big-infrastructure-projects-the-obstacles-can-be-big-too.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Republican Governors’ 2018 Dilemma: What to Do About Trump?', 'text': ' AUSTIN, Tex. — For nearly a decade, meetings of the Republican Governors Association were buoyant, even giddy, affairs, as the party — lifted by enormous political donations and a backlash against the Obama administration — achieved overwhelming control of state governments. But a sense of foreboding hung over the group’s gathering in Austin this past week, as President Trump’s unpopularity and Republicans’ unexpectedly drastic losses in elections earlier this month in Virginia, New Jersey and suburbs from Philadelphia to Seattle raised the specter of a political reckoning in 2018. \"I do think Virginia was a wake-up call,\" said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, who took over here as chairman of the governors association. \"There’s a pretty strong message there. When Republicans lose white married women, that’s a strong message.\" In a series of closed-door meetings, governors tangled over how best to avoid being tainted by Mr. Trump, and debated the delicate task of steering Mr. Trump’s political activities away from states where he might be unhelpful. Several complained directly to Vice President Mike Pence, prodding him to ensure that the White House intervenes only in races in which its involvement is welcome. A larger group of governors from agricultural and auto-producing states warned Mr. Pence that Mr. Trump’s proposed withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement could damage them badly. Republicans have long anticipated that the midterm campaign will prove difficult. But the drubbing they suffered in Virginia, where they lost the governorship by nine percentage points, along with at least 15 State House seats threaded throughout the state’s suburbs, has the party’s governors worried that 2018 could be worse than feared. Voters appear eager to punish Mr. Trump. \"Any time the titular head of the party is underwater, obviously there’s going to be issues there. You can’t just ignore that,\" said Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, who is facing re-election in a state that Mr. Trump lost by less than a percentage point. The battle for Congress, already center stage, will draw only more attention if the embattled Roy S. Moore loses an Alabama Senate race in December, jeopardizing Republican control of the chamber. But the contests for governor are perhaps more consequential. Next year’s statehouse races will reorder the country’s political map for a decade, because many of the 36 governors elected will have a strong hand in redrawing state legislative and congressional boundaries after the 2020 census. Several candidates and strategists said the governors association had been pressing recruits to define themselves early and develop independent personal brands. But that is a more complicated task than it was during the Obama years, when Republican governors shared an easy template of railing against a Democratic administration and fiscal profligacy at the state level. What Republicans agree on is that their candidates must avoid the contortions of Ed Gillespie, their Virginia nominee for governor, who embraced Mr. Trump’s divisive messages on immigration, crime and Confederate \"heritage\" but danced inartfully around whether he actually supported the president. \"You can’t be halfway in and halfway out,\" said Gov. Phil Bryant of Mississippi, a conservative and admirer of Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Haslam, a more centrist voice who did not vote for Mr. Trump, agreed. \"If you try to wear somebody else’s clothes, they never fit,\" he said. But that consensus breaks down over whether to appear with Mr. Trump in their states. Gov. Paul LePage of Maine, a fierce supporter of Mr. Trump’s, said Republicans should \"absolutely\" stump with the president in 2018. \"He is the leader of our country,\" Mr. LePage said. \"He is the leader of our country, and we should respect our leader.\" Yet even one of Mr. Trump’s most enthusiastic cheerleaders declined to say whether he would welcome the president to campaign alongside him in 2018. Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, who is expected to challenge Senator Bill Nelson next year, repeatedly ducked questions at a news conference about whether he believed Mr. Trump would be helpful to Republicans during the midterm elections. In a visit to Florida in September, Mr. Trump publicly urged Mr. Scott, who describes the president as a personal friend, to oppose Mr. Nelson for the Senate seat. \"We’ll see what happens in 2018,\" Mr. Scott said, insisting: \"I don’t know if I’m going to be a candidate.\" Other Republican governors do not bother with the rhetorical dance, believing that an invitation to Mr. Trump is a political death wish. His approval rating is in the 30s in a swath of states that the party will be defending next year, and the last thing that governors in liberal-leaning or even moderate parts of the country want to do is make it easier for Democrats to link them to the president. Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, who faces a 2018 re-election fight in one of the country’s bluest states, urged Republican candidates to distinguish themselves from \"the mess in Washington,\" and instead stress economic issues close to home. So far, Mr. Hogan said, Republicans are not running campaigns equal to the political environment. \"We’ve got to run some more effective campaigns,\" he said, \"that aren’t quite as negative and divisive.\" Asked whether it was safe to assume that he would keep Mr. Trump out of Maryland, Mr. Hogan chuckled and said: \"That’s pretty safe.\" After Mr. Pence delivered public remarks, winning restrained applause from a lobbyist-heavy audience when he brought greetings from Mr. Trump, he used a private meeting with the governors on Wednesday to tell them that the White House stood ready to help their campaigns, according to Republican officials who were in the room and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal private conversations. Mr. Hogan and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, the departing head of the governors association, candidly told Mr. Pence that they hoped the administration would prove collaborative and respect the wishes of governors who want Mr. Trump to stay away. After Mr. Pence returned to Washington, the discussions turned more blunt. In a separate meeting, political strategists briefed the governors on the Virginia results in depth, outlining just how badly swamped Mr. Gillespie had been by Democratic turnout, two attendees said. In that session, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a former chairman of the governors association, said the group should prepare to raise an unprecedented sum of money — the figure he floated was $130 million — to fund political rescue operations in the crucial final months of the 2018 campaign. Such conversations mostly took place out of earshot of the news media. More than a dozen governors declined to be interviewed. One of the private sessions was devoted to \"Disrupting the Mainstream Media.\" And in their main public remarks, few Republicans seemed willing to acknowledge the forbidding political environment that appears to be developing. Answering questions from reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Walker played down the significance of Republicans’ recent defeats in New Jersey and Virginia. He described both of them as Democratic states. Mr. Pence, in his speech and even in his private comments, did not hint at the looming obstacles for Republicans in 2018 or mention how the administration would address the prospect that Mr. Moore, who has been accused of making sexual advances on teenagers, will win the Alabama Senate seat. Privately, though, some of the governors acknowledged the gulf between their base voters and themselves when it comes to Mr. Trump. Voicing contempt for the president the way that Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, both retiring senators, have would only cause difficulties for them and their would-be Republican successors in primaries, where loyalty to Mr. Trump could become a litmus test. While few would criticize Mr. Trump directly, Republicans in Austin expressed fear that the party was becoming defined as divisive, even nasty, turning off the swing voters who helped bring Republican governors to prominence throughout the Obama years. Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a Republican seeking a second term in 2018, said the party had to communicate in a tone \"that’s respectful of diversity, that’s respectful of trying to find solutions in a civil manner.\" Catering to fiery activists, he said, would be a recipe for ruin. \"If we don’t convey the right tone, we might energize a small percent of our base, but we still need to have independents,\" said Mr. Hutchinson, who is facing a primary challenge from the right. \"We still need to have those that are not traditional Republicans, that are joining in our coalition. You don’t want to turn those voters off.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/us/politics/republican-governors-trump-backlash-2018.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'He Fled Myanmar on a Deathtrap. Now He’s the ‘Luckiest Man Alive.’', 'text': ' DALLAS — Mohamed Rafiq was emaciated, close to joining the pile of dead bodies at one end of the boat, when he was rescued. Barely conscious, Mr. Rafiq was too weak to walk. Foreign sailors picked him up and gave him medicine. It was the first time, said Mr. Rafiq, 39, a Rohingya Muslim, that he had ever been treated with kindness by someone of a different ethnicity. \"I couldn’t even speak because I didn’t know how to move my mouth,\" Mr. Rafiq said recently through a translator. \"I was so hungry and so thirsty. I wished I could drink, but I could not drink.\" When help came, he added, \"I thought I was reborn.\" Mr. Rafiq, a member of one of the most persecuted ethnic groups in the world, was fleeing Myanmar in 2008, aiming to find work to support his growing family. But the ferryboat on which he and scores of other Rohingya men fled their country, with benches and no shade, became a deathtrap. The Rohingya in Myanmar are restricted to their villages by laws that prohibit them from traveling within their own country. They are a stateless people denied citizenship, rights and protection. And abuses against the Rohingya — shootings, rapes and burning of villages — have recently intensified to such an extent that United Nations officials have said they may constitute crimes against humanity. The United States secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, visited Myanmar this month and called the situation \"horrific.\" Mr. Rafiq and his family, who were separated for eight years, settled together in Dallas last year. Helping Mr. Rafiq reunite with his mother, his wife and their three children was the International Rescue Committee, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. After his rescue at sea and recovery in Sri Lanka, the International Organization for Migration helped Mr. Rafiq enter the United States and settle in New Hampshire. He heard that Dallas had a larger Rohingya community, so he moved there and began the paperwork to bring his family to America. Around age 10, Mr. Rafiq began traveling on foot to sell vegetables and cheap clothing in nearby villages. The police would beat and rob him, he said. He sometimes begged them to let him keep half his earnings, but such pleas were ignored; Mr. Rafiq said the beatings were often so severe that it was painful to walk home. He continued this work until he was about 30, when he had two children and a pregnant wife to support. He decided to join other Rohingya men in an attempt to find work in a neighboring country. Nearly 100 of them crammed onto a boat in February 2008 and set out for what they expected to be a 12-day journey to Malaysia. The engine died at sea. Thirst and hunger set in, killing more than a dozen men. Bodies eventually had to be thrown overboard because the smell was so horrible, Mr. Rafiq said. Adrift at sea for four weeks, Mr. Rafiq was stripped of energy and could not move. He watched a friend pass out and die after he drank seawater. \"I am ready to die,\" he recalled thinking. Then the Sri Lankan Navy found the boat drifting in the Bay of Bengal. \"Two young men grabbed me by my arms. They pulled me out from the boat,\" Mr. Rafiq said. \"They gave me an injection because I wasn’t able to speak. After two or three days I got better, and they gave me soft food, spoon by spoon.\" Mr. Rafiq’s mother, Sara Khatoon, 60, said concern for her son was compounded by the complete lack of news about what had happened to the men on the boat. \"For two months after he left I did not receive any information about my son,\" she said. \"I didn’t know where he was.\" A tremendous sense of relief spread through the village after the BBC reported that a foreign navy had found a boat full of skeletal men clinging to life. A woman came to Mr. Rafiq’s mother and told her, \"Your son survived, and my son survived,\" she said. Mr. Rafiq and the other survivors were brought to a refugee camp in Sri Lanka, where he said he was unable to speak for a month. He made a clawing motion at his throat, saying that it felt so dry that he could not make a sound. When he finally could talk, he asked to call his family. He called the one person in his village who had a cellphone. Mr. Rafiq’s wife, Nur Hasina, 33, recalled the villager running to her with the phone. \"When I heard his voice,\" Ms. Hasina said through an interpreter, \"I asked him: ‘Where have you been? It has been too long. We have not heard anything from you.’ He said: ‘I cannot explain it right now. It’s a very long story. I will talk to you later, but I am alive and in Sri Lanka.’\" Mr. Rafiq and the other survivors refused to be sent back to Myanmar for fear of torture and execution. He stayed in Sri Lanka for four years, spending most of his time living in group housing provided by the Muslim Aid charity. After arriving in Dallas in 2013, he began working with the International Rescue Committee to reunite with his family. His family had no legal rights to leave Myanmar, so they followed his instructions to sneak into India. They told border guards that they were traveling to Bangladesh for medical treatment, paid bribes and had other relatives furtively pass them their documents over a fence at the border. After two years in India, Mr. Rafiq’s mother, wife and three children arrived in Dallas in August 2016. \"I was so happy when I saw them,\" Mr. Rafiq said. \"I was thankful to the U.S. government, the community and the people who helped to have my family reunite with me. I thank all of them, and God,\" Mr. Rafiq said. \"I have three children, but my youngest one didn’t recognize me. I needed to talk to her a lot, and after that she started talking to me.\" The family of seven lives in a two-bedroom apartment with a tiny kitchen in an apartment complex filled with other refugees. Congolese and Bosnian children played soccer outside in mid-November as Mr. Rafiq talked of his new life and the arrival of the couple’s fourth child over the summer. Asked several times to describe his family’s needs, Mr. Rafiq would say only that he had to keep his 2002 Toyota running to get to his job as a dishwasher and that he faced $4,000 in medical bills for his mother’s high blood sugar. The family says her worries about the relatives she left behind in Myanmar exacerbate her health issues. Mr. Rafiq walks with a limp and suffers back pain and memory problems from the beatings he once endured. But he says he is living a privileged life. \"I feel like I am the luckiest man alive — I can build my life in the United States,\" he said. \"Here it’s easy. I was dying on the boat. Compared to that here, in America, it’s easy.\" His gratitude is mixed with anguish about the staggering atrocities unleashed back home on his fellow Rohingya in August. He said he watched news of the mass murders on his cellphone and cried. He worries for relatives who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh and India. \"I want to donate some money to my sisters and their family in Bangladesh; I won’t use any money here for Thanksgiving,\" he said. \"I am fine, but they are suffering.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/nyregion/he-fled-myanmar-on-a-deathtrap-now-hes-the-luckiest-man-alive.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Louisiana Man Freed After 45 Years as Conviction is Tossed Out', 'text': ' With his 1974 rape conviction recently thrown out by a judge, Wilbert Jones of Louisiana walked out of the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison this week after nearly half a century behind bars. Freed on $2,000 bail on Wednesday, Mr. Jones, 65, greeted family members in the prison’s parking lot, where he smiled and told reporters that he was ready to \"enjoy life\" and \"praise God.\" His release was years in the making. But he could still return to prison if the state’s plan to appeal a District Court judge’s decision to vacate Mr. Jones’s conviction is successful. In 1971, a nurse, identified in court documents as A. H., was raped in the parking lot of the hospital where she worked in Baton Rouge. Months later, she identified Mr. Jones out of a lineup as her attacker. He was 19 when he was arrested, and the victim’s testimony eventually led to a conviction and a life sentence without parole. Mr. Jones has maintained his innocence. In 2003, Innocence Project New Orleans, a nonprofit law office, began looking into the case and was instrumental in bringing it to the attention of the Louisiana Supreme Court, which referred it to the state’s District Court. In October, Judge Richard D. Anderson of Louisiana District Court ruled that because important evidence had been withheld from the defense at trial — specifically, that another man who fit the description of the suspect was accused of committing similar crimes in the same area — Mr. Jones’s conviction should be vacated. \"This Court finds that the State’s case against Jones was weak, at best,\" Judge Anderson wrote in his ruling. \"There was no forensic or physical evidence linking Jones to the rape of A. H. The State’s case against Jones rested entirely on A. H.’s testimony and questionable identification.\" He added that the victim expressed uncertainty about her identification at the time of the trial. In a phone interview, Emily Maw, the director of Innocence Project New Orleans, noted that \"an unsure identification was enough to send a young black man away for the rest of his life without the possibility of parole.\" She said the 1974 conviction was not necessarily the result of any individual prosecutor withholding evidence with malicious intent. \"It is an entire system that does not think it needs to take the care to make sure that these criminal investigations and trials are as accurate as they can possibly be,\" she said. But prosecutors intend to appeal the decision to vacate Mr. Jones’s conviction; if the appeal is successful, he could be sent back to prison for the rest of his life. In an emailed statement, Hillar C. Moore III, the East Baton Rouge district attorney, said his office would be filing an appeal by Dec. 1 in an effort to \"continue to seek justice for the victim,\" who died in 2008. He added: \"Two juries heard the evidence and heard and saw this victim testify and identify her attacker after being subjected to a brutal abduction and repeated rapes. The victim was with her attacker for at least an hour and was able to clearly see and later identify as well as speak with him.\" But on Wednesday, Mr. Jones told reporters he had been imprisoned for something he didn’t do. \"I’m going to get out there and speak to the young kids,\" he said, adding, \"Go the right way, and trust in God.\" Ms. Maw said Mr. Jones \"got a very good night’s rest\" as he adjusted to freedom after 45 years and 10 months behind bars. \"He is calm, grateful, humble and has developed a strength and a patience that I think most people could not even begin to understand.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/us/louisiana-rape-conviction.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Time Capsule, Long Forgotten at the Space Needle, Is Found', 'text': ' Construction workers in Seattle unearthed a long-forgotten time capsule at the Space Needle this week. Millions of people who visited the 605-foot tower in the past 35 years likely walked right by it. Not that they would have noticed. At some point long ago, there was an adjacent plaque advertising the capsule’s existence and noting that it should be opened in 2002. But somewhere along the way, that plaque disappeared. The year 2002 came and went. Space Needle employees who helped install the capsule scattered, and memories faded. But this week, construction workers completing a $100 million renovation stumbled upon the capsule. The heavy metal box was on the observation deck level, attached to a steel support bar and hidden behind plaster encasement. It was not far from the doors to one of the main elevators — the so-called Blue Elevator, to be exact. Word of the discovery got to Rod Kauffman, who was the operations manager at the Space Needle in 1982 and helped to put the capsule together. And so on Friday morning — more than 15 years late — the capsule was opened, and Mr. Kauffman, wearing a hard hat and reflective vest, went through the capsule’s contents, item by item. There were letters, photographs and postcards from 1982. Some mementos dated all the way to 1962, the year the Space Needle opened and Seattle hosted the World’s Fair. Mr. Kauffman pulled out a master key that he said \"opened every lock in the Space Needle\" in 1982. He pointed to a black-and-white photograph of three women in shiny dresses: \"elevator operators from 1962.\" There was an old menu for the restaurant, Top of the Needle, offering crayfish bisque and scallops primavera. There was an old reel of audio tape, and on it, a recording of a 1982 broadcast commemorating the 20th anniversary of the World’s Fair. In a phone interview, Mr. Kauffman said he was excited not only about those items, but also about the capsule itself. On the outside was a sketch of the tower by John Graham, the architect who designed the Space Needle. And Mr. Kauffman’s own wife, whom he met on the elevator at the Space Needle, had written in careful calligraphy on the top: \"Time Capsule to be opened April 21, 2002.\" \"People are like, ‘Well, why was there a 15-year lag?’\" said Dave Mandapat, the Space Needle’s public relations director. \"And it’s because I don’t think anyone knew about it.\" Mr. Mandapat, who has worked at the Space Needle for 21 years, had heard that a capsule existed at the Space Needle — but he didn’t know where. Ahead of this year’s renovation project, he spoke with people like Bob Witter, who was a duty manager at the Space Needle in 1982. But Mr. Mandapat could never pinpoint the exact location of the capsule and thought that perhaps it had been lost in some renovation project. He was happy the capsule was unveiled Friday morning. But perhaps not as much as Mr. Witter, who loves the Space Needle so much he got married in it. Mr. Witter was even there as a child, at the 1962 World’s Fair, and one of his contributions to the capsule was a photograph from that event. Another was paint chips: In 1982, he climbed to the roof of the tower to dig out some flakes of the orange hue that had topped the tower two decades earlier. \"Thankfully, this renovation project happened,\" Mr. Witter said. \"Because had this not happened, the mystery would have gone on and on and on.\" So what now for the capsule and the dozens of keepsakes inside? That is still up for discussion. Mr. Mandapat said the time capsule might be hidden away again next year — this time, with instructions not to open it up again until 2062, the Seattle World’s Fair centennial.

He was 102. The law firm his father helped start, Three Raymond Buildings, confirmed his death on its website. It did not give a cause or say where he died. From the 1960s to the ’80s, Mr. Hutchinson, ennobled by the British royal family in 1978 as Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, joined or led legal teams in some of the most celebrated cases of that era, establishing himself as a top criminal defense lawyer. It was a time in which the erosion of moral taboos in the swinging ’60s and the cloak-and-dagger machinations of the Cold War combined to produce a steady supply of dramatic trials. Mr. Hutchinson defended Penguin Books for publishing D. H. Lawrence’s \"Lady Chatterley’s Lover\"; represented the model Christine Keeler in the so-called Profumo Affair, which combined sex, spies and scandal; and sought unsuccessfully to avert a 42-year jail term for George Blake, a Soviet double agent who later escaped from a British prison and fled to Moscow. Mr. Hutchinson often fought against the prevailing definitions of obscenity in cases that were seen as landmarks in Britain’s transition from a prudish and hidebound society to a more open and tolerant one. In 1960, as a junior counsel in the \"Lady Chatterley\" case, he played a prominent part in examining prestigious witnesses, including the novelist E. M. Forster, to support the argument that the novel, which explicitly describes the physical relationship between an upper-crust married woman and her husband’s gamekeeper, was a work of literature, not pornography. \"I believe you have written some novels,\" he said in addressing Mr. Forster before the court to establish the author’s credentials. Mr. Hutchinson also sought to ensure that the jury included as many women as possible because, he said, \"women are much more sensible about sex — men get so worked up about it.\" The trial fascinated ordinary Britons and seemed to illuminate the gulf between them and a judiciary largely drawn from the elite. Indeed, the prosecutor in the trial, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, went so far as to ask whether \"Lady Chatterley\" was \"a book you would wish your wives or servants to read\" — a question redolent with assumptions about class, gender and lifestyle from an earlier era. Mr. Hutchinson, for his part, was the first to admit that as he tilted in court against the British establishment, he was also very much a product of it, having been educated at private school and Oxford University. In 1963, he defended Christine Keeler, a model and showgirl who pleaded guilty to committing perjury as a witness in earlier trials relating to the Profumo Affair, which almost brought down the conservative government of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. The scandal involved John Profumo, the minister for war, who was accused of sharing Ms. Keeler’s sexual favors with Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet naval attaché, thereby possibly endangering national security. Mr. Profumo was forced to quit, while Ms. Keeler acquired a reputation in the press as a temptress. Mr. Hutchinson, by contrast, depicted her in court as a vulnerable young woman who had been used by many male partners and should not suffer retribution. \"I know your lordship will resist the temptation for what I might call society’s pound of flesh,\" he told the judge. She was given a relatively brief prison term of nine months. In 1982, in another well-publicized case that again involved the issue of obscenity, Mr. Hutchinson defended the director of a play called \"The Romans in Britain\" against charges of gross indecency. The case, brought by Mary Whitehouse, a prominent campaigner for moral standards, alleged that Graham Ross-Cornes, her solicitor, had spied an exposed erect penis during a performance of the play. But Mr. Hutchinson demonstrated with theatrical gestures that what Mr. Ross-Cornes had really seen was an actor’s thumb. The case against the director was dropped. Jeremy Nicolas Hutchinson was born in London on March 29, 1915, to parents who belonged to the literary clique known as the Bloomsbury Set. His father, St. John Hutchinson, was also a barrister, and his mother, the former Mary Barnes, was widely believed to have been the model for the title character in Virginia Woolf’s 1925 novel, \"Mrs. Dalloway.\" Mr. Hutchinson attended private school at Stowe in Buckinghamshire, west of London, and studied at Magdalen College, Oxford. During World War II, he served in the Royal Navy and was aboard the destroyer H.M.S. Kelly when German warplanes sank it off the Greek island of Crete in May 1941. He was rescued after hours at sea, clinging to debris and singing vaudeville songs with other survivors, including the ship’s commander, Lord Louis Mountbatten, a descendant of Queen Victoria. Mountbatten became First Sea Lord and mentor to Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne. A year earlier, Mr. Hutchinson had married the actress Peggy Ashcroft after a whirlwind romance. They divorced in 1966. Shortly afterward, he married June Osborn, the aristocratic widow of the concert pianist Franz Osborn. She died in 2006. Mr. Hutchinson had two children by his first marriage — a daughter, Eliza, an artist who died in 2016, and a son, Nicholas, an actor and director. Complete information on his survivors was not available, though some biographical sources say he had grandchildren. After the war, Mr. Hutchinson stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in the Westminster district of central London, where one of his constituents was Winston Churchill. Mr. Hutchinson, resolving to canvass the district for support, went to 10 Downing Street, the official residence of British prime ministers. Churchill was not home, however, so Mr. Hutchinson delivered a political speech to Churchill’s staff. He financed his early days as a barrister by selling a painting by Monet, which he had inherited. Among his less successful trials as a senior barrister was his defense of George Blake, unmasked in 1961 as a double agent who had used his position at Britain’s foreign intelligence service, MI6, to aid the Soviet K.G.B. in the earliest days of the Cold War. He was sentenced under the Official Secrets Act to three consecutive 14-year terms in prison for his offenses. Mr. Hutchinson said the severity of Mr. Blake’s punishment would provoke either madness or escape — a prophecy fulfilled in 1966 when Mr. Blake broke out of Wormwood Scrubs prison in London and was spirited to Moscow, where he is believed to still be living at 95. Mr. Hutchinson was also said to have been one of the real-life lawyers who inspired his friend John Mortimer, a barrister and author, to create Horace Rumpole, a fictional character in books and on radio and television shows known as Rumpole of the Bailey.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/obituaries/jeremy-hutchinson-a-top-lawyer-in-high-profile-cases-dies-at-102.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'John Raines, 84, Who Evaded Capture in an F.B.I. Break-in, Dies', 'text': ' One day in May 1971, John C. Raines, a religion professor at Temple University, had just returned to his home in Germantown, Pa., from playing tennis when two F.B.I. agents knocked on the door. For weeks, hundreds of agents had been combing Philadelphia for the amateur burglars who had embarrassed the F.B.I. by raiding a suburban field office and stealing a thousand files, and then baffled the bureau by evading capture. The documents were delivered anonymously to journalists and congressmen as proof that the bureau had systematically and illegally infiltrated, intimidated and disrupted protest groups. The two agents asked whether Dr. Raines, who, with his wife, Bonnie Raines, was known as an antiwar protester, could help identify the culprits. Startled by the question, Dr. Raines needed time to deliberate. He excused himself to shower. When he returned downstairs, he coolly took the offensive. \"I’m so angry about what I’ve been reading in the press about the F.B.I. and the abuses that have taken place that I’m not going to talk to you about any of it,\" Dr. Raines said to the agents, his wife recalled on Thursday. \"I’m not going to make your job any easier. I’m not going to answer your question.\" For nearly two decades, no one from the government asked him the question again. And so no one learned that he had been one of eight antiwar activists, including his wife, who took part in the burglary — and that he had driven a getaway car, the family station wagon. As he hid in plain sight, Dr. Raines remained mute about the episode, the couple’s last protest against the war in Vietnam. \"We didn’t need attention, because we had done what needed to be done,\" Dr. Raines told The New York Times in 2014. \"The ’60s were over. We didn’t have to hold on to what we did back then.\" Nearly 20 years after the break-in, Betty Medsger, a reporter who had received copies of the purloined documents and wrote about them for The Washington Post in 1971, was visiting Philadelphia when Dr. Raines, a former Methodist minister whom she had met years earlier while covering religion, invited her to dinner at his home. There, by his account, as quoted in Philadelphia magazine, he introduced his youngest daughter to Ms. Medsger by saying, \"When your mother and I had very important information about the F.B.I. we wanted to give the American people, we gave it to Betty.\" Ms. Medsger was stunned. Until then, she had never known the source of the stolen F.B.I. records. Another two decades would pass before the public finally learned of Dr. Raines’s role, with the publication of a book by Ms. Medsger, \"The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover’s Secret FBI,\" in 2014, and the release that same year of Johanna Hamilton’s documentary \"1971.\" Dr. Raines was suddenly transformed from a beloved retired professor into an indelible historical footnote in a case that Ms. Medsger would write was \"perhaps the most powerful single act of nonviolent resistance in American history.\" The burglary, and subsequent lawsuits by NBC and others, prompted a groundbreaking investigation in 1975 by the so-called Church committee, a special Senate panel led by Senator Frank Church of Idaho. The committee revealed details of the F.B.I.’s secret Cointelpro, or counterintelligence, operation, which included illegal sabotage of dissident groups deemed to be subversive. Dr. Raines died on Sunday in Philadelphia at 84. His wife said the cause was congestive heart failure. The burglary, on March 8, 1971, at the F.B.I. office in an apartment building across from the county courthouse in Media, Pa., prompted a debate over whether the perpetrators were traitors who wantonly exposed official secrets or heroic whistle-blowers who preserved civil liberties. The break-in was evoked in 2013 when Edward J. Snowden, a government contractor, revealed the National Security Agency’s classified global surveillance program. The crime was conceived by Professor William C. Davidon of Haverford College in Pennsylvania and plotted in the Raineses’ attic. At first, Dr. Raines was incredulous. \"After the chin came off the floor and we started talking about it,\" he told The Temple News in 2014, \"it seemed more and more plausible.\" The eight conspirators, five men and three women, ranged in age from 20 to 44 and included another professor, a graduate student, two recent college dropouts and Ms. Raines, who worked in a day care center. She scoped out the office, pretending to be a Swarthmore student researching the bureau’s receptivity to hiring women. The couple enlisted Dr. Raines’s brother to care for their three children, all younger than 10, if they were caught and imprisoned. \"It still amazes me that they did it,\" their son Nathan told Philadelphia magazine. \"I respect it. I’m proud of them. But I am still pretty blown away that they put our lives, our happiness, as children, at such risk.\" Dr. Raines explained to CNN in 2014 that the couple had what he described as \"a double responsibility — yes, as parents to our children, but also as citizens to the nation those children are going to live in and have children in.\" \"It became pretty obvious to us,\" he told The Times, \"that if we don’t do it, nobody will.\" Wearing gloves and armed with a lock pick and a crow bar while potential witnesses in the building were preoccupied watching the Joe Frazier-Muhammad Ali heavyweight championship fight, the burglars spent 45 minutes stuffing files into suitcases. Ms. Raines waited in a car, ready to block the street if the police arrived. They then drove in Dr. Raines’s station wagon to a farmhouse nearby, where, over beer and sandwiches, they pored over the documents. \"It didn’t take us long to discover we had not acted in vain,\" Dr. Raines recalled. Among the files was an F.B.I. order to interview dissidents aggressively. The bureau’s goal, the order said, was to \"enhance the paranoia endemic in these circles\" and \"to get the point across there is an F.B.I. agent behind every mailbox.\" What that proved, Dr. Raines said, was that J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director, \"was not simply into surveillance; Hoover was into taking the voice of dissent away from dissent.\" The cache also included a routine routing slip with the word \"Cointelpro.\" The burglars overlooked the document, but the Church Committee later exposed the program in detail. At dawn, Ms. Raines drove her husband to a gas station pay phone, where he called a Reuters reporter and announced that the burglary had been committed by a group calling itself the Citizens’ Commission to Investigate the F.B.I. The burglars copied the documents and sent them to Senator George S. McGovern of South Dakota and Representative Parren J. Mitchell of Maryland, both Democrats, and to The Post, The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. The Post published the story first. The gang never convened again. In 1976, the statute of limitations for burglary charges expired. John Curtis Raines was born on Oct. 27, 1933, in Minneapolis to Richard C. Raines, the Methodist bishop of Indiana, and the former Lucille Arnold. He received a bachelor’s degree in English from Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., in 1955. After earning a doctorate in Christian social ethics from Union Theological Seminary in New York, Dr. Raines moved to Long Island to serve as a Methodist minister in Setauket, N.Y. There he was recruited to the civil rights movement. As a son of privilege who had been raised by a governess in a house with five fireplaces and seven bathrooms, Dr. Raines experienced a social-conscience epiphany on a trip to the South with other civil-rights advocates in the early 1960s, when, he was thrown in jail for trying to integrate a bus station in Little Rock, Ark. \"For the first time in my life,\" he said in a 2011 oral history interview for the Temple University Libraries, \"I found myself in a space I had never been before — outside power and regarded by power as an enemy, and power had the power to punish me for that.\" During a summer break he met a waitress from Michigan State University, Bonnie Muir, who had given up cheerleading to join a group committed to improving interracial relations. They married a year later. In addition to his wife, Dr. Raines is survived by their daughters, Lindsley and Mary Raines; their sons, Nathan and Mark; a brother, Robert; and seven grandchildren. Dr. Raines was a professor of social ethics at Temple for more than 40 years, retiring in 2011. The 1971 burglary was subsumed by another break-in the following year, this one by White House operatives at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex in Washington, which set off a scandal that led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. But memories of it were revived when the Snowden leaks of national intelligence documents broke in 2013. Dr. Raines felt such an affinity for his fellow informer that he sent a copy of Ms. Medsger’s \"The Burglary\" to Mr. Snowden with the inscription \"From one whistle-blower to another.\" \"He gave shape to our story as something current,\" Dr. Raines said of Mr. Snowden, who remains a fugitive in Moscow. \"The same fight we had before was being fought again.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/obituaries/john-raines-84-who-evaded-capture-in-an-fbi-break-in-dies.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Azzedine Alaïa, Fashion’s Most Independent Designer, Is Dead at 82', 'text': ' Azzedine Alaïa, one of the greatest and most uncompromising designers of the 20th and 21st centuries, died on Saturday in Paris. He was 82. His company said the cause was a heart attack. Known as a sculptor of the female form, and worn by women from Michelle Obama to Lady Gaga, Mr. Alaïa was equally famous for his rejection of the fashion system and his belief that it had corrupted the creative power of what could be an art form. He rarely hewed to the official show calendar, preferring to reveal his work when he deemed it ready, as opposed to when retailers or the press demanded it. Instead he built his own system, and family of collaborators and supporters, and since the turn of the millennium had become an increasingly important voice for the value of striving to perfect and explore a single proprietary aesthetic, and against giving in to the relentless pressure to produce collections. \"I dressed women directly on their body, by intuition. This is how I gained experience,\" he once said. His kitchen, where he was famous for holding free-flowing lunch and dinner gatherings, for which he often cooked, was his soapbox. There he would regale guests — who could include designers, Kardashians, the artist Julian Schnabel, the architect Peter Marino and seamstresses from his ateliers — long into the night with opinions, stories and exhortations. He \"changed my conception of fashion,\" said Nicolas Ghesquière, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton, in a documentary on Mr. Alaïa made by the stylist Joe McKenna and released this year. \"I thought fashion was about embellishment as a kid, and when I saw Azzedine’s work I understood fashion was about construction and architecture too. To have an amazing idea and the capacity to realize it yourself is the definitive act of a designer.\" Diminutive in stature — at least compared to supermodels like Naomi Campbell, who called him \"Papa,\" as he was a guardian of sorts for her in Paris at the beginning of her career, and Farida Khelfa — he was always attired in a uniform of black Chinese cotton pajamas. He was famous for working long hours alone, bent over patterns and pieces of fabric, with National Geographic programs playing on the wide-screen TV nearby next to a pillar collaged with photos of friends and their families. He was also mischievous: He often lied about his age, once told a journalist that his mother was a Swedish model, and liked to hide from his staff members and then startle them by jumping out with a whistle. Prone to holding grudges, fond of animals (he had three dogs — including a St. Bernard — and eight cats), he could also be extraordinarily generous. Mr. Alaïa dedicated his life to the belief that fashion was more than just garments; to him, they were as much an element in the empowerment of women and of a broader cultural conversation. An exhibit of his work in 2015 at the Villa Borghese in Rome, where his gowns held their own among the Caravaggios and Berninis, suggested that he had achieved that goal. Azzedine Alaïa was born in Tunis, Tunisia, on Feb. 26, 1935 (though some biographical sources list his birth year as 1939 or 1940). He had a twin sister and a younger brother, and his father ran a wheat farm outside the city. Azzedine became interested in art and design at a young age. \"I was helping Madame Pinot, a midwife that helped in giving birth to my whole family,\" he recalled in an interview with the fashion magazine The Ground in 2011. \"I told her that I liked to draw. She gave me books, pamphlets to art exhibitions, and my first book of Picasso.\" Soon she registered him at the School of Fine Arts in Tunis, he said, \"against my father’s will.\" He also found a job in a small dress shop. \"The owner was looking for someone to finish up the dresses,\" he said. \"My sister had learned sewing with the nuns, and she had a notebook with all the basics. That was my first real experience with fashion, and while I was in the shop, I improved dramatically.\" He added: \"Close to the boutique, there was a beautiful palace where two wealthy girls spent their days looking out the balcony. They saw me going in and out of the shop with cartons and fabrics, and finally, one day after school, they came up to question me about my work and invited me to their house that same night.\" There Mr. Alaïa met a cousin of the girls’ who wore Christian Dior and Balmain dresses, and through her he found work with a dressmaker who made copies of Balmain clothing. From there, with help from a well-connected friend of the cousin’s, he went to Paris, to work for Dior, in 1957. Living in the \"chambre de bonne\" of Comtesse Nicole de Blégiers, he paid his rent by making clothes for her and babysitting her children. Word spread, and he became an inside secret of the great and good of French society; clients included the writer Louise de Vilmorin, Cécile and Marie-Hélène de Rothschild, of the banking family, and the actress Arletty. He opened his own maison in 1979. Mr. Alaïa introduced his first ready-to-wear collection in 1980 and was soon hailed as \"the king of cling\" — though his garments were much more than that: He used leather and knits to shape and support the body, transforming it into the best version of itself. He eschewed external decoration for internal integrity, weaving pattern and adornment into the weft of the garment itself in ways that were almost undetectable to the outside eye. Celebratory of feminine physicality without falling into the trap of exploiting it, his work coincided with and helped create the supermodel phenomenon. His shows, rarely publicized, without any of the bells and whistles that now are now de rigueur, were nevertheless among the most influential and jam-packed. He didn’t care, and people were often kept waiting for hours until he was ready. \"He’s an artist at the end of the day, and he doesn’t have any sense of time,\" said Ms. Campbell in Mr. McKenna’s film. \"I remember [at model] Stephanie Seymour’s wedding, at the reception after the church wedding, and he was still stitching our bridesmaids dresses. He cannot let it be seen until it is completely finished.\" Though his aesthetic fell out of fashion with the advent of deconstructed minimalism in the 1990s, Mr. Alaïa never allowed himself to be distracted by the pressures of others, and by the year 2000 acolytes began returning to his atelier, a complex of buildings on Rue de Moussy in the Fourth Arrondissement, where he lived, worked and cooked (and later opened a three-apartment hotel). They were drawn by both his work and what he stood for: independent thought in an industry ruled by trend. Indeed, one of the hallmarks of Mr. Alaïa’s clothes was their timelessness; they could be worn for decades, because they were not rooted in any identifiable season. As Artforum wrote in a review of a retrospective at the Palais Galliera and Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 2013: \"The 40 decades of Alaïa’s work shown here reveals no defining trends, only an increasing interest in the refinement of technique, a kind of reverse neoclassicist ethos that lends soft flesh and airy fabric the smooth, uncanny weightiness of sculpture.\" Prada bought a stake in the business (later sold back to Mr. Alaïa), allowing it to become a force in accessories. In 2002 a number of Yves Saint Laurent’s former couture staff joined Alaïa after Mr. Saint Laurent’s retirement, including the heads of the tailoring and dressmaking ateliers. In 2007, Compagnie Financière Richemont, the Swiss luxury group that also owns Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, became a significant investor, confirming Alaïa as an industry jewel and allowing it to expand at its own pace. A perfume was introduced and store expansion planned, and by last year Mr. Alaïa had more than 300 points of sale globally. His closest collaborator was Carla Sozzani, owner of the influential boutique 10 Corso Como. Nevertheless, at a time when designers are more often called \"chief creative officers,\" and have teams of people to interpret and realize their ideas, Mr. Alaïa continued to oversee every garment, and every detail, himself, often without stopping for weekends or vacations. \"He did everything with his hands,\" said the stylist Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele in the documentary. Though he had a house in Tunisia on the sea, he rarely managed to visit, because he was always working. Beyond the runway, Mr. Alaïa created work for the ballet and the opera, began holding art exhibitions in 2004 in the space that also houses his showroom (regular programming began in 2015 with an exhibition by the Syrian poet Adonis) and was planning a bookstore. He is survived by his partner, the painter Christoph von Weyhe; and nieces and nephews. Mr. Alaïa returned to the couture calendar in July after six years. In the audience were Jack Lang, the former French minister of culture; Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, former first lady of France (and one-time Alaïa model); Isabelle Huppert, the actress; Marc Newson, the industrial designer; and Fabrice Hergott, the director of the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. Mr. Alaïa had become the equivalent of a national treasure, and everyone was there to honor him.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/fashion/azzedine-alaia-obituary.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Malcolm Young, Whose Guitar Riffs Helped Propel AC/DC to Fame, Dies at 64', 'text': ' Malcolm Young, the guitarist and songwriter who helped found the Australian rock band AC/DC, died on Saturday. He was 64. His family confirmed the death in a statement, adding that Mr. Young had had dementia for several years. It did not say where he died. Mr. Young and his brother Angus created AC/DC and played their debut show at a Sydney, Australia, club on New Year’s Eve in 1973. The group, known for its power-chord riffs, earsplitting vocals and raucous energy, found enduring popularity and great commercial success despite waiting until 2012 to release its music catalog to iTunes. \"You need to entertain\" during a live performance, Malcolm Young said in an interview posted on YouTube, so that the audience always knows that \"something’s going to happen on that stage tonight.\" The band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. \"AC/DC’s music and approach had a worn-in, scruffy vibe that stood in stark contrast to the pretentiousness suffusing much rock music at the time,\" the Hall of Fame website said. AC/DC has sold more than 72 million albums in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2016, the band was still packing arenas full of fans wearing devil horns for the \"Rock or Bust\" world tour, and belting out hits like \"Hells Bells\" and \"Highway to Hell.\" Angus Young was the only original member of AC/DC still performing that year. Malcolm Young’s last performance with the band was in 2010 in Bilbao, Spain. At the time, he was having cognitive problems but decided to keep performing during the tour, oftentimes having to relearn guitar parts that he had written, Rolling Stone reported. Mr. Young’s nephew, Stevie Young, replaced his uncle in 2014. While Mr. Young struggled with alcoholism in the 1980s, his nephew stepped in to substitute for him. \"I wasn’t brain dead, but I was just physically and mentally screwed by the alcohol,\" Mr. Young said in an interview. The band spoke with The New York Times in 2008, on the cusp of the release of \"Black Ice,\" which would eventually receive a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album. \"People say it’s juvenile music, but pardon me — I thought rock ’n’ roll was supposed to be juvenile,\" Angus Young said. \"You sing what you know. What am I going to write about — Rembrandt?\" The band won its first Grammy in 2010, for best hard rock performance, with the song \"War Machine.\" The group’s influential album \"Back In Black\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2013. On Saturday, musicians and fans shared their memories of Malcolm Young on social media. \"I had some of the best times of my life with him on our 1984 European tour,\" the guitarist Eddie Van Halen wrote on Twitter. Ben Jolliffe, of the English rock band Young Guns, wrote: \"Absolutely broken to hear of Malcolm Young passing. Grew up with the family and he was like a second dad to me.\" Mr. Young was born on Jan. 6, 1953, in Glasgow, Scotland. His parents later emigrated to Sydney. His survivors include his wife, O’Linda; two children, Cara and Ross; his brother Angus; a sister; and three grandchildren, according to a statement on the band’s website. Mr. Young’s brother George, one of the band’s producers and songwriters, died last month. The band posted a tribute to Mr. Young on its website and social media, calling him \"the driving force\" behind its success. \"As a guitarist, songwriter and visionary he was a perfectionist and a unique man,\" the statement said. \"He always stuck to his guns and did and said exactly what he wanted.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/obituaries/malcolm-young-dead.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'nyregion': [{'title': 'Judge Ruchie, the Hasidic Superwoman of Night Court', 'text': ' Just before the Jewish High Holy Days this fall, Judge Rachel Freier was rushing around her kitchen, as she perpetually is. She had just cooked a salmon dish for Sabbath dinner. She was talking to her daughter in Israel on her headset. She was at a countertop, cutting apples and wrapping tuna salad sandwiches to take to work, because at night court in Brooklyn, where she presides, there’s little to eat that’s kosher. Stepping outside her townhouse in Borough Park, Brooklyn, she climbed into her purple and white minivan emblazoned with the emblems of the female volunteer emergency medical service she founded in her ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. A trained paramedic, she keeps her medical bags in her vehicle, just in case. \"My car is like my second home,\" she said. This is Ruchie Freier, as friends call her, a 52-year-old Hasidic Jewish grandmother who has blazed a trail in her insular religious community with so much determination that the male authorities have simply had to make room. Eleven years ago, she became one of the first Hasidic female lawyers in Brooklyn, and last November, she was elected as a judge to civil court, making her almost certainly the first female Hasidic elected official in the country. She has done so not by breaking the strict religious rules that govern ultra-Orthodox women’s lives, but by obeying them so scrupulously that there are limited grounds for objection. \"I conformed,\" she said in an interview in her spacious living room. \"I just found some creative ways to extend what it means to conform.\" Along with her official duties, she serves these days as a kind of diplomat between Hasidic Jews and the secular world, explaining the realities of the courts to the Hasidim and the habits of the Hasidim to the courts. And she has also been using her public platform to warn publicly of what she sees as a grave threat to her community’s survival, an epidemic of lost youth and suicides that is driven, she believes, by an unforgiving culture of judgment among ultra-Orthodox schools and families that she feels needs to change. Last summer, she wrote a column for Vos Iz Neias, an online Orthodox news source, about Malky Klein, a Hasidic girl who had been expelled from her yeshiva and died of a heroin overdose in June. She quoted anecdotal statistics that estimate 70 Orthodox Jewish children have died of drug overdoses or suicide in the past year. \"What happened in our community; why have so many of our children been cast away — thrown overboard into dangerous and troubled waters?\" she wrote. \"We need to unite and champion true Torah values to solve our problem.\" Most Hasidic women do not pursue high-profile success in the outside world. They are taught their most sacred role is to maintain the religious sanctity of their home and raise their children. \"What a woman does in order to enhance her glory is not put herself out as an example to other people in the public domain, but rather in private, in the home,\" said Samuel Heilman, a professor of sociology at City University of New York and an expert on the Orthodox and Hasidic communities. \"The men are in the forefront, they run the world, and we are the power behind the throne,\" said Pearl Engelman, 70, a great-grandmother in the Satmar Hasidic sect in Williamsburg, who broke that paradigm several years ago by speaking publicly about a cover-up of child sex-abuse cases in the ultra-Orthodox community. Women are generally permitted to work outside the home to support their families, so long as they comport with religious rules. And Judge Freier felt she could do all that was expected of her as a Hasidic woman — and be a judge, a paramedic and a voice for change, too. \"Everyone was waiting to see, ‘What is she going to do?\" Judge Freier said of the wary attitude toward her after she became a judge. \"And I’m the same. I dress the same, I still cook and I still bake and I do whatever I always did. Whatever we consider important traditional Hasidic values, I didn’t let go. So I guess it was an eye-opener for everyone.\" \"She is a good barometer of how this community is going through a transition,\" Mr. Heilman, the sociologist, said. \"It might seem glacially slow from the perspective of the outside world, but clearly she is a sign of the growing power of women, of the impact of democracy and an open society.\" A few minutes before her 5 p.m. shift on a recent evening, Justice Freier arrived at Brooklyn Criminal Court on Schermerhorn Street. She is only 5 feet tall, and slender. She was dressed formally, with a dark wig covering her hair to meet the modesty requirements of her sect, and a tailored business suit, its skirt reaching below her knees. It was a half-hour drive from her home but a universe away from Borough Park, where men with side curls and women pushing strollers speak Yiddish on the streets. Here there were police officers and court officers in bulletproof vests. In a narrow hallway, Judge Freier conferred briefly with another female judge about a case. She was ushered into an elevator used to transport prisoners, and strode to her chambers through a warren of hallways divided by metal fences. She will pray, as she does three times a day, before she takes the bench. Her rebbetzin, a female religious mentor such as the wife of a rabbi, had given her a special prayer. \"That people shouldn’t malign me or put me in positions, or ask for things I shouldn’t do,\" she said. \"That I should make the right decisions, because we are all human beings, and don’t have any ability to see the future.\" There are precedents for what Judge Freier has accomplished, but not many. In Israel, a small group of ultra-Orthodox women have formed  a political party to run for office, despite opposition from rabbis who still disapprove of women entering public life. In 2013, a Hasidic woman in Montreal ran for a local City Council seat and won. And in the Bible, there is a female judge in the Book of Judges: Devora, or Deborah, a prophetess who calls the Israelites to battle. But there has not been a female ultra-Orthodox judge for centuries, certainly not within the Hasidic movement, which was founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe. Judge Freier recalled that her rebbetzin told her, \"If God gave us Devora, the judge, if we have that in our history, that means that Ruchie Freier should be a judge. That’s it!\" Yet Justice Freier is careful not to call herself a feminist. For her, it is a radical charge that would imply she wants to overstep and reject traditional gender boundaries. That could lead to community members ostracizing her and her family, which could limit her ability, for example, to arrange marriages for her two unmarried daughters. So she stays away from controversial gender issues. She does not want to be a judge in a religious rabbinical court, a strictly male domain that rules over many civil matters for ultra-Orthodox Jews. She does not pray in the men’s section of the gender-segregated synagogues. She does not want to wear a Tallis, a traditional male prayer shawl, as some Reform Jewish women now do. \"I wanted to succeed, but I wanted to do it from within my community,\" she said. \"I love Borough Park, I love the people here. I didn’t want to break away.\" Just after 5 p.m., Judge Freier took the bench. She would see a steady stream of turnstile jumpers, low level assault cases, drug users and order-of-protection violators until 1 a.m. A swirl of public defenders, prosecutors and police officers surrounded her. Night court is the emergency room of criminal court, a tough shift that tends to fall to new judges. On an average night in the misdemeanor part, she will arraign up to 50 men, deciding whether they should be released while awaiting trial or remanded on bail. On that evening, some cases took 5 minutes — the district attorney recommended release, and she agreed. On others, she asked questions for 20 minutes or more. Judge Freier never expected to be in criminal court. She won a seat in Civil Court. But in New York, an administrative office decides where to put judges, and she was assigned to criminal court a few weeks before she started in January. She has been nonetheless energized by the task. The New York City judicial system under Mayor Bill de Blasio is moving toward alternatives to bail, such as vocational training and supervised release, for low-level crimes. Judge Freier has embraced the trend. A young defendant came up, accused of misdemeanor assault of his girlfriend. Judge Freier inquired into his record, and found out that his past offenses consisted of stealing MetroCards and using marijuana. She reduced his bail from $2,500 to $250. Another man, obviously mentally ill, stood before her. He had exposed himself and masturbated in a Popeye’s restaurant. She took her time and decided to release him before trial with mandated mental health treatment, even though the district attorney recommended he be held on $5,000 bail. She is inspired by two things, she said later: the possibility of making a positive change for a defendant, and her own volunteer experiences within the ultra-Orthodox community counseling teenagers who had turned to drugs and other vices. She found time and time again that they were not bad children; they were just doing bad things. \"I want you to understand the importance of what’s being offered to you in court,\" she told a 17-year-old who had been charged with possession of a knife, offering to dismiss the charges if he stays out of trouble for six months. \"I want you to choose your friends, stay in school, do your schoolwork, and stay out of trouble, because you’ve got potential, but it’s in your hands.\" Judge Freier was raised in a traditional ultra-Orthodox home in Borough Park, graduating from an ultra-Orthodox high school for girls that discouraged college. Shortly afterward, she married a Hasidic man, David Freier, and became a legal secretary to support his Judaic studies. Then Mr. Freier, who is now a mortgage broker, decided to go to college so he could earn money for the family. That was already a groundbreaking decision among the insular ultra-Orthodox, where even for a man to enroll in a secular university was rare. At his graduation, Mrs. Freier remembers saying to herself, \"It’s my turn,\" she recounted in a speech to an Orthodox Union women’s group in June. Her husband agreed. Over the next 10 years, she graduated from Touro College, and Brooklyn Law School. By then, she was 40, with six children. More opportunities have opened up for Hasidic women in recent years, with some women pursuing flexible or online degrees in fields like accounting or special education, even as some ultra-Orthodox rabbis continue to disapprove of college for women. Law school, however, had little precedent. \"At every stage, everyone said, it’s never going to happen,\" she told the women’s group. Even Hasidic women have had mixed feelings about her choices. \"O.K., she’s a superwoman, Ruchie Freier, she’s great, she dresses modestly, her deportment is modest,\" said Mrs. Engelman, the Satmar great-grandmother from Williamsburg, explaining the more conservative view of her generation. \"She’s one in a million. But there isn’t this tremendous yearning to want to be like her. We think, ‘I have my career at home, I want to excel in what I am doing.’\" Yet when Judge Freier passed the bar in 2006, her first clients were Hasidic men from the ultra-strict Satmar sect, who needed help with real estate transactions and liked that she spoke Yiddish, she recalled. (Judge Freier, by marriage, is part of the Bobov Hasidic sect.) Her real estate practice grew. Still, the idea that she could parlay her experience to win a local judicial election was unthinkable. So many factors fell into place to make it happen that her oldest son, Moshe, 30, said he didn’t expect to see such a thing again in his lifetime. For one, it was actually her uncle and mentor, Judge David I. Schmidt, who held the seat she would win in her judicial district, which includes Borough Park. He retired in 2015, after his legal secretary sued him, claiming she was fired in 2014 for complaining about his inappropriate sexual comments in the office. Then her opponents in the Democratic primary both had legal trouble. The Daily News reported before the September vote that Morton M. Avigdor, who had the support of local Democratic elected officials, had misused more than $500,000 from an estate of which he was an executor. Her other opponent, Jill Epstein, a secular Jew, had been censured by a panel of judges for failing to respond to inquiries on an ethical matter. Voters \"must go with Freier,\" The Daily News urged in an editorial. She ran a spirited but careful campaign. Her Yiddish theme song, broadcast from four S.U.V.’s covered with fliers on Election Day, referred to her as Mrs. Freier, not by her first name. Her fliers didn’t feature her photograph, to avoid charges of immodesty. Her husband, not she, gathered the endorsements of 10 local rabbis, who praised both \"Mr. and Mrs. Freier\" in a letter for their good works in the community. Mr. Freier, 56, a soft-spoken man with a graying beard who jokes that he is now referred to as the judge’s husband, said that he thinks her record of service made the difference. \"They liked what she did with the ambulance service, the at-risk youth,\" he said. Of all her causes, it is the EMS service about which Judge Freier seems most passionate, perhaps because of the ongoing struggle to keep it alive. Ultra-Orthodox women in Brooklyn had tried to form an all-female emergency service since the 1980s, mostly to help women in emergency birthing situations, she said. But it never happened. Judge Freier pushed for it. In the years that she worked as an attorney in private practice, she signed up for an emergency medical technician course with her mother, who had always told her she could do anything, \"unless it’s illegal, immoral or against the Torah,\" she said. When the powerful male-run Jewish ambulance service, Hatzolah, declined to open to female volunteers at her request in 2011, Judge Freier applied for a license for a separate female EMS service, Ezras Nashim. It opened with some 20 volunteers in 2014. When local rabbis were reluctant to support it publicly, her husband went to Israel and filmed himself getting rabbinical approval from senior sages. Ezras Nashim, she said, is not about being a feminist, but about reclaiming the traditional role of women to help in their own God-given way. It is the same sentiment that drives her other work. \"We aren’t saying the men aren’t good,\" Judge Freier said. \"But there is something different about us just by the fact that we’re women. We are bringing something that you can’t give.\" The service, which she still leads as director, was recently named EMS agency of the year by the city and state emergency medical service councils. Right now, its women respond in their own cars to emergencies, and they help the 911 ambulance dispatched to the scene. But it is now applying for its own ambulance license and in the coming months will face a public hearing at which Hatzolah and other services can object. Judge Freier is girding herself for the hearing, even looking forward to it. She has been practicing what she will say. \"I want someone to look me in the face and say that religious women can’t do it,\" she said, as she drove to court in her minivan. \"I want to see who is going to have the nerve to face me and say, ‘Jewish women aren’t capable.’ I feel bad; I am going to make mincemeat out of that guy.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/nyregion/judge-ruchie-the-hasidic-superwoman-of-night-court.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The Double-Stuffed Boat to Haiti', 'text': ' Last week, Louis Spano stood on the deck of a cargo ship in Red Hook, Brooklyn, looking out over an expanse of vehicles waiting to be loaded on board. There was a Mack truck stacked high with mattresses, a few peeling school buses, two hulking pieces of equipment — parts of an old cement plant — and dozens of older model cars that, if you got close enough, you could see were stuffed to capacity with blankets, rugs, bicycles, spare tires, microwaves, packs of fruit juice, a fake Christmas tree. \"What’s the problem, Daddy?\" Mr. Spano said into his walkie-talkie as a crane lifted a truck onto the ship, the Beauforce. The problem, that day, was that the other crane wasn’t working. Shipping lines take all sorts of goods in and out of New York City. Mr. Spano, the 57-year-old owner of Red Hook Shipping Inc., specializes in shipping used vehicles from Brooklyn to Haiti. But not only cars and trucks. Haitian import rules allow used vehicles to hold personal effects and used household goods. And so, twice a month, Mr. Spano ships vehicles that are loaded with all manner of items collected by local Haitian immigrants to send to people back home, from bundles of clothes — known as pepé in Creole — to sacks of rice to crutches to pots and pans. The trucks and cars have become, in a sense, shipping containers — a practice that some criticize for having filled the struggling island nation with decrepit vehicles and junk, while others describe as a vital link — particularly since the devastating earthquake of 2010. \"People always sent stuff in the vehicles, but after the earthquake it was more, \" said E.Z. Vallon, an employee of Red Hook Shipping who oversees vehicle drop-offs and helps translate for Mr. Spano, who speaks only basic Creole. \"It was stuff they really needed.\" He added, \"They have families over there and you know things are bad for them, so you have to find a way.\" Michael Stamatis, president of the Red Hook Container Terminal, said it is up to the country importing the vehicles whether to permit them to be loaded with items. \"In other vehicles we ship to West Africa,\" he said, \"it is not allowed.\" Mr. Stamatis said he believed Haiti’s policy stemmed from \"economic hardship related to natural disasters that have occurred there.\" He added, \"I believe it is considered relief goods.\" There are nearly 90,000 Haitian-born immigrants living in New York, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey from 2015. . It is among the largest Haitian populations outside Port-au-Prince, and after the 2010 earthquake, the diaspora across the region played a role in helping rebuild the country. For years, Duperlo Nevil, who lives in Irvington, N.J., has saved money from his job as a truck driver to send things to his sister Junette. \"The last thing I sent over was some foodstuffs and some sheets,\" said Mr. Nevil, who buys space in other people’s vehicles. In Haiti, Mr. Nevil said his sister picked it up at the port. \"She liked it. She shared it with family.\" Mr. Spano charges $1,500 to ship a standard S.U.V.; larger vehicles work out to around $150 per linear foot. He figures he could charge more for the extra cargo that gets packed inside but he chooses not to. \"Let them send it,\" Mr. Spano said. \"Let them live. Things we neglect every day, stoves, refrigerators — it’s of great value to them.\" Weight is not an issue on ships like the Beauforce, which can hold thousands of tons, he explained. And so customers are free to pack the vehicles with anything that will fit, or to strap it onto the roofs, as long as the cargo itself does not violate customs regulations. \"If you knew how much I didn’t charge for, you’d think I was crazy,\" said Mr. Spano, who often finds himself trying to find space for someone’s couch or first communion gifts before closing the hatch. Mr. Spano found his Haitian calling, he said, through a twist of fate. Raised in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, by Italian immigrant parents, he started out in the pizza business. \"The closest I ever got to a ship was driving over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge,\" he said. By the late 1980s, he had given up his pizza parlors in suburban New Jersey and was running a produce store in Newark when he happened to meet a Haitian man. The man would visit the owner of a furniture store where Mr. Spano spent slow afternoons watching television.\"I would go to watch ‘Oprah,’\" Mr. Spano recalled. \"I would hear them speak another language. I asked them, ‘What are you talking about?’\" The man told him there was demand for shipping vehicles to Haiti: at the time, Haitians had to truck them to Florida. Mr. Spano offered him a job, with the idea of expanding into the Caribbean shipping business. \"I gave him a desk next to the potatoes and the onions and said, ‘Let’s see what you got.’\" The first shipment of cars was not exactly a success. \"I got annihilated, economically annihilated. I didn’t know what I was doing,\" he said. Then, in 1991, an international trade embargo was imposed on Haiti, bringing business to a crashing halt. Mr. Spano believes in learning from failure — a belief enshrined in his email handle, loserlou29 — and he did not give up. Anticipating an end to the sanctions, he started advertising on local Haitian radio, and when the embargo was lifted in 1994, business took off. \"It lit up like a match,\" he said. Mr. Stamatis, the terminal president, said Mr. Spano had been among the first in the region to ship cars to Haiti. \"A lot of people copied him. They tried, failed, walked away. It’s not an easy business.\" There have been some missteps. Once, a ship caught fire, scorching the vehicles. \"I still delivered them burned. I sat with the people and we made our deals,\" said Mr. Spano. \"Loser Lou, right?\" In 2006, Mr. Spano and an accomplice were arrested after a failed robbery attempt at a bank in Queens, and he served a one-year sentence, he said. The men tried to cut a hole in the roof of the bank to reach the vault — twice — but they were caught. \"I did turn my life around,\" Mr. Spano said. \"I did a year and a day.\" For about five years, Mr. Spano has been back in business and operating out of Red Hook. There, customers drop vehicles off in his lot every day of the week. Many are regulars who send a couple of used vehicles on every ship, then sell them in Haiti. Some vehicles have flat tires; others are totaled, or nearly totaled. Mr. Vallon, his employee, said: \"They will find something to do with it. You think something is like garbage — they’ll turn it to new.\" They also sell the precious space in the vehicles. Last week, Pierre Bonner, of East Flatbush, Brooklyn, was crouched in the back of a 20-foot box truck that he had paid to stuff with things. Around the truck were shipping barrels with names and addresses in Haiti scrawled in Sharpie, trash bins crammed with cookware, a cooler full of notebooks, children’s toys. \"Some of them are for my family, my wife’s family,\" he said. The rest was gathered from strangers. The pile appeared to be about twice the size of the truck. Mr. Bonner wedged things in, as if putting together a puzzle he’d completed before. Mr. Vallon looked on. \"When he’s finished, nothing will be outside,\" he said. \"It will all be in.\" In a similar fashion, Mr. Spano packed the Beauforce, loading up 199 vehicles — cement-plant parts included — with one crane, and going just an hour overtime. This week, the ship will reach St. Marc, a small port outside Port-au-Prince. \"Very small,\" said Andrey Efimov, the ship’s captain, who comes from Russia. He estimated that the Beauforce is about twice as long as its pier. \"I think we are biggest ship for this port.\" There are no tugboats to guide it in, Mr. Efimov said, just a small boat, and he has to follow it closely; the waters are shallow, and there is a sunken barge to navigate around. When they reach the pier in St. Marc, people swarm the ship. Thieves are not uncommon. But amid the crowd, Mr. Spano will be waiting. He flies to Haiti twice a month, sometimes bringing one of his sons to learn the ropes, to watch over every ship as it’s unloaded. He can be heard shouting in Creole. \"‘Camion’ is ‘truck,’\" he said. Mr. Spano, who ships about 4,800 stuffed camions a year, shrugs off the unusual demands of his business. \"When in Rome, you’re Roman, honey.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/nyregion/brooklyn-boat-to-haiti-stuffed-cars.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'At $3,700 a Month, ‘Affordable’ Apartments Go Begging', 'text': ' In any given week, the housing crisis in New York City reveals itself through new but familiar anecdotes of deprivation, in fresh sets of grim statistics, in staggering contradictions. Several days ago, residents of the notoriously beleaguered Louis H. Pink Houses in the East New York section of Brooklyn rallied to protest a lack of heat and hot water in the buildings, a recurring condition, they said, that left children sleeping in parkas and hats and getting sick. Not long after, a report from the city’s Department of Investigation revealed that over a four-year period beginning in 2013, the Housing Authority failed to conduct mandatory lead paint inspections in its apartments but then falsely certified to the federal government that it had, potentially jeopardizing the health of young children of more than 4,000 families. Overcrowding in apartments of all kinds is escalating as well. Among the poor, those with housing are the fortunate. During the past year the homelessness rate has been stagnant — more than 62,000 people sleep in shelters each night. Earlier this month, a study from the Citizens’ Committee for Children indicated that the number of families with children who had entered the shelter system between 2012 and 2016 increased by 22 percent and the average length of a shelter stay went up during the same period. Throughout his campaign for re-election, Mayor Bill de Blasio directed our attention again and again to his housing initiative, one committed to preserving and building 200,000 affordable residences by 2022 with an additional 100,000 units targeted for completion by 2026. Three hundred thousand units would, as his administration has pointed out, supply enough housing for the entire population of Boston or Seattle. But housing advocates have been concerned all along that the plan provides insufficiently for those facing the most severe financial challenges. In response to this criticism, the mayor, earlier this year, committed an additional $1.9 billion in capital funds to ensure that a quarter of the housing stock under the plan would go to New Yorkers with \"extremely low\" and \"very low\" incomes. Ten percent of the apartments are meant for those with \"extremely low\" incomes (a family of three earning about $26,000 a year or less, for instance) and about 15 percent are for those in the second category (a family of the same size with an annual income in the range of $26,000 to $43,000). This leaves a vast majority of \"affordable\" apartments in the hands of those who earn anywhere from 51 to 165 percent of the median income for the metropolitan area, or from $43,000 to upward of $141,000 for a family of three. Advocates maintain that the balance ought to be shifted to those further down the income chain and that the greatest need exists among those families making about $35,000. The fate of a building at 535 Carlton Avenue in Brooklyn, would suggest that they are right. The building was developed with all 300 of its units designated as affordable and available to prospective tenants through a city housing lottery. Half the apartments, though, were slated for middle-income occupants, and although the lottery received more than 93,000 applications, an inadequate number of qualified tenants in the highest income brackets has left 80 apartments empty. The developer, Greenland Forest City Partners, is now advertising them via StreetEasy, social media and so on. As it happens, 535 Carlton delivers a lot in terms of Instagram friendliness. Designed by CookFox Architects, whose work includes luxury condominiums in the West Village, it looks like the kind of place where everyone is supposed to arrive by Dutch cargo bike and ascend to well-stocked kitchens to make momentous decisions about whether or not tonight’s grain salad ought to be topped with a poached farm egg or something more adventurous. There is a gym, a playroom and a lounge, but using those spaces requires additional fees, which is likely to leave most residents getting their cardio by running up and down the stairs from the lobby. To qualify for a currently available three-bedroom apartment — the rent for which is $3,716 a month — a family of five would have to have a household income of between $129,000 and $170,000. Logic, or perhaps a pleasant knowledge deficit about the mechanics of New York real estate, would tell us that to fill the vacant spaces, the remaining apartments should simply be offered to people making a lot less money. (The city faced a similar predicament with Gotham West, an affordable development in Hell’s Kitchen that did not attract enough qualified high earners through a lottery; in that case, 224 of 432 middle-income apartments were leased through conventional means.) The way that these public-private partnerships are structured and underwritten, however, the revenue from more expensive units helps offset the rents of those apartments intended for lower-income tenants (some one-bedroom apartments at 535 Carlton, for example, cost as little as $589 a month). Developers can’t just lower the rents to accommodate demand and keep the projects financially viable. Clearly there need to be more low-income units. In Brooklyn an overload of luxury rentals already exists downtown. As Adem Bunkeddeko, who is running for Congress in Brooklyn on a housing platform, put it, there is a glut of apartments for people making $80,000. As a member of Community Board 8’s housing committee, he has listened to people bemoan the structuring of 535 Carlton. \"The main gripe is ‘this is absurd; who is this affordable for?’\" he said. \"Even the folks who came in as the first wave of gentrifiers can’t swing it.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/nyregion/at-3700-a-month-affordable-apartments-go-begging.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'How Kathy James, Citymeals on Wheels Volunteer, Spends Her Sundays', 'text': ' As a volunteer for Citymeals on Wheels, a nonprofit food provider, Kathy James spends two Sunday mornings a month delivering meals to the homebound elderly. Thanksgiving is the organization’s biggest day. For the 2016 holiday, 620 volunteers, along with 225 staff, delivered close to 21,000 meals. Ms. James, 55, who lives alone in West Harlem, spends weekends with her boyfriend, Billie Coleman, Jr., a sous-chef at New York University School of Law. SWEET TEA This is the one day where I don’t rely on an alarm, but I naturally wake up by 7:30. First thing, I make myself a cup of tea. I’m a big fan of Twinings Earl Grey and have a mug with honey and half and half. It’s a tasty start to my day. Billie’s not up until later. He works between 70 and 80 hours a week and uses his Sunday to catch up on all the sleep he missed. DRESSING FOR WORSHIP Going to church is a huge part of my life, but I don’t always make it into service. Luckily, my church, Convent Avenue Baptist Church, streams Sunday service. I could watch in pajamas, but it is church so I like to get nicely dressed in a fancy top and pants. I get to sip my tea while I’m watching, which I wouldn’t be able to do if I was actually at church. I also eat breakfast. My go-to is fruit flavored yogurt. POWER OF POSITIVITY After the online service is finished, and if I’m not volunteering, I turn on the TV and watch Joel Osteen’s sermon live from Lakewood Church in Houston. He’s an awesome preacher and always speaks about the power of positivity. He gives me a lot of courage, and I’ve been a fan of his for at least eight years. BILLIE’S BREAKFAST IN BED I love making Billie breakfast. He’s a chef, but he likes it when I cook for him. Usually, the meal is turkey sausage and Western-style scrambled eggs with tomatoes, green peppers and onions and one slice of toast with butter on one side and jam on the other. I put everything on a tray and bring it to him in bed. HAND-DELIVERED I head out to deliver meals. I pick up the meals from Goddard Riverside Community Center in two insulated bags with wheels and hand-deliver them to between 10 to 16 seniors. One bag has hot complete meals while the other bag has essentials like milk, bread and butter. The routes vary week to week so I’m always delivering to different people, but no matter who it is, they’re so happy to see me. I’m likely the only person who they have seen that day, and they appreciate the human connection. Some are healthy while others have illnesses like dementia or have limited mobility. SPIRITUAL SUPPORT  My church has another service which starts in the late morning and runs for three hours and I get back on my computer to watch what’s left of it. I’m a born-again Christian and a big believer in God, and listening to all this preaching gives me strength for the week. I’m currently looking for a job in either the administrative field or as a manager, and the search isn’t easy so I need all the spirituality I can get. HOME GYM Around 2:30, I get in a workout. I’ve created a gym in one of the bedrooms with a treadmill, a leg press, weights and a mat. Normally, I run for 20 minutes and then work one part of my body like the arms or legs. KILLER POTATO SALAD Around 5, Billie and I head out for dinner. We love eating at restaurants in Harlem. Many of the places have a lively and inviting atmosphere and serve fantastic food. Red Rooster is one of our favorites. They have great blackened catfish. We also love Jacob’s for the soul food. The potato salad there is killer. RECLINE AND WATCH Sunday night is movie night, and Billie and I like to go to the AMC on 84th Street to catch a show of whatever is playing. The theater has reclining seats that you can reserve ahead of time, and going there is a real treat. We like comedies, thrillers and dramas- anything really as long as it’s good. We get seltzer and popcorn and lie back and relax and watch. CHAT AND PRAYERS We’re home around 9 and settle into the couch and talk for a few hours. This is our time to really connect since Billie works so much during the week. Around 11:30, we head into bed. I say my prayers and read the Bible for a few minutes.

He’s often solo, since there’s not a lot of foot traffic around Joseph Rodman Drake Park, mostly trucks serving the heavy industry in the area. There aren’t even any benches, so Mr. Butler brings his own chair. Though he didn’t realize it, Mr. Butler was not completely alone. Not far from him, four feet below, lay the remains of a number of African-American slaves from the 18th and 19th centuries. \"I had no idea,\" said Mr. Butler, taking five and looking down at the grass. \"Maybe that’s why I’m attracted to this spot.\" There is no marker, but nearby is a small cemetery — gated and locked — right in the middle of the 2.5-acre park with tombstones for the owners of those who toiled on their farms. Outside the white cemetery is a sign, revised in 2014, that mentions the slaves. \"Here lie the nanny, coachman, farm laborer, wood cutter, drover, blacksmith, cook, groom, carpenter and seamstress whose unpaid labor contributed to Hunts Point’s large profitable estates.\" Philip Panaritis, the man who composed the sign — and who is largely responsible for discovering the slave burial ground in 2014 along with some local schoolchildren and teachers — has been pushing to have a separate monument placed at the site, so that casual visitors like Mr. Butler will know the history that lies below. \"We need the Parks Department to O.K. a memorial,\" said Mr. Panaritis, a retired official with the Department of Education. \"And we’d like to see the burial ground put into the curriculum, not just of P.S. 48, but in other schools as well.\" Mr. Panaritis, who ran a D.O.E. project called Teaching American History, brought the burial ground to light after discovering a black-and-white photograph from 1910, showing gravestones amid a tangle of weeds, with the words \"Slave burying ground, Hunts Point Road\" written on the back. After further research, he discovered that as many as 44 slaves had lived in the area, according to 1800 census figures, with the last burial in the 1840s. In the early 20th century, because of road construction, the burial ground was graded, probably unearthing and destroying some of the remains. He believes up to 11 slaves may still be buried at the site. In March, an archaeological study confirmed much of Mr. Panaritis’s research. Dr. Jessica Striebel MacLean, an archaeologist who conducted the study using two rounds of ground-penetrating radar, found what appears to be burial shafts and the profiles of four collapsed coffins just beyond the white cemetery, near what would have been Hunts Point Road — now simply a path. The white landowner graves are situated east-west, in keeping with Christian burial practices. The slaves would have been buried away from the masters in unconsecrated ground. Their grave orientation — north-south — suggests lower socioeconomic status. This summer parks officials met with the community and discussed possibilities for identifying the site: a digital kiosk, new seating and signs, an engraved stone marker or a plaque. Some have suggested building a visitors’ center at the site, but officials are wary of disturbing the remains with construction. The department is now working on renderings and estimated costs for various scenarios. The archaeological study was financed with $15,000 set aside by State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, with an additional $35,000 to support P.S. 48’s programs related to the project. Councilman Rafael Salamanca Jr. has also budgeted $100,000 for improvements at the site. Dr. MacLean suggests that further surveys be conducted, as well as research into who might be buried there, using documents and wills, which include the transfer of ownership of the slaves from one generation to the next. In the spring of 2016, Justin Czarka, a teacher, and his students helped Dr. MacLean with her survey. They measured the standing gravestones of the Hunt, Willett and Leggett families who settled here in the 17th century, identified the types of stones used — marble, sandstone and granite — made drawings and wrote up their own reports. \"What was great about Jessica was that she was able to bring the kids into the process and work with them,\" said Mr. Czarka, who teaches English as a second language at the school. \"The children were so actively engaged,\" Dr. MacLean said. \"And Justin used what we found as a jumping-off point for these kids to have them discuss the burial and memory traditions in their own families.\" Children at the school come from a number of backgrounds and speak English, French, Chinese, Arabic and Spanish. Mr. Czarka, who helped Mr. Panaritis found the Hunts Point Slave Burial Ground project and website, said some children suggested building an amphitheater or a stage at the site so that programs can be carried out in the park. His students have been creating a \"needs assessment,\" suggesting benches, trash cans, water fountains and new plantings — basics at most city parks that are lacking at Drake. Because the park has so few visitors, those basics have been ignored for years. Benches, some argue, will only attract a bad element. Mr. Czarka disagrees. \"It reinforces this vicious cycle,\" he said. \"If you don’t have those things, people won’t come to the park. But if they’re put in place, people will use it — for good,\" he said, glancing over at Mr. Butler, still playing his trombone.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/nyregion/honoring-a-hidden-slave-burial-ground.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The Old School of the New Age', 'text': ' Between rush-hour traffic and crowds from the nearby sports bar, passers-by could miss Quest Bookshop, a plain storefront set back from the street and wedged next to a Chinese restaurant in Midtown East. But for those looking, the pale fluorescent glow of the shop window is a beacon. Helena Miel, a middle-aged woman from New Jersey with bangles on her arms, came to Quest for a pair of protective candles. Dreamcatchers hung from the ceiling inside, the feathers swaying as Ms. Miel opened the door. \"This,\" Ms. Miel confided to the cashier as she let out a little sigh, \"is my oasis.\" Quest is an esoteric bookshop specializing in everything metaphysical. The store is a remnant of the 1970s spiritual counterculture, but also has roots that go all the way back to Helena Blavatsky, the 19th-century Russian occultist known as the Godmother of the New Age. In the 1870s Blavatsky captivated New Yorkers with her tales of sojourns to Tibet, India and Egypt, where she sought a common thread through all the world’s religions. In 1875 she helped found the Theosophical Society to further this work. \"What we desire to prove,\" she wrote, \"is that underlying every popular religion was the same ancient wisdom-doctrine.\" The New York branch of the Society moved to this block in 1952, and in 1977 expanded to open Quest. A framed portrait of Blavatsky hangs in the back. A hard-bound 14-volume set of her writing takes up a whole shelf, sitting alongside the work of more contemporary gurus. On a recent fall evening, Sofia Bonilla, a 27-year-old regular from a nearby yoga studio, came for a book about spiritual energy. Incense burned near the cash register, a thin column of frankincense and myrrh circling toward the ceiling. Ms. Bonilla has far-ranging religious interests. She ticked them off on her fingers: Shamanism, Wicca, Hinduism. Quest stocks books about these subjects and a dozen others. \"I like to learn about all of it,\" she said, spreading her hands. Ms. Bonilla held up a string of Buddhist beads hanging around her neck. \"These help with my meditation,\" she said. Tarot and astrology readings are held in the back; two muffled voices emerged from behind a curtain there. \"I want to focus on my work and I want to get over him,\" a woman said. \"He’s like a snake,\" the man who was counseling her said. \"He’s all over the place. It doesn’t matter what he thinks.\" Two women working in fashion arrived at Quest after work. Shaelon Smith, a 30-year-old seamstress from Brooklyn, led her friend by the arm toward a section devoted to healing stones. A massive chunk of quartz sat on a table, next to piles of smaller pebbles. \"Said by mystics to help with emotional cleansing,\" read a notecard next to a tray of green stones. \"I spend a little too much money here sometimes,\" Ms. Smith confessed. She comes every payday and buys crystals by the handful. \"I put them under my pillow,\" she said. Alexander Sprinkle, an 81-year-old hairdresser from Queens stopped at the shop on his way home from the salon. Mr. Sprinkle joined the Society more than 20 years ago and said the learning never ends. \"It’s a vast study,\" he said. \"It helps to have some camaraderie on this search.\" The store’s manager, Lyn Trotman, stood behind the register, ready to answer questions from shoppers. Recently, one woman complained about a particularly hostile workplace. What could she do about a mean boss? Another said malevolent spirits were haunting the walls of her home and tearing at her body during the night. \"We don’t laugh at anyone,\" Ms. Trotman said. \"We listen.

Ms. Davis has been a New York City Police Department crossing guard at the same location — the southwest corner of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 145th Street in Harlem — for more than 40 years. \"This is my corner,\" Ms. Davis said, looking out over the meeting of the two broad, busy streets. \"I’ve never heard of any other crossing guard covering the same corner that long.\" Ms. Davis oversees her crosswalks on weekdays during the school year. She meticulously records her three shifts a day — morning, lunchtime and afternoon — in a leather-bound log book that is as much a part of her uniform as her yellow safety vest, white gloves and cap. She is one of the most senior of the roughly 2,400 crossing guards that help pedestrians navigate New York City intersections, primarily around schools. The job requires the grit to stand up to honking hordes of motor vehicles, and the tenderness to deal with the walking public, for an hourly wage that ranges from $12 for rookies to $14 for veterans. Ms. Davis is vigilant against cars trying to turn recklessly into the crosswalk and is especially attentive to talkative teens and oblivious little ones. She often dispenses a hug and a symbolic push toward the curb. A Harlem resident herself, Ms. Davis lives two blocks away from her post, and has trained most of the other local crossing guards. \"You can see this is a busy corner, so they stick the new ones with me and I show them the ropes,\" she said. \"My sergeant brings them down their first day and after a day they’re on their own.\" It’s no surprise that Ms. Davis seems to know most of the people who pass by her. \"She’s a neighborhood institution,\" said Kevin Dukes, 61, who lives nearby. \"To a lot of us, she’s like a second mother. Everyone knows Ms. Davis.\" It’s a social job, and can take a physical toll, sometimes. \"I say hello to hundreds of people a day, and sometimes I get so tired, I just hold up my hand,\" she said. \"I get grown-ups who I used to cross when they were kids and now I’m crossing their kids, or even their grandkids. On my birthday, people give me gifts.\" Ms. Davis said she was born 1933 in Orangeburg, S.C. \"I grew up on a big farm, working in cotton fields,\" she said. \"We didn’t need crossing guards there.\" She said she moved to Manhattan as a young woman and worked for years in a hat factory in Greenwich Village. After it closed, she became a crossing guard. Ms. Davis said she was a widow with six children, 11 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren. There are a lot of young relatives for her to enjoy, but she has a rule. \"I don’t babysit,\" she said. \"Not unless there’s an emergency.\" She prides herself on rarely missing work, even in the worst weather. \"If I miss one day, these kids will have a fit,\" she said, adding, \"If I sat up in that apartment all day, I’d be just as nutty as a fruitcake.\" She sings with the choir at Greater Emmanuel Baptist Church on East 118th Street. She passes slow moments during her shift humming church songs. One day, she said, she will return to the family farm down south. \"When I do retire, my sergeant said they’re going to put my name up on a plaque here on my corner.\" On a recent weekday, she said hello to a neighborhood resident, T.J. Jeter. \"She uplifts everybody she comes in contact with,\" Ms. Jeter said. \"She could have retired years ago, but she’d rather make a difference on this corner. From generation to generation, everybody knows her. She’s stepped into fights and riots and calmed things down just by giving people a look.\" At one point, Ms. Davis calmly guided a group of children through a tangle of vehicles blocking the crosswalk, and then returned to the sidewalk with an energetic dance step and her arms swinging. \"I got nothing but energy,\" she said. \"I’m still out here because I love it. Why else are you going to work the same corner for 40 years?\" Finishing her morning shift, she hooked her white gloves onto her belt and somehow noticed a young boy stepping into the busy street behind her. \"Oh no,\" she said. \"Back on the sidewalk, baby.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/nyregion/40-years-crossing-guard-harlem.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The Dark Side of the Black Walnut', 'text': ' The windblown leaves of a large black walnut tree on a rainy afternoon looked just enough like palm fronds to remind me of a Winslow Homer watercolor. However fanciful, this was not the tree’s only parallel to a coconut palm. Large walnuts pelted the ground all around me with audible thuds. I was here to collect a small bag of these nuts, but I proceeded gingerly, with one eye fixed on the great tree’s canopy. I’d seen what these cannonballs (the size of limes) could do to a car’s hood, and didn’t plan on suffering a similar pummeling. Fortunately, the rich, water-soaked soil at the base of the tree was littered with the fragrant nuts, and I would be in the danger zone only a short time. Though wild black walnut (Juglans nigra) is delicious, its defenses thwart all reasonable efforts to get at it. Under the thick outer hull lies a yet harder inner shell to breach, and once within that, the nut’s brainlike convolutions render it almost impossible to extract in any large quantity. One method often recommended in the past was to drive a car over them. Apparently, flat tires and bulletlike projectiles were common enough that most modern nut enthusiasts have turned to more surgical means of extraction — like large wooden mallets. It should be noted that the walnuts sold in cans in the supermarket are English walnuts, which are not native to New York City. Fortunately, my goal was to collect only the nuts’ outer husks. Beautifully fragrant and green when first collected, walnuts season to an incomparable, deep, brown. These can be rendered into a rich, dark brown ink that is a draughtsman’s dream. I’d hoped to share this autumn ritual with my young daughter. Down deep, I harbored the hope that she might give up her vats of glitter-slime just long enough to appreciate something more organic. Walnuts have always been prized by humans. The dark brown wood of the tree is hard, durable, and relatively easy to work. And though the nut is an absolute ordeal to extract, it provided valuable food for Native Americans and settlers alike. Walnut trees were also planted for their spreading canopy, which, at maturity, shaded both houses and yards. In the wild, these trees prefer rich, well-drained soils, and are often found near river bottomlands or creeks. Brewing black walnut ink is not difficult, and drawing or writing with the rich ink and a steel tip pen magically conjures autumn, no matter the season. The simplest recipes for walnut ink are basic. Boil peeled husks of about eight nuts in roughly a quart of water in a large pot (cast iron will make the color even darker) until the liquid attains the desired richness. Then, let the fluid cool a bit and strain repeatedly through cheesecloth. The resulting liquid can be used as is, or refined further with a little gum Arabic. The addition of vinegar or alcohol is often recommended to prevent the ink from spoiling. One cautionary note: In my experience, nothing but time removes walnut-ink stains, so use gloves and use care, or you’ll have to go to school, as my daughter did, with more than glitter-slime under your nails.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/nyregion/nyc-nature-black-walnut.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'arts': [{'title': 'John Adams Writes a New Opera, and It’s a Western', 'text': ' SIERRA CITY, Calif. — The fragrant firs had given way to jagged, rocky peaks, and the composer John Adams climbed a vertiginous metal staircase to a fire lookout high atop the Sierra Buttes, an aerie perched 8,587 feet above sea level. \"All this was heavily mined,\" Mr. Adams said, surveying a seemingly serene landscape of glacial lakes and Ansel Adams evergreens that had once been torn apart by frenzied prospectors during the Gold Rush. \"There were shafts into the interiors of the mountains.\" These days Mr. Adams is mining some of the real-life tumult that churned beneath the oft-mythologized surface of the California Gold Rush of the early 1850s — the ethnic tensions, ugly bursts of nativism and brutality toward women — for his latest opera, \"Girls of the Golden West,\" which will be given its premiere Nov. 21 at the San Francisco Opera. The opera’s mid-19th-century setting (its title archly evokes Puccini’s more melodramatic \"La Fanciulla del West,\" or \"The Girl of the Golden West\") is a departure for Mr. Adams, whose pathbreaking operas \"Nixon in China,\" about a 1972 presidential trip, and \"The Death of Klinghoffer,\" his still-controversial exploration of a 1985 hijacking, were so contemporary that some critics initially sniffed that they were \"CNN operas.\" But Mr. Adams said that the new work, with a libretto assembled from historic texts by Peter Sellars, his longtime collaborator, had come to feel disturbingly of the moment — especially its scenes of white miners whipped into anti-immigrant frenzies. \"They all came here looking for gold,\" he said at one point during a drive through the Sierras along State Route 49, which links many of the old mining sites of the 49ers. \"And when it became not so easy to find gold, they all started sounding like Donald Trump.\" It was particularly jarring, he said, to write the opera’s climax — in which a Mexican woman is lynched — against the backdrop of the 2016 presidential race. \"I kept hearing ‘Lock her up!’ at those horrible rallies,\" Mr. Adams said, recalling news footage of Trump supporters chanting for Hillary Clinton’s imprisonment being shown as he wrote choruses for his opera’s angry mob. Three decades after the premiere of \"Nixon in China,\" Mr. Adams can fairly stake a claim as America’s most prominent composer. This onetime enfant terrible has grown into an elder statesman. This year, leading orchestras around the world celebrated his 70th birthday; over the past decade, three of his operas finally reached the stage of the Metropolitan Opera; and earlier this month, the Berlin Philharmonic, which made him its composer in residence last season, released a lavish boxed set of his works. But for all that, Mr. Adams — a thoughtful, wryly funny man who lives in Berkeley, about 200 miles from here, and could easily be mistaken for one of that college town’s professors, or ex-hippies, or both — still worries about what classical music should be, how to get it to speak to audiences that now flock to other art forms, and what his role is in its changing ecosystem. He has had a small rustic cabin here in the Sierras for decades (large swaths of \"Girls\" are practically set in the neighborhood) and, as he wrote in his 2008 memoir, \"Hallelujah Junction,\" the region’s gilded past has sometimes struck him as a troubling metaphor. \"From time to time when driving in the High Sierra I’ll see amateur gold miners, panning in a river that 150 years ago gave up the best of its treasure to the first prospectors,\" he wrote, \"and I’ll be tempted to wonder if the image of these latter-day panners, hoping only for a tiny nugget, isn’t an illustration of my own predicament as a composer.\" It is a predicament that Mr. Adams has long grappled with. Early on he turned away from the sometimes chilly modernism of the 20th century — which, at its most extreme, wore its indifference to popular tastes as a badge of pride — and embraced harmony, rhythm, unabashed emotion and flashes of humor. He explored minimalism alongside composers such as Terry Riley, Philip Glass and Steve Reich — weaving shimmering, textured tapestries out of the pulsating repetition of small elements — but later found it confining and tried to incorporate it into a broader language. (He has compared it to Picasso leaving the strictures of Cubism behind.) His palette is constantly evolving — synths here, saxes there, chugging arpeggios, swelling strings, Bachian choruses, echoes of Wagner or Beethoven or jazz or rock. Along the way he developed a voice that remains recognizably his own through the constant changes. The landscape, and the idea, of California loom large in the work of Mr. Adams, a transplant from New England who found his composer’s voice in the Bay Area after making his way west in an unreliable Volkswagen Beetle in 1971. He previously explored its facets in pieces like \"The Dharma at Big Sur,\" which evokes the Pacific Coast of Jack Kerouac, and \"City Noir,\" which suggests the seamy Los Angeles of a Philip Marlowe. With \"Girls,\" he and Mr. Sellars have returned to its earliest days — the dark underbelly of part of America’s creation myth. Songs have been on Mr. Adams’s mind these days, and he tried his hand at becoming a tunesmith for the new opera. While \"Girls\" has big, operatic set pieces — there is an aria based on Frederick Douglass’s powerful \"What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?\" and a rollicking instrumental interlude for Lola Montez’s scandalous \"Spider Dance\" that has already found success in the concert hall — Mr. Adams has also written new music for a series of old miner’s songs that Mr. Sellars has included in the libretto. (Mr. Sellars said in a telephone interview that Mr. Adams had written \"unforgettable earworms\" that he cannot get out of his head.) And he aimed for a mostly sparse, lean sound for his Western opera. \"How can you tell this story in a more modernist, complex language?\" he asked. \"I think it would be ridiculous.\" For all his past success, though, Mr. Adams said that premieres still make him nervous. \"I just don’t know what it’s going to be like — whether I’ve made an aesthetic wrong turn or not,\" he said at one point during the hike down from the Sierra Buttes. \"We live in this strange era where we’re still sort of having this spasm back and forth out of modernism and into something new,\" Mr. Adams said. \"And then somebody will come up with something that’s really a more modernist creation, and it will be a success, and I’ll think ‘Oh God, I’m not relevant anymore.’\" He even raised the possibility that \"Girls,\" which San Francisco commissioned and produced along with the Dallas Opera and the Dutch National Opera, could be his last large-scale opera. \"I think if I do another theater piece, it’s going to be small,\" he said. The \"Girls\" project began when Teatro alla Scala in Milan asked Mr. Sellars to direct a new production of Puccini’s \"Fanciulla del West.\" The Puccini opera features ravishing music, Italian operatic drama, and a sometimes pulpy libretto based on a David Belasco play that raises modern eyebrows when its Native American characters greet each other with \"Ugh.\" Mr. Sellars passed. But he approached Mr. Adams about creating their own Gold Rush opera based on existing sources. Some opera buffs have bristled at their title’s wink at the Puccini opera, especially after Mr. Adams confessed in an interview that he does not really know it. But Mr. Adams’s work has long engaged with composers of the past — and he has written his share of allusive titles, including \"Scheherazade.2,\" a symphony for violin and orchestra whose title evokes Rimsky-Korsakov’s \"Scheherazade,\" and his orchestral work \"Harmonielehre,\" which took its title from a book by Schoenberg, a composer he was actively breaking from. Much of \"Girls\" is drawn from the letters of Louise Amelia Knapp Smith Clappe, a New Englander who lived in the mining camps with her husband, a doctor, in 1851 and 1852, and published them under the pen name \"Dame Shirley.\" It also incorporates bits of Mark Twain’s writings; Shakespeare, whose work was often performed for miners; and others. This collagelike approach — which Mr. Sellars has used since he took over the lyric-writing duties from Alice Goodman, who wrote the librettos of Mr. Adams’s first two operas, \"Nixon\" and \"Klinghoffer,\" — has been controversial. It solves one problem: By using existing texts, it answers the sometimes distracting question of what a new opera in English should sound like. But some critics have found it lacking drama or poetry — which Mr. Adams rejects, saying he prefers them to many other recent librettos, which remind him of television scripts. Philip Glass, America’s other leading opera composer, once described himself as an \"image composer\" and Mr. Adams as a \"word composer,\" Mr. Adams recalled. \"I think he was right,\" he said. \"Although he sets words, the main thing for him is the image he’s thinking of. And for me it’s the word — not only what it says, but also the rhythm and the sound.\" For \"Girls,\" Mr. Adams found himself composing the history of a stretch of California where he has had a rustic cabin for decades. Staying there earlier this month with his dog, Amos, he woke up to find his car’s doors wide open and his passenger seat shredded by a bear. \"A bottle of beer in the trunk had popped open from the altitude and he or she was apparently furious not to have been able to get to it,\" he wrote in an email. \"And Amos? Slept through it.\" The opera’s climax takes place a short drive away in Downieville, an old mining town that was the home of one of the most infamous episodes of the Gold Rush: the lynching of a Mexican woman who was hanged for killing a white miner who had broken down her door the night of the very first Independence Day celebrated by the new state of California in 1851. That is how the composer found himself with a date with an ex-sheriff. When Lee Adams, a former sheriff of Sierra County and a local history buff, heard that \"Girls\" would dramatize the hanging, he reached out to Mr. Adams, offering to show him around Downieville, where the local paper, The Mountain Messenger, still prints the price of gold in each edition (it was $1306.99 that week). They met at the Downieville Museum, in a former Chinese store that was said to have offered gambling and opium in the back. The ex-sheriff explained that people there still argue about the hanging. Its details are hazy: contemporary accounts gave the hanged woman’s name as Josefa, which is what the new opera calls her, but she was widely remembered later as Juanita. And it is unclear what took place between her and the miner she stabbed: It is generally agreed that he broke down her door, but whether he assaulted her is uncertain. But what happened next still shocks: She was tried before an angry mob and hanged on a bridge — all in the course of a day. \"I have no idea if she was at fault, not at fault, whatever,\" Mr. Adams, the former lawman, said. \"The bottom line is, she did not get a legal trial.\" Not that the onetime sheriff is exactly squeamish about hanging: He led the effort to restore Downieville’s historic gallows, and his license plate reads \"Hangman.\" Mr. Adams took a walk to a bridge near the spot where Josefa was hanged and read a plaque which gave her last words as \"I would do the same again if I was so provoked.\" \"I’m not too keen on this,\" he said, growing serious as he visited the scene of his finale. \"To me it’s like a tourist attraction. And I’ve lived with this in my mind for so long.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/arts/music/john-adams-opera-san-francisco-girls.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Alia Shawkat on Growing Up and Gaining Control', 'text': ' Little Dory Sief, the amateur sleuth of TBS’s \"Search Party,\" is all grown up now, and so are the mysteries surrounding her. \"The first season was Nancy Drew, about searching for something and finding yourself through it,\" said Alia Shawkat, who plays Dory. \"And now it’s more like Hitchcock, where she’s doubting everything she sees or feels and doesn’t know who to trust because everything she thought was real isn’t.\" (The show returns on Sunday, Nov. 19.) In Season 1, Dory — a doormat of a personal assistant on a quest for meaning — took her Brooklyn brat pack on a wildly convoluted hunt for Chantal (Clare McNulty), a college classmate who had disappeared and was presumed dead. Among the finale’s revelations: Chantal was alive in Montreal, oblivious to the chaos her absence had caused. And Keith (Ron Livingston), the private detective Dory hooked up with in the belief that he was working for Chantal’s family, had met his bloody demise. Or had he? Charmingly forthright and smokey-voiced, Ms. Shawkat, 28, spoke about Dory’s future, her roles in \"Transparent\" and \"Arrested Development,\" and sexual harassment in Hollywood. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Now that she has located Chantal, where should we expect to find Dory? The most interesting shows are when you watch an evolution of the character. Dory started off very lost. Her kindness was misinterpreted for weakness. Then she discovered something that she was good at, that she cared about because she thought it was helping other people. She’s been so blindly self-obsessed that she didn’t realize she’d alienated those closest to her. So, in the second season, she’s unveiling that she’s not what she thought she was. \"Search Party\" has been called one of the most realistic portrayals of millennials on TV.  Millennials definitely think that they’re doing something for somebody else, when it’s actually just a selfish act. The show’s main characters are kind of despicable people, and at the end, Dory realizes that she’s actually the worst off. And I think they’re relatable because the creators Charles Rogers and Sarah-Violet Bliss write as if they’re people they’ve known for a long time, where you know their worst qualities but still really care about them. In Season 4 of \"Transparent,\" you play a sex addict in a three-way with Sarah and Len. You’ve said you like being naked onscreen. Honestly, I don’t think it’s going to get any better physically. I’m at my peak. But yeah, if it’s right for the story, then it completely makes sense to me. In the work I’ve done, I’ve communicated what I want it to be and set up safe environments. There’s so much power in a naked woman’s body. And that’s how you reclaim being naked in front of someone — because it’s not about how people are going to look at me, it’s about how I feel in my body. The season also takes the Pfefferman family to Israel, and Ali visits Ramallah in the West Bank. Weirdly, art very much mimicked life with that show. I come from an Arab family; my father is Muslim, and so I have grown up always pro-Palestine. Right before reading the script for \"Transparent,\" I decided to visit Palestine, and I stayed in Ramallah. It was a lot of young, amazing, vibrant artists actively talking about the situation but then laughing in the next breath. When I got back and we read these scripts, I was like, \"This is insane.\" Jill [Soloway, the show’s creator] gives so much to Jewish faith, but she made such a beautiful point without demonizing Israel. A fifth season of \"Arrested Development\" will come out on Netflix next year. You originated the role of Maeby Fünke half a lifetime ago. Maeby is in many disguises this time around. And the whole family is back together a lot more, which has been fun. Michael Cera and I talk all the time about how we’re literally standing on the exact same sets, in the same position, as when we were 14. You’ve acted since you were 8. What do you make of the allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein and the subsequent ripple effect? It’s not just a ripple effect, it’s an earthquake. It’s a restructuring so powerful and raw and upsetting. It feels like a personal war. I’ve looked back at times I thought I had under control, where I now go, \"I should have said something instead of laughing it off.\" Now I don’t feel nervous to call somebody out and say, \"That’s inappropriate.\" Especially in the comedy world, a lot of inappropriate things fly. And I was always the funny girl in the group, but still the girl, and never considered as funny or able to keep up. And I don’t care about the opinion of some guy, like Woody Allen’s let’s not make this a witch hunt. You say that as like, \"Let’s be chill.\" And I’m like, \"[Expletive] be chill.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/arts/television/alia-shawkat-search-party-transparent.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Your Week in Culture: ‘Nutcracker,’ James Levine and Christmas Scripted by Charles Dickens', 'text': ' New TV shows, museum openings, film releases and concerts — it’s a lot to keep track of.

Perhaps the greatest disappointment of the Metropolitan Opera’s 2017-18 season was the company’s decision to cancel a new production of Verdi’s \"La Forza del Destino\" by the visionary, controversial director Calixto Bieito, in an attempt to cut costs. At least its replacement will sound a somber note in memoriam: The company’s emeritus music director James Levine will make a rare appearance to lead four concert performances of Verdi’s titanic Requiem. A star team of soloists — Krassimira Stoyanova, Ekaterina Semenchuk, Aleksandrs Antonenko, and Ferruccio Furlanetto — will join Levine and the Met orchestra and chorus in bringing to life the composer’s hyper-dramatic funeral mass, written to honor the death of the patriotic Italian novelist Alessandro Manzoni. WILLIAM ROBIN Through Jan. 7; lct.org. It comes as a shock, in the final scene of Sarah DeLappe’s dazzlingly fierce and funny debut play, \"The Wolves,\" when one character mentions another by name. Until then, we know them all — nine teenage girls, members of an indoor soccer team called the Wolves — only by jersey number: 7, a bullying alpha, reckless with her talent; 25, the team captain, unironic in ordering the ladies to circle up; 46, the newbie, excruciatingly awkward and, in Tedra Millan’s beautifully nuanced performance, exceptionally endearing. The chance to spend time with them again is reason to celebrate the return of Lila Neugebauer‘s kinetic production. Seen Off Broadway twice last season, it’s in previews at Lincoln Center Theater, where it opens on Monday, Nov. 20, with almost the entire original cast. A finalist for this year’s Pulitzer Prize, \"The Wolves\" is perfectly attuned to this moment — taking for granted that young women are whole human beings, and aware that not everyone sees them that way. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES Nov. 20; acorn.tv. Last year — after a career playing the effervescent sidekick in \"Extras,\" \"Ugly Betty\" and \"Catastrophe\" — the Scottish actress Ashley Jensen glammed up in fuchsia lipstick and a matching leather jacket for a long-overdue lead as a London publicist turned Cotswolds sleuth in \"Agatha Raisin,\" an original series from the streaming site Acorn TV. Alas, a second season wasn’t to be. But Acorn’s programmers, bless ’em, are back on Ms. Jensen’s bandwagon with \"Love, Lies & Records,\" starting Monday, Nov. 20. Co-produced with BBC One (it debuts a few days earlier in Britain), the six-part drama stars Ms. Jensen as a registrar in Leeds, where she invariably summons precisely the right words for life’s big moments — births, deaths and marriages — while bumbling through her own relationships, hampered by an office indiscretion and a blackmailing colleague. Kay Mellor, who was inspired to create the show after registering her own mother’s death, has called it \"anti-Brexit,\" centering story lines on same-sex marriage, immigration and transgender struggles.

With the exception of three years in Tokyo in the late 1960s, Truitt (1921-2004) spent her working life in Washington, D.C.

It was the fourth time in five years that Ms. Moeketsi, the deep-voiced 23-year-old daughter of a platinum miner from a tiny village in South Africa’s Eastern Cape, had tried out to play Rafiki, the oracular mandrill, in \"The Lion King.\" She had stood in line for open auditions with hundreds of other hopefuls, and waited by the phone for callbacks that never came. She had mastered English (her first language is Sesotho) and memorized \"Circle of Life\" (she can’t read music). She had claimed a dormitory roof-deck here as her makeshift rehearsal room — a space where she could sing to the sky, without bothering her neighbors. Finally, on the last day of May, Ms. Moeketsi found herself in front of a row of folding tables occupied by \"The Lion King\" global brain trust, including the show’s award-winning director, Julie Taymor, and, hovering anxiously along a wall, Duma Ndlovu, the South African casting consultant. \"Nants’ ngonyama,\" she belted out, silencing the room with the Zulu lyric that has become the show’s signature sound. \"Bakithi baba.\" Over the last two decades, 263 South Africans, many with little formal training in singing or acting, have been dispatched all over the planet to \"Lion King\" productions staged in Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese and Spanish. Ms. Moeketsi was determined to be next. \"I want to perform,\" she said a few days later, sipping tea at a burger joint behind the storied Market Theater, long a center of anti-apartheid art, and now, in a South Africa where for many the struggle is economic, renting rehearsal rooms to Disney. \"I want to write. I want to save enough money so I can build a theater that’s close to my village. That’s my dream.\" According to Disney, the musical — about Simba, a lion cub finding his way after the death of his father — has earned more money than any other title in entertainment history. Since opening on Broadway in 1997, it has been seen by 90 million people in 24 productions that have collectively grossed $7.9 billion. Adapted from a hit animated film set in the fictional Pride Lands, the stage adaptation is rooted in South Africa by its music, much of it by the composer Lebo M., using South African languages and choral stylings. Almost every cast — and there have been many — has included eight to 12 South Africans among approximately 50 performers. \"I felt very strongly that we had to have South Africans in it from the beginning,\" Ms. Taymor said in Durban in June. She was there for a round of auditions, which continued through the summer, to assemble a largely South African-cast tour that will begin in Manila next March and then set out across Asia. This month the show celebrated its 20th anniversary. When Ms. Taymor and Thomas Schumacher, the president of Disney’s theatrical division, were developing it two decades ago, they helped persuade Actors’ Equity to allow for a contingent of South African performers; now every year Disney teams visit Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town to cast more. \"It’s like the spiritual foundation of ‘The Lion King’,\" Ms. Taymor said. The life is hard — performers, generally young adults, leave their parents, and often their children, behind, often relocating to countries where they don’t speak the language. But there is adventure to be had, art to be made, money to be earned. That’s why Ms. Moeketsi, who grew up in a home without electricity, listening to news on a battery-powered radio and hoping to one day become an announcer, started auditioning. She had moved from her village to Johannesburg for college, and, as she wrapped up her studies at the University of the Witwatersrand, she saw \"The Lion King\" as her best hope, professionally and financially. She was seeking to join a generation of South African performers who have landed jobs in the musical. Some have found new homes, new families, new careers. Others have struggled to translate the opportunity into sustained success. All have been changed. The gangster’s wife is worried.

At the same time she and a language adviser on headset are quibbling about how best to phrase \"Where is your shirt?\" in Zulu. It’s a long way from Pride Rock. Ms. Mhlongo, 38, is a \"Lion King\" success story — a grateful alumna who parlayed a stint with Disney into a significant television career back home. She now stars on \"Generations: The Legacy,\" South Africa’s second-most popular soap opera, or soapie, playing a nurse married to a mobster. Along the way she faced years of unemployment and a spiritual crisis. But her journey illustrates the possibilities for \"Lion King\" performers who spend years on stage overseas and then try to continue working in the arts back home. \"I knew I would come back, because I wanted to make my name in South Africa,\" Ms. Mhlongo said. Filming was over; breathless after a quick wig-and-costume change, she apologized that her typically fashionable character had been dressed casually for the late-night living room scene. Ms. Mhlongo, who grew up in KwaMashu — a township north of Durban where black people were resettled during apartheid — was a teenage mother when she first saw the animated \"Lion King,\" and discovered that watching the video soothed her baby daughter. (They would skip the sad stampede scene.) She spent years performing with K-Cap (KwaMashu Community Advancement Projects), an arts program founded and led by her husband. But by 2007, when she learned that Disney was holding auditions in Durban, she was ready for a bigger stage. Although many South Africans, like Ms. Moeketsi, try out year after year, Ms. Mhlongo was hired on the spot to play Rafiki in \"Festival of the Lion King,\" a 30-minute revue, at Hong Kong Disneyland. She left a 3-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter to be raised by her husband. While there she had another stroke of good fortune: She was spotted by a vacationing Disney executive who recruited her to join the \"Lion King\" production that has been running in Germany for 16 years. But Ms. Mhlongo only lasted three months in Hamburg, before she left the show, citing \"spiritual sickness.\" Rafiki is the one principal part regularly played by a South African woman. Inspired by a sangoma, a type of South African faith healer who, according to belief, can channel ancestral spirits, the character was troublesome for Ms. Mhlongo, as it has been for other South African women, because she felt at times unable to manage dark feelings she believed the ancestors were surfacing. (Some productions keep sage and other herbs on hand as antidotes.) She recovered — \"I had to fast and pray, and at home they had to do a lot of ceremonies\" — and her career resumed. She performed in the ensemble, while understudying Rafiki, in Johannesburg and on Broadway, and then played the role on tour in North America. The show spoke to her, and to other performers, in inspirational ways — in particular, its story of a dispossessed leader spending years in exile before returning to reclaim his kingdom strikes many as having thematic echoes of Nelson Mandela. The show also resonates personally and painfully. As the lionesses ululated in mourning over the death of Simba’s father, Mufasa, Ms. Mhlongo would think of her own father, who was stabbed to death in Johannesburg when she was 13. \"When I listen to the eulogy, it’s like I’m talking to my ancestors. I’m saying, ‘Why, why did you take him?’ ’’ The peak, she said, was originating Rafiki in Spain when that production opened in 2011. The transition was jarring: there was the night her brain froze and she accidentally began a song in German. But the gig went well, and she even won some awards for the yearlong engagement. \"After that I told them, I’ve reached the ceiling,\" she said. She returned to South Africa in 2012, and, other than a brief 2013 fill-in stint in a North American tour, has been here since. \"I struggled to find work when I came back,\" she said. \"It was hard to crack.\" She now encourages other \"Lion King\" hopefuls, in part by helping her husband, Edmund Mhlongo, whose K-Cap program, independent from Disney, prepares high school graduates to audition for \"The Lion King,\" as well as more generally for careers in the arts. Students there all know whether their vocal range and body type make them more likely to be a Nala or a Rafiki, a Simba or a Mufasa, and each year they learn the audition songs, which they perform a cappella, in English, although Zulu is their primary language. Over the years, about 20 alumni have landed roles in the musical. For Ms. Mhlongo, whose face is painted on the side of the center alongside those of others trained there, the show offers a rare chance to explore the world, and the arts. \"‘Lion King’ is a university,\" she said. The house \"The Lion King\" built is gone. Thandazile Soni, the first Rafiki in Chicago, now lives in a wooden shack on a former sugar cane field southwest of Durban, down a rutted dirt path that descends as the houses become ever more ramshackle. Hers is the shabbiest — a makeshift three-room shed, with a corrugated metal roof held in place by stones, curtains to keep out critters and climate, cocks crowing and children playing in the dirt yard. There are no beds for the kids, and only a hot plate for cooking. When it rains, the structure floods; when the wind blows, everyone shivers; and when the sun beats down on that roof, they sweat. This is not the life Ms. Soni dreamed of. Not the life she worked for. Not the life she had. She has been in \"The Lion King,\" off and on, since she was 25. Now she’s 43. Ms. Soni, who goes by the nickname Thandi, was, in effect, a migrant worker in the global economy. She traveled around the world to work for Disney, moving so often she can’t remember all the cities, leaving behind children to be raised by relatives, wiring money back to support as many family members as she can. She struggled, physically and psychologically. But now she wants back in, for a simple reason — her family needs the money. \"I just want to save like there’s no tomorrow and then come back home and build for my kids,\" she said. She was seated on a twin bed in the tiny room she shares with her 10-year-old son; a jaunty straw hat sat atop her head. Pausing repeatedly to look away, catch her breath and wipe her eyes, she described herself as humbled and humiliated: \"I’ve been trying to see how on earth did everything get to this point, but trying to look back is not going to fix it.\" She left the show in the summer of 2016, hoping to take care of a college-age son who had had some kind of psychotic break while she was away. But she quickly lost a house she had purchased with her early earnings, and they wound up moving into the shack. Most of her belongings are now in storage, but just below her journal, she keeps a copy of the script and the score. Just in case. Her life story, as she tells it, is one of unrelenting woe. Raped at 10 by a neighbor, she gave birth to a child who was given to another family. A runaway at 14, she led a life she doesn’t like to detail. \"It was bad for a girl child,\" she said, rolling up her pants to show scars on her legs from a South African bullwhip called a sjambok. She was raised during the height of the struggle against apartheid, as repression and protest convulsed the country and severely limited the rights and opportunities for black South Africans. But she always had one escape — music — and she perked up as she recalled discovering that people admired her voice. \"I would find every chance I got to run away from home, go sing somewhere,\" she said. \"And then I would come back, they would beat me up a little bit, but then I’d be fine, cause I did my thing.\" As a young adult, she sang backup vocals for other artists, and joined a gospel group called the Durban Divas. For her first Disney audition, in 2001, she sang \"What Shall I Do,\" a gospel number by Tramaine Hawkins, and nailed it. The casting directors kept her for hours. Could she sing higher? Lower? Be Rafiki? Nala? Then her life changed. \"Do you have a passport?\" Lebo M., the composer, asked her. \"I didn’t even know what a passport was,\" she recalled. She was off to Denver, in the ensemble of a new national tour, and then a year later to Chicago, as Rafiki. She told her mother to buy that new house, and paid tuition for her siblings. But she also struggled, with depression, and with vocal issues. She worked in London, Hong Kong, and back on the North American tour. She had a baby (her fourth, cared for by her mother when Ms. Soni is away). She lost her voice again. She cycled in and out of the show. \"At night I tell myself, this is our waiting area, this is where we are waiting to go to our Canaan,\" she said, waving her hand around the home she likens to a tomato box. \"I want to get out so bad.\" So last spring she was back in a rehearsal room near Durban, auditioning again. The Disney team had a whispered conversation. \"It’s a positive turnaround, given what she’s been through,\" said Anthony Lyn, a supervising resident director for the show. Ms. Taymor was obviously moved. \"I love her,\" she told her team. \"I think she is amazing.\" And now, unable to make ends meet without \"The Lion King,\" Ms. Soni is going back out on the road. She didn’t get a role in the new international tour, but she did get an offer to join the ensemble in Scheveningen, a North Sea resort in the Netherlands. She is studying \"Circle of Life\" once again — this time in Dutch. Mduduzi Madela has been two kinds of antelope, an ostrich, half a wildebeest, half a rhino, and one leg of an elephant. He has sung bass, baritone and tenor. He has played a menacing hyena, and a leonine prince. For 14 years, since he was a scrawny 21-year-old, he has been crisscrossing America and Europe in \"The Lion King.\" Now he’s on Broadway, covering the role of Simba, which means that he periodically gets to perform a leading role. He is one of 36 South Africans who have made it to the Broadway cast over the last two decades; one ensemble member, Lindiwe Dlamini, has been with the show from the beginning. But what lies ahead for a South African artist who has spent his entire adult life on Pride Rock? Ms. Mhlongo found fame. Ms. Soni found hardship. Mr. Madela, who uses the nickname Mdu, is wondering what he’ll find. \"Already, I’m itching,\" he said in June in Umlazi, the Durban-area township where he grew up, during a two-month leave from Broadway. \"What next?\" He has a dream: he wants to be a music producer. He also has Ananelwe, his 2-year-old daughter — an American citizen, born of his relationship with another \"Lion King\" ensemble member, Nteliseng Nkhela — and he knows the child’s life will be affected by where they choose to live. Early this month, he found himself talking about constructing a post-show life with a group of \"Lion King\" alumni after a boisterous 20th anniversary performance that brought Elton John, one of the show’s composers, back to its stage. This spring, Mr. Madela brought Ananelwe with him to Umlazi, and arranged for a Zulu ceremony, introducing her to her extended family and, symbolically, to her ancestors; she received a goatskin bracelet, called an isiphandla, that she wears around her wrist. \"This is what I wanted her to experience — being barefoot, somewhere in Umlazi, without being in an apartment in West New York, N. J., where there’s no yard to play at, and we have to say, ‘No, don’t jump that much, because there’s a neighbor underneath who’s going to complain about the noise’,\" he said. He imagines dividing his time between the two countries, aware that many alumni of the show don’t return to South Africa, but also mindful of opportunities in the United States. \"When it comes to stability, and earnings, you get to do things that normal people do — you purchase a house, you take your kids to good schools — the very things that people aspire to,\" he said. \"But ‘The Lion King’ gets the cream of the crop when it comes to singing, and many people wind up staying where they are.\" Mr. Madela took to music early. His father, a production manager for a French electronics company, had a guitar, which he taught himself to play. His aunt gave him a keyboard; he learned that too. He wrote his first song at 12 — a love song, in Zulu — and then, under the tutelage of a high school teacher, he began reading about the songwriters Diane Warren and David Foster, and writing his own pop songs, now in English. \"The only thing I knew about ‘The Lion King’ was the movie,\" he said. \"I didn’t know there was a musical.\" But he was young, and adventurous, so when he saw an ad in a local newspaper, he auditioned, and then when a woman with a thick Dutch accent who could not pronounce his name called to offer him a job in Scheveningen, he said yes. His studies could wait. Paris, Las Vegas, the North American tour, the British tour. He saw the world. He learned to dance. He became fluent in a language he thought he would never learn — French. Finally, New York called. Broadway. \"I thought, ‘You know what? You have to be a fool to say no,’ \" he said. That was four years ago. To fend off restlessness, he takes classes and writes pop, gospel and R&B songs, and he has registered a company in the United States to publish and license his material, mostly in South Africa. \"It’s been such a beautiful, beautiful ride, and I’m grateful,\" he said. \"But I look at my daughter, and I think, I need to do more.\" Fumane Moeketsi, the 23-year-old university student who auditioned this spring, grew up on folk tales, filled with songs about hunters and giants and bears, told by relatives gathered in her family’s rural home. So when she first heard Mr. Ndlovu, the South Africa-based casting consultant, explaining the story of a lion cub exiled after his father is killed by his uncle, she was smitten: \"I want to do it,\" she said. So she auditioned. And auditioned. And auditioned. This year, her fourth, was the first time she met Ms. Taymor, and she had 12 minutes to make an impression, to sell herself as a possible Rafiki. She was nervous — sweat beading on her forehead — but ready, beaming and forceful as she began. When she sang in African languages — the show’s lyrics include words in Congolese, Sotho, Swahili, Tswana, Xhosa and Zulu — her voice was clear and sharp. But in English, her voice seemed to tremble. She rolled her R’s. Her enunciation seemed effortful. \"Try and eliminate some of the vibrato,\" said Clem Ishmael, the show’s global music supervisor. \"It’s very classical sounding,\" Ms. Taymor added. She did not mean that as a compliment. But they asked her to read a scene — the first time she had ever progressed that far — in which Rafiki tries, literally, to knock some sense into Simba. Again, Ms. Taymor heard something in Ms. Moeketsi’s tone she didn’t like. \"You sound like the most luxurious sex doll,\" she cautioned. \"Rafiki is an old baboon.\" This was progress, and Ms. Moeketsi knew it. The team was now training her. \"Find the rhythm and percussion — play with the musicality, and enunciate on the consonants,\" Ms. Taymor said. \"You understand what we’re talking about.\" And then, as Fumane turned to leave, Ms. Taymor added one more word. \"Beautiful.\" Two callbacks followed, and then the phone call Ms. Moeketsi had been craving for five years. Did she want to join the new international tour, in the ensemble and understudying Rafiki? \"My mother was in tears when I told her,\" Ms. Moeketsi recalled. \"She said, ‘I know you’re going to work hard to make sure everyone at home is taken care of.’\" She plans to return to her village one more time before departing, when she expects a sheep or a chicken to be slaughtered for a family feast, thanking the ancestors and asking for their help with a safe journey. And in Johannesburg, she is planning a party at which she will photograph advice her friends write on a whiteboard, \"so if I feel things are becoming tough, or I’m struggling, I can read the messages to encourage myself, and remind myself where I come from.\" Later this month, she will fly to Manila for a costume fitting, and then in January, she will begin rehearsing there. She expects to be in the show through 2020. That’s when the tour is due to reach South Africa.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/theater/the-lion-king-south-africa.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Making (and Seeing) Dance in the Politicized World', 'text': ' A woman stands onstage, hunched over in what looks like a bulky snowsuit, the outer shell of many layers soon to be revealed. In a meticulous undressing, she peels away items of clothing, pulling a yellow sweater over her head like taffy, nesting her legs in a stretchy blue shirt on her way to taking it off. This is the opening of Beth Gill’s exquisite and enigmatic \"Brand New Sidewalk,\" which I saw in its New York premiere at Abrons Arts Center in September. Wide open to interpretation, the solo, danced by Danielle Goldman, is on one level about nothing more (or less) than color, shape and texture. Yet in Ms. Goldman’s metamorphosis, I also found a potent, if oblique, political statement — about a woman’s control over her body and her subversion of any expectations we might have for it. At no moment could you say with certainty, \"This is who she is,\" because she never stopped transforming. In watching dance this fall, while rounding the corner of the first anniversary of the 2016 presidential election, I’ve been struck by the political resonance not only of Ms. Gill’s work, but of, well, just about everything. Even dances with no obvious agenda have seemed like quiet protests, simply by virtue of staking a claim to space, time and the attention, amid so much urgently vying for it, of the people gathered to watch. Dance didn’t suddenly become political in the span of one tumultuous year. It always has been, and it can’t not be: Being rooted in the body, dance is never abstract, try though it might to elude meaning. A body’s race and gender (or perceived race and gender), for instance, are layers of content in themselves. Ambiguous by nature, often without the clarity imparted by words, dance lends itself to political readings even when it might not intend to. And how it reads depends on who is reading, on each viewer’s lenses of identity and experience. You may not see what I see; I may just be noticing what you’ve seen all along. Yet the political dimensions of dance seem especially pointed right now, at a time of heightened discussion about the privileges afforded some bodies and the risks that burden others. However overt or subliminal, intended or accidental, these dimensions rise to the surface, whereas at another time they may have rested beneath it. I wondered how choreographers were thinking about the politics of their work and if, in the year since the presidential election, their creative approaches had shifted at all. So I spoke to a few who have presented new pieces this fall: Tere O’Connor, whose \"Long Run\" opened at Bard College in October; Jasmine Hearn and Mariana Valencia, who recently shared an evening at St. Mark’s Church; and Ms. Gill. They have little in common other than working within lineages of postmodern dance, in which artists have long been attuned to the political implications of their medium. Ms. Gill’s geometrically rigorous work is often described (including by her) as formalist or abstract, but in \"Brand New Sidewalk,\" an hourlong triptych, she took her crystalline minimalism in a new direction. \"Each section feels much more politically engaged and self-aware than past work of mine,\" she said in an email. Ms. Gill selected dancers and began creating \"Sidewalk\" before the 2016 election, and as the turbulence of national politics intensified, so did her interest, she said, in \"shaping and tuning the political intent of the work.\" That tuning had to do, in part, with what she calls \"smudging or blurring representations of race.\" In the past, she noted, she had worked almost exclusively with white women like herself, close to her age (she’s 36), two of whom return in \"Sidewalk\": Ms. Goldman and, in a closing solo, Maggie Cloud. The central section is a serene, measured duet for two African-American dancers in their early 20s, Joyce Edwards and Kevin Boateng. The duet unfolds in almost eerie unison, with the dancers looking nearly identical in streamlined hooded uniforms. If it reads as cautious, that may stem from Ms. Gill’s careful thought about the range of associations any movement can call up. Whether finessing how an arm coiled into the body or a progression from standing to lying down, she sought to play with \"notions of whiteness and blackness,\" she said, without embodying stereotypes. \"Often this meant altering the quality, pathway or timing of a gesture, in order to disrupt and confuse its reading,\" she said. Just the choice to pursue a dance career can constitute a political act. Ms. Hearn, 28, said that as a queer black woman, she comes to her work with a history \"of being told to be your smallest and most quiet self.\" The decision under those circumstances to \"make some noise and actually take up some space — I think that’s political,\" she said. And while the election didn’t alter the broad trajectory of her work, which often poses questions about race and sexuality, it did prompt her to break \"this habit I had of apologizing for what I was doing.\" \"We don’t have time to play around anymore,\" she said. With \"shook,\" presented by Danspace Project, she set out \"to hold a space for black women to not be doubted,\" she said. Together, she, Dominica Greene and Angie Pittman held that space in a dreamy, unrushed way, as if suspended in the sprawl of a summer evening — a tacit rejoinder to the anxieties of the outside world. Ms. Hearn’s work appeared on the same program as Ms. Valencia’s witty and melancholic \"Yugoslavia,\" in which the self-described \"first-generation Latina queer American,\" who was raised by her Guatemalan mother and her Polish stepfather, investigated the Eastern European side of her (nonbiological) family history. \"What does it mean for someone who isn’t Polish to tell that history?\" said Ms. Valencia, 33. \"My body is representing this thing that isn’t technically expected to be connected to a body that looks like mine.\" \"Yugoslavia\" splices monologue with song and dance, including, most memorably, a kind of joyless aerobics routine inspired by footage from a girls’ dance school in the former Yugoslavia. The girls, Ms. Valencia said, were rehearsing \"these very devotional dances\" to perform for the dictator Marshal Josip Broz Tito. Ms. Valencia noted that in the year since the election she has felt a stronger imperative \"to say something, really anything, that’s transgressive and productive.\" \"Part of this exercise in looking to socialist Eastern Europe was asking, What other hard realities were there?\" she said. \"What are we repeating? Is there any kind of solace in another version of strife to see ours in relationship to?\" For Mr. O’Connor, 59, the ambiguity of dance is itself politically significant. \"Exclusively binary readings of things, which are such a problem in our politics right now, are not available in dance,\" he said. \"Everything is up for multiple readings by various groups of people who will be watching it.\" And while his lush, convoluted works — including \"Long Run,\" for eight dancers — never set out to convey a particular story or political message, he doesn’t view them as apolitical. \"The work is made of politics — it’s made of response to the personal and larger community politics that are happening on earth,\" he said. \"It’s not a depiction of that; it’s a result of it.\" Though the past year hasn’t fundamentally changed his choreographic process, he does sense its influence in \"Long Run.\" \"There’s a real nervous motor underneath this dance, driving its structural conceits, and that’s definitely absorbed from the moment I’m living in,\" he said. \"There are a lot of places where the dance looks ungoverned, like the inhabitants are coming up with the next step by themselves.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/arts/dance/making-and-seeing-dance-in-the-politicized-world.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '‘Call Me by Your Name’: A Love Story Fueled by Strangers’ Chemistry', 'text': ' WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. — \"You’ll be meeting in the man cave,\" the publicist said, pushing open the door to the ground floor of a villa set in the lush gardens of the Sunset Marquis. Previous hotel guests have included members of Aerosmith, Guns N’ Roses and Metallica, and while they might never have visited the man cave, it seemed to bear homage to them, or to hair metal, or to hetero teenage boys, or to something. It had a pool table, a guitar, plenty of booze, a framed print of a nude body-painted woman, and another of a skull enveloped in flames. Darkened windows kept out the California sun. By any measure, it was a curious spot to interview Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer, the stars of \"Call Me by Your Name,\" due Nov. 24, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story about two young men who fall in love during an idyllic sunlit Italian summer decades ago. Arriving at the cave moments later, Mr. Chalamet and Mr. Hammer took in the décor with a few chortles, and then Mr. Hammer beelined to the guitar and began strumming, as Mr. Chalamet threw himself onto a big L-shaped couch. The pair have fallen into an easy camaraderie that extends most places they go. For a good chunk of the film’s shoot last year in northern Italy, and in the days leading up to it, they were often the only ones who spoke English, which helped them forge a connection that crackles through their scenes. They have also been promoting the film together, on and off, since its triumphant premiere earlier this year at Sundance, where it sent festivalgoers into a swoon. \"It’s gotten to the point,\" Mr. Hammer said, \"where we finish each others’ ——\" \"—— sentences,\" Mr. Chalamet chimed in. \"Sandwiches,\" Mr. Hammer replied. In the film, which is based on the 2007 novel of the same title by André Aciman, Mr. Chalamet plays Elio, a whipsmart 17-year-old American-Italian who lives with his family in an Italian villa, and Mr. Hammer plays Oliver, a 24-year-old American graduate student who arrives to intern with Elio’s professor father for the summer. Elio is immediately intrigued by Oliver, and soon finds himself torturously in love, and fruitlessly trying to fight it, at least at first. Set in 1983, and directed by Luca Guadagnino, whose previous films include last year’s \"A Bigger Splash\" and \"I Am Love\" (2010), the film is languid and intoxicating, a visual feast of dappled light, polo shirts and era-appropriate songs, from the Psychedelic Furs and the soundtrack to \"Flashdance.\" Mr. Guadagnino is a master at hitting all five senses, which is one of the reasons critics have warmly embraced the film. \"It is more a terrarium of human experience, a sensory immersion that is remarkably full in its vision,\" Richard Lawson wrote  in Vanity Fair. He continued, \"Each shot is busy with existence, but Guadagnino does not overwhelm.\" What also makes the story quietly remarkable, especially for a film that has traction in the awards race, is that it is simply about two young men who fall for each other, without menacing rednecks wanting to pulverize them or a ravaging disease lurking in wait. \"It’s just a love story, and it’s really humanizing,\" Mr. Hammer said. \"No one gets beat up, no one gets sick, no one has to pay for being gay.\" Though the lovers’ age difference has drawn some attention, the film has largely been a source of deep gratification for its key players. It represents a return to the screen for James Ivory, 89, who wrote the screenplay with echoes of his 1987 love story, \"Maurice.\" It is making a name for Mr. Chalamet, who is 21 and strongly tipped for an Oscar nomination. And for Mr. Hammer, 31, the time spent making the film in Italy was, he said, \"the most transformative experience\" of his professional life. \"I’ve never experienced total immersion like that,\" Mr. Hammer said. \"I’ve never experienced a sense of safety like that. I’ve never experienced a sense of making yourself so accessible and vulnerable.\" He added, \"It opened my eyes to a whole new sense of understanding, and life, and what it is to be human.\" He and Mr. Chalamet were cast separately and did not set eyes on each other until they met in Italy, on the set. Mr. Guadagnino said he felt so deeply connected to each actor individually \"that I took it for granted they must have a great connection too.\" Mr. Guadagnino found Mr. Chalamet \"ingenious,\" ambitious and intent on challenging himself in roles, he said, adding, \"He never goes for the easy way. He goes the very complicated way.\" And the director had been angling to work with Mr. Hammer since the actor appeared as the Winklevoss twins in \"The Social Network\" in 2010. \"He carries a sense of infectious seductiveness to him, and a buoyancy, and a beauty,\" Mr. Guadagnino said. \"But it is also intertwined with a very beautiful internal turmoil.\" He was proved right with the actors’ chemistry — their characters’ attraction is shot through with a fraught competitiveness — even though Mr. Chalamet and Mr. Hammer are as strikingly different in person as they are onscreen. \"It was the luck of the universe, or something, that there was just a natural bond as humans,\" Mr. Chalamet said. Mr. Chalamet is slight and pale, a bundle of boyish energy and birdlike alertness, with a delicate face topped by a black tumble of curls. He grew up in Hell’s Kitchen, the son of a former Broadway dancer and a French editor, attended LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, and appeared in \"Homeland,\" \"Interstellar\" and the Off Broadway play \"Prodigal Son.\"  Mr. Hammer is 6-foot-5, with Ken-doll features (\"the textbook guy for shaving-cream commercial looks,\" noted GQ), a sardonic mien, and a voice that booms with assuredness and authority. His great-grandfather was an oil tycoon, and he grew up in the Cayman Islands and Los Angeles. He said he wanted to be an actor after seeing \"Home Alone,\" when he was 12. Mr. Chalamet, who also appears in  Greta Gerwig’s new film, \"Lady Bird,\" said he was drawn to the role because it felt like \"an honest look into a young person’s existence.\" \"Nobody knows me,\" he said, with a laugh, \"so it didn’t feel like too much of a risk because it didn’t feel like my performance in this sort of piece of work was being compared to anything else.\" Mr. Hammer had greater trepidation, and was not sure if he was good enough for such a stripped-down, emotionally honest film, with no set pieces or special effects. \"This movie lives and dies in the moments between these characters,\" he said. There was also a lot of nudity in the original script, though it was revised, and Mr. Hammer, somehow, had never done a sex scene. He is also a relative newcomer to smaller-budget films. After his appearance in \"The Social Network,\" he landed major roles in movies like \"The Lone Ranger\" (2013) and \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" (2015). But Mr. Hammer found the box-office expectations stifling and the Hollywood machine depressing. \"It was like, ‘He’s tall, he’s conventionally handsome, so let’s put him in these big movies and try to build this brand,’\" he said, \"and it just didn’t work.\" He resolved to make smaller films, and his first one was last year’s \"The Birth of a Nation,\" which ended up being bittersweet for him, too. The drama, about Nat Turner’s slave rebellion, sold for a record $17 million at Sundance, but was engulfed in controversy after decades-old rape allegations against the filmmaker and star, Nate Parker, emerged. It was a crushing experience that Mr. Hammer said he was still recovering from. \"It seemed clear-cut to me that there was a lot of atoning and apologizing that needed to happen that just didn’t,\" Mr. Hammer said, his voice catching. \"And that was really tough because we watched this movie that we did, that we all felt was important, just kind of drift away.\" (The film’s fall did not dent his career, and while promoting \"Call Me,\" Mr. Hammer was also filming \"On the Basis of Sex,\" a movie starring Felicity Jones as Ruth Bader Ginsburg.) In the meantime, both men say they have been relishing promoting this film, even if some reactions come from left field, like a tweet by the actor James Woods suggesting the age difference between the characters was pedophilic. \"Didn’t you date a 19-year-old when you were 60?\" Mr. Hammer wrote back, in a tweet that went viral, to his great surprise. (Mr. Woods began dating a 19-year-old when he was 59.) \"I didn’t think anybody really cared what I said, I didn’t think anybody cared what James Woods said, you know?\" Mr. Hammer said. Mr. Guadagnino said any chatter about the age difference amounted to an \"artificial topic.\" No one took issue with the age difference in the 1987 film \"Dirty Dancing,\" he pointed out, where Jennifer Grey was playing a 17-year-old and Patrick Swayze’s character was 24. Also in \"Call Me,\" he said, it is Elio who goes after Oliver. \"The person who chases is 17,\" he said. Mr. Hammer recalled another surprising reaction. \"Someone mentioned to me: ‘Timothée has to put his hand on your crotch in the movie. How did that feel?’ And I was like, do you ask every woman in a movie how it is to have her ass slapped, or her boobs fondled? It’s that double standard kind of thing.\" Mr. Chalamet interjected, \"I’ve been very encouraged by the nature of the conversations that I’ve had, and by the lack of questions that are tunnel-visioned in their understanding of sexuality and life and love.\" Mr. Hammer said, \"Because the reality is, Timmy grabs my crotch all the time.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/movies/timothee-chalamet-armie-hammer-call-me-by-your-name.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'It’s Time to Talk Turkey About Thanksgiving Films', 'text': ' In these ultra-anxious times, we might find ourselves looking ever more forward to the happier times of year. That may be why the Hallmark Channel started advertising its coming Christmas movies well before Halloween, let alone Thanksgiving, and is showing them now. As we know, late November through December is the time of year when we all get together and argue about whether \"Die Hard\" is a Christmas movie or not. (I used to assert that of course it was, but now I recognize that position as perverse.) Right now we still have Thanksgiving to get through, which led me to thinking, is the Thanksgiving movie a thing? The movie I most associate with Thanksgiving is the 1933 original of \"King Kong.\" The film itself has no thematic connection to the season, but on Thanksgiving Day the New York television station WOR/Channel 9 aired it every year without fail. As a movie-mad youngster I lived for this broadcast. I got even more excited when the station added \"Son of Kong\" and \"Mighty Joe Young\" to the mix and, as I got into my teens, Japanese monster movies like, yes, \"King Kong vs. Godzilla.\" (My memory is such that I might be conflating movies that played the day after Thanksgiving with those that played on the holiday proper, but it is a four-day weekend after all.) Soon enough, the adults in the room had tired of indulging me and took back the television to use it as God intended on Thanksgiving, which is to watch football. Football. Maybe that’s a reason Thanksgiving movies might not be a thing. The late 20th century delivered two bona fide Thanksgiving movies that are now old enough to consider classics — but are they good enough? The first, \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles,\" is a 1987 comedy from John Hughes, starring Steve Martin and the great, much-missed John Candy, about an extremely odd couple of businessmen who find themselves teamed up against their will in a breakneck run to make it to their respective Thanksgiving dinners. The movie is streaming — supposedly — on the app of the cable channel Starz. I normally gain access to this app through my cable provider user ID and password, but when I tried to watch the film that way on my iPad, a black screen and a message, in a very elegant typeface, appeared instead: \"First, a quick piece of business: While you now have access to tons of your favorite stuff, this title isn’t offered by your provider. We’re confident that you’ll find more of the obsessable series and movies that you crave.\" Let the subscriber beware. I was able to watch \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" on Starz through Amazon Channels, and remind me to cancel that subscription before my seven-day free trial runs out (oops, too late now). The movie is brisk and consistently funny, and it hits the sentiment bone in a smart, relatively honest way. The slow-burn rage of Mr. Martin against the oblivious amiability of Mr. Candy (his character’s signature line: \"The last thing I want to be remembered as is an annoying blabbermouth\") remains a spectacular comedic blend. As is customary with films written and directed by John Hughes in the 1980s, there’s an American class-analysis subtext that holds the characterizations together: Mr. Martin’s aspirational hauteur is the irresistible force bulldozing into the immovable object of Mr. Candy’s just-folks awkwardness. The language is still super-salty even by today’s standards, so it might not be fun for the entire family. The second, \"Home for the Holidays\" (1995), is something that looks like it ought to get by on its cast alone: Holly Hunter, Robert Downey Jr., Anne Bancroft, Charles Durning, Geraldine Chaplin and Claire Danes. Not to mention Dylan McDermott, Cynthia Stevenson, and Steve Guttenberg cast against type as an uptight in-law. As it happens, the movie, directed by Jodie Foster, has got even more going for it. While you wouldn’t want to call it prescient, Ms. Hunter’s character, Claudia, an artist turned restorer, is the kind of career-challenged bohemian whose status remains relevant today. Mr. Downey’s frenetic gay brother is also refreshing in his nonstereotypical quirkiness. The family-is-almost-all-we’ve-got theme is a little pat but not totally cringeworthy. It’s a smile-inducing sit, rated PG-13 and free to stream on Amazon Prime. Some pictures that are not entirely set on Thanksgiving but are popular for their funny Thanksgiving scenes include the not-entirely-good teaming of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in \"Grumpy Old Men\" (1993) and \"Funny People\" (2009), which features Adam Sandler giving a doozy of a Thanksgiving toast. (\"Grumpy Old Men\" is available free for Hulu subscribers, and both films can be rented or purchased via Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Microsoft and Fandango Now.) If you’re not in the mood to watch all of \"Funny People,\" there’s a clip Fandango put up on YouTube. (It’s good, but not quite as trenchant as the short film of William S. Burroughs’s \"Thanksgiving Prayer,\" also on YouTube and definitely not family fare since it, for instance, gives \"thanks for a country where nobody is allowed to mind his own business; thanks for a nation of finks.\") When I’m inclined to recreate my Thanksgiving movie reveries of old, well, I cannot tell a lie: I will go with my nice Blu-ray Disc of the 1933 original of \"King Kong.\" The movie is still enough of a classic that there’s nowhere you can stream it free (legally). But you can rent or buy it from Amazon, iTunes and the other usual suspects. If you’re a premium member at Warner Archive, that streaming service offers the agreeable not-quite-sequel \"Son of Kong,\" featuring the great beast’s far-less-terrifying-but-still-engaging offspring. \"King Kong vs. Godzilla\" has yet to hit streaming services, but several ’60s Japanese monster movies, from \"Godzilla\" itself to the definitively odd \"War of the Gargantuas,\" have just landed in the aforementioned Starz app, although, again, if you’re going through your cable provider, you might not be able to access them. In which case, there’s always football. Or not. I’ve seen the hashtag #Noirvember turning up on social media, a casual push to make the chilly month of November into some kind of ideal time to indulge in film noir. Picking up on this, the Tumblr of streaming services FilmStruck posted a list of over 40 films on the site that make the noir grade. Among them are Otto Preminger’s immortal \"Laura\" and a few Kurosawa pictures. (Yes, the Japanese master did noir too.) Check out his 1949 crime drama \"Stray Dog,\" with a young Toshiro Mifune playing a detective who gets his gun stolen, drawing him into a seamy postwar underbelly of Tokyo. Happy grimly fatalistic viewing!', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/movies/its-time-to-talk-turkey-about-thanksgiving-films.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A New ‘She’s Gotta Have It’: Spike Lee’s Feminist Breakthrough', 'text': ' \"As a sex positive, polyamorous, pansexual,\" Nola Darling, the 27-year-old heroine of Spike Lee’s new television series, \"She’s Gotta Have It,\" boldly declares in the fourth episode, \"words like monogamy have never even seemed like a remote possibility.\" If Nola’s admissions sound strangely familiar, it’s because her character is both vintage and millennial. She originally appeared in Mr. Lee’s feature film debut of the same name over 30 years ago and now updated as a Netflix dramedy, whose 10-episode first season arrives on Thanksgiving Day. Billed as a \"seriously sexy comedy\" in 1986, the movie revolved around Nola’s romantic relationships with three men — the poetic and overly possessive Jamie Overstreet, the narcissistic Greer Childs and the unemployed hip-hop aficionado Mars Blackmon (played by Mr. Lee). A budding artist living in Brooklyn, Nola was, Mr. Lee noted at the time, \"a young black woman who’s really leading her life like a man, in control, with three men dangling at her fingertips.\" He continued, \"That paradox is funny, it’s really crazy.\" In a television landscape in which African-American female characters on shows like BET’s \"Being Mary Jane,\" HBO’s \"Insecure\" and ABC’s \"Scandal\" unabashedly establish their sexual freedom by having multiple male partners — or, in the case of Netflix’s \"Master of None\" and OWN’s \"Queen Sugar,\" also have several female ones — Nola’s sexuality no longer feels comedic or unconventional. It feels right at home, just one part of a young, black, female artist’s identity. The surprising result: Spike Lee has made his most feminist heroine yet. Critics have long noted Mr. Lee’s \"woman problem.\" In 2009, during the 20th anniversary of Mr. Lee’s most celebrated film, \"Do the Right Thing,\" the journalist Teresa Wiltz observed, \"When it comes to his female characters, it’s as though Lee can’t decide whether to worship them or punish them.\" Of \"She’s Gotta Have It,\" the feminist writer Bell Hooks wrote an even more trenchant criticism. \"Men do not have to objectify Nola’s sexuality because she objectifies it,\" she wrote. \"In so doing, her character becomes the projection of a stereotypical sexist notion of a sexually assertive woman — she is in fact not liberated.\" In the past, Mr. Lee often challenged such characterizations of his work. In my interview with him about \"Chi-Raq,\" his 2015 adaptation of Aristophanes’ classic satire \"Lysistrata,\" he asked me if I actually watched the movie when I posed the question of how women could stage a sex strike without the threat of assault. In an interview earlier this month, Mr. Lee was less defensive. \"I’m 30 years older, and the world has changed,\" Mr. Lee said. \"I think that Nola’s character is such a strong character. She is a woman who is juggling three men, and I think there are more women like that now. But the way those women are judged hasn’t necessarily changed as far as men go.\" The move to television — and having 10 30-minute episodes to play with — has also contributed to the evolution, allowing Mr. Lee to flesh out Nola (played by DeWanda Wise with an alluring mix of charisma, vulnerability and confidence). \"We shot ‘She’s Gotta Have It’ in 12 days in summer of 1985, and it was 86 minutes,\" he said. \"This thing cost millions and was a 63-day shoot. We have a much bigger canvas, and a bigger canvas gave us more time and more resources to show Nola Darling, a struggling artist today in gentrified Fort Greene.\" And with television came a writer’s room, one that Mr. Lee filled with African-American female artists and writers, including his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, whom Mr. Lee credited for conceiving the film as a series. (Besides several children’s books, including \"Please, Baby, Please,\" which recast Mars Blackmon’s humorously desperate plea to Nola as a parental appeal to an inexhaustible toddler, this is the couple’s first major project together.) \"Nola is a female character created by a man. In the process of making a show, that became even more apparent,\" said Ms. Lewis Lee, who is an executive producer on the show. \"So we added female voices to put the meat on the bones of this female character, and there would be moments where Spike was like, ‘I don’t understand what you guys are talking about.’ ‘That’s because you’re a man, and there are things you can’t see as a man, as open as you try to be. So listen to us, and let us help you.’ And he did.\" One conversation in particular stood out to her. It involved the scene in which a slightly inebriated Nola, after spending the evening hanging and drinking with her best friend, Clorinda, stumbles down the street to her home. \"As a woman looking at that, it’s very different, you recognize that real vulnerability that you feel,\" Ms. Lewis Lee said. \"And sometimes men don’t see that.\" Of the eight writers credited, four are women — Radha Blank, Eisa Davis, Joie Lee (Mr. Lee’s sister) and the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage (\"Ruined\" and \"Sweat\"). And their involvement has altered the depiction of Opal, a lesbian character who Ms. Hooks previously described as \"predatory.\" \"Times have changed,\" Ms. Nottage said. \"And Opal appears in a very different way now. Opal offers Nola stability and love in a way she struggles with some of the men.\" Ms. Nottage added that Nola is \"a woman who is polyamorous with fluid sexuality\" and is incredibly attracted to Opal as a lover as well. The show does not only expand Nola’s sexual universe, it also pays attention to the ways in which her and other black female characters’ bodies are constantly under surveillance (by white shopkeepers), exploited (at a local burlesque club or on reality TV), threatened (by police officers) and even assaulted (by everyday men on the street). \"The original film ends with this very violent attack against Nola, which wasn’t adequately addressed,\" Ms. Nottage said, referring to the highly criticized scene in which Jaime rapes Nola. \"I think now we have the tools to have that conversation, particularly in the African-American community, in a really open way.\" Though Mr. Lee has expressed regret about that scene, he said addressing those criticisms was not his motivation in engaging the topic more forthrightly in the TV series. \"People forget, I’ve been in the game for 30 years,\" Mr. Lee said, modifying the number of years with an expletive. \"That stuff just slides down my back, and I keep doing what I’m doing, keep trying to perfect my craft.\" (This comment came immediately after he listed a range of critics of his early work, including Ms. Hooks and David Denby and Joe Klein’s prophesies in New York magazine that \"Do the Right Thing\" would cause uproar or a race riot.) The rape scene does not appear in the TV version of \"She’s Gotta Have It.\" Instead, in the first episode, Nola is assaulted on the street by a stranger, serving as a catalyst for her to find her voice as an artist and activist. As an oil painter of African-American portraits and a guerrilla-style artist who anonymously begins an anti-street harassment campaign, Nola represents Mr. Lee’s native Brooklyn, the frequent setting and subject of most of his films, at a crossroads. Tatyana Fazlalizadeh is the creator of the \"Stop Telling Me to Smile\" public art campaign, which was the inspiration for Nola’s art in the series. \"I moved to Brooklyn five years ago, and when I got here, I immediately started doing my project,\" she said. \"So for me, being a woman, being an artist, being harassed on the street, experiencing the public space as a woman is my experience here.\" While \"She’s Gotta Have It\" seems attuned to the complexities of these women’s stories, the show also grapples — in a more sustained way than in the movie — with the tensions and traumas of gentrification. In this way, Nola is a far more radical artist and, for that matter, character than her contemporary Brooklynites on \"Girls,\" \"Search Party\" and even the racially diverse \"Master of None.\" For her, struggle as an artist is heightened by rising rents; cultural disagreements with her new, affluent white neighbors; and the displacement of black residents who, like her, have lived in Brooklyn their entire lives. \"With gentrification, no one talks about people who get moved out — that’s never the conversation,\" Mr. Lee said. \"God bless, if we get two more seasons, we can explore these things, the good and the bad, about the Republic of Brooklyn.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/arts/television/spike-lee-shes-gotta-have-it-netflix.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Why Richard Avedon’s Work Has Never Been More Relevant', 'text': ' In 1964, Richard Avedon published \"Nothing Personal,\" a lavish coffee table book with gravure-printed portraits of individuals who do not fit into any single classification: Allen Ginsberg standing naked in a Buddhist pose opposite George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party; the puffy-eyed Dorothy Parker, her bags containing a lifetime of tears, side by side with a sullen and deflated, if still-shimmering, Marilyn Monroe; a young and earnest Julian Bond among members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee; and the grizzled William Casby, who had been born into slavery about 100 years earlier. \"Nothing Personal\" was published only months after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, in the period of profound cultural soul-searching following President Kennedy’s assassination. Despite Avedon’s glamorous reputation, it was his social conscience — revealed in the range of photographs in this book — that may be the surprise that deepens his enduring legacy. On Nov. 17, the first comprehensive presentation of material from \"Nothing Personal\" will be on view at Pace/MacGill Gallery in Chelsea, through Jan. 13; concurrently, Taschen is releasing a new edition of the book, with the original essay by James Baldwin — and a new one by Hilton Als. \"It isn’t like a simple Disney melody,\" Peter MacGill, the president of Pace/MacGill, said in a telephone interview about ‘‘Nothing Personal.’’ \"Avedon and Baldwin cared deeply about America.\" Mr. MacGill believes Avedon’s work has never been more relevant because \"the ’60s were an explosive time, and we are in an explosive time today.\" Avedon collaborated with Baldwin, his old high school friend, who wrote a cri de coeur of astonishing eloquence about the absence of common dignity in America, denouncing the false myths and damaging racial and ethnic hierarchies, and, ultimately, abjectly, pointing to the deep and abiding loneliness that underlies the glossy veneer of American optimism put forward by Hollywood and the media. Baldwin’s essay begins with a withering description of the television ads he is forced to endure while watching the news — ads that aim to sanitize, brighten, straighten, tame and tweak the skin, hair, teeth and bodies of viewers into an impossible standard of perfection that positions the enemy to be, well, nature itself. The portraits in \"Nothing Personal\" present a stark yet authentic counterpoint to the American image of eternal youth and anodyne good cheer. The book’s most resonant chords hover at a frequency detected in the balance of Avedon’s austere minimalism and Baldwin’s mournful jeremiad. Only one portrait in \"Nothing Personal\" bears a date: \"Maj. Claude Eatherly, Pilot at Hiroshima, August 6, 1945.\" It refers not to when the photograph was made but to when Major Eatherly flew weather reconnaissance over Hiroshima and then gave the O.K. to drop the first atomic bomb, code-named \"Little Boy.\" Avedon first contacted Eatherly to photograph him in early 1963. \"For a long, long time I have felt a connection with you, as have my wife and many of my friends,\" Avedon wrote to him in Galveston, Tex., \"because what happened to you is almost like a metaphor of what many Americans feel has happened to them.\" Avedon flew to Galveston to make his tightly cropped portrait of Eatherly, brow furrowed and hand cupped over his eye as if to scrutinize the distant horizon. In a series of museum talks, Colin Westerbeck, the eminent photography historian, argued that Major Eatherly is the central portrait in \"Nothing Personal,\" perhaps even in Avedon’s entire career. He pointed out the absence of shadow and the blown-out background in Avedon’s portraiture that left \"every wrinkle, stubble, wen and nervous tick\" on his subjects faces strikingly visible. \"When that bank of strobes went off in Avedon’s studio — pfoom! — subjects must have felt as if they’d been caught in an atomic bomb blast,\" Mr. Westerbeck said. That \"bomb blast\" became the signature style with which Avedon went on to create many series of photographs, including \"The Family,\" 69 portraits of the most powerful and influential Americans in 1976, published in Rolling Stone for the country’s bicentennial. His 1985 book, \"In the American West,\" consists of portraits of anonymous workers, drifters, cowboys and random citizens made throughout the Western United States over five years, a contrast to the pantheon of accomplishment and celebrity that characterized most of Avedon’s portraiture. In conceiving \"Nothing Personal,\" Avedon might have had in mind a dialogue with \"The Americans,\" by Robert Frank, published five years earlier — an artist’s book that struck a sober note about the story America told itself versus the realities of daily life for its citizens. At the time, \"The Americans\" was little known outside of New York art circles, but the book had a profound influence on photographers — including Avedon — and on the direction of photography itself. While Mr. Frank had traveled across the country to capture happened-upon moments in ordinary life, Avedon’s idiom was the portrait, with which he was equally intent on telling a deeper truth about America. Implicit in Avedon’s version was the persistent threat to our existence, something the Cuban missile crisis had brought that much closer two years before \"Nothing Personal\" was published. At the time, Avedon considered the portraits in the book to be \"some of my very best work.\" Yet, to his surprise and chagrin, the public reaction was swift and hostile. Writing in The New York Review of Books, Robert Brustein lashed out at the book’s extravagant \"snow-white covers with sterling silver titles\" before excoriating the effort in his critique. (It predated by six years Tom Wolfe’s incendiary 1970 essay, \"Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny’s,\" in New York magazine — a savage takedown of New York’s intellectual circle of \"limousine liberals\" as conspicuous hypocrites.) \"‘Nothing Personal’ pretends to be a ruthless indictment of contemporary America,\" Brustein wrote, \"but the people likely to buy this extravagant volume are the subscribers to fashion magazines, while the moralistic authors of the work are themselves pretty fashionable, affluent, and chic.\" Truman Capote came to Avedon’s defense in a letter to the editors published the following month: \"Would he rather it was printed on paper-toweling?\" Capote asked. \"Brustein accuses Avedon of distorting reality. But can one say what is reality in art? — ‘An artist,’ to repeat Picasso, ‘paints not what he sees, but what he thinks about what he sees.’ This applies to photography — provided the photographer is an artist, and Avedon is.\" The year before \"Nothing Personal\" was published, Avedon had traveled to the South to photograph leaders of the civil rights movement, among them Martin Luther King Jr., as well as those who staunchly opposed it, such as Gov. George Wallace, of Alabama. When he returned to New York, he opened his studio to photographers from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (S.N.C.C.) to train them to shoot rallies and sit-ins in a photojournalistic style that the mainstream press would publish. He convinced Marty Forscher, the owner of Professional Camera Repair Service, to donate 75 cameras and a supply of film to the S.N.C.C. for three years. In 1965, Visual Arts Gallery, where Avedon was a board member, mounted a show of S.N.C.C. photographers’ work. At DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, Avedon, who was Jewish, and Baldwin, who was African-American, were editors of \"The Magpie,\" the school’s literary magazine. They conceived a project with text and photographs called \"Harlem Doorways\" that never fully got off the ground. In later years, Avedon recounted the time as students when Baldwin came to visit him at home on East 86th Street, and the doorman made him use the service elevator. Avedon’s mother was furious and summoned the doorman upstairs to apologize to young Baldwin for the insult. Can Avedon’s illustrious image coexist with evidence of his social conscience? It is found throughout his work and in the causes he championed, both publicly and privately. In 1955, he photographed Marian Anderson, who was performing in Verdi’s \"Un Ballo in Maschera,\" the first African-American soloist to sing on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera. In the portrait, her mouth is rounded into an oval so expressive that you can almost hear her voice — an unusual feat of visual onomatopoeia. The portrait ran in Harper’s Bazaar and Avedon considered its publication his own small stand against racial discrimination. In 1959, when Avedon first photographed China Machado, a Chinese-born, Portuguese-American fashion model — encouraged by Diana Vreeland, the fashion editor of Bazaar — the magazine’s publisher said: \"Listen, we can’t publish these pictures. The girl is not white.\" Avedon was so angry that he threatened to leave Bazaar. The pictures were published. As the guest editor of the April 1965 issue of Bazaar, Avedon included his own pictures of Donyale Luna, the first African-American model to appear in the magazine, and endured the wrath of William Randolph Hearst Jr., the publisher, when advertisers pulled out of the magazine. \"For reasons of racial prejudice and the economics of the fashion business,\" Avedon said, he never photographed her for editorial use again. In 1967, hired by McCann Erikson, the advertising agency, to work on a Coca-Cola campaign, he chose an African-American high school teacher as its focus. While only tiny dents in racism’s hardy shell, for Avedon, a first-generation immigrant who endured anti-Semitism throughout his childhood in New York City, each editorial milestone felt like a groundbreaking moral victory. Avedon had numerous museum exhibitions during his lifetime, yet the art world was slow to accept him. Because he had become the world’s foremost fashion photographer early in his career, his name carried the taint of commerce and critics too often dismissed these portraits as \"stylized.\" Stylization was never what he was after. Instead, he gave all his subjects equal stature, shooting each one with strobe lighting against a white background — specimens of the species that could annihilate itself at any moment. Avedon instinctively understood the threat to our existence posed by \"Little Boy\" at Hiroshima; his stone-cold, corpselike representation of individuals in the second half of the 20th century remains the existential register of his portraiture. \"Strangely,\" he wrote in his letter to Eatherly, \"just as your experience, although in a way too horrible to be borne, made you see that we are all part of one another, the fact of you does the same for us.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/arts/design/richard-avedon-nothing-personal-pace-macgill.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Björk’s New Album Is a Love Letter to Optimism', 'text': ' What comes after heartbreak? For Björk, it’s \"a love letter to enthusiasm and optimism,\" she said. Björk’s darkly formidable 2015 album, \"Vulnicura,\" reflected the breakup of her decade-long relationship with the artist Matthew Barney in songs of nearly paralyzing pain and simmering anger, weighted with dissonant, dramatic strings. But her new album, \"Utopia,\" prizes airiness: the breath that powers voices and flutes; the atmosphere where birds fly; structures and tempos that change freely rather than being locked to a beat. The album, due on Nov. 24, is the latest iteration of Björk’s career-long fascination with how nature and technology can interact. In an interview at her apartment in Brooklyn, she said \"Utopia\" had long been her working title for the album. While making it, she read extensively about utopias: in academic studies and in stories and novels through the centuries, from ancient fables to the science fiction of Octavia E. Butler. \"Utopia has gone from everything being monasteries, to feminist islands, to socialism, to ‘Peach Blossom Spring,’\" she said, referring to a tale of an isolated, idyllic community that was written in the fifth century in China. The 2016 election of Donald J. Trump only strengthened her determination to envision hope. \"If optimism ever was like an emergency, it’s now,\" she said. \"Instead of moaning and becoming really angry, we need to actually come up with suggestions of what the world we want to live in, in the future, could be. This album is supposed to be like an idea, a suggestion, a proposal of the world we could live in.\" Björk’s proposal involves \"that feeling, post-Trump, when everything’s gone horribly wrong,\" she said. \"And you escape to an island, and there’s a lot of women there with children, and everybody’s playing flutes, and everybody’s naked, and there’s all these plants you’ve never seen before and all these birds you’ve never heard before, and orchids, and it has that feeling of pioneering into a new world.\" Björk, 51, played a nearly finished version of the album for me during one of her brief stays in New York City this year, on a muggy day back in July. (She has since been to London, to her home in Iceland, and on tour to Moscow, Buenos Aires and Tbilisi, juggling concerts with her band, gigs as a disc jockey and curating Björk Digital, a traveling exhibition of her virtual-reality videos, which she will expand with songs from \"Utopia.\") That afternoon, she was outfitted in a multicolored dress with an asymmetrical cut. After playing through the album on her stereo, she conversed volubly about the music across her kitchen table, over cups of strong coffee. \"I started thinking about this album as a city in the clouds,\" she said. \"It doesn’t have gravity. It’s more like floating in the air.\" The album concludes with \"Future Forever,\" with shimmering chords and Björk’s voice floating above silences; she invokes a benign matriarchy. \"Imagine a future and be in it/feel this incredible nurture, soak it in,\" she sings, then turns to tech advice. \"Your past is a loop — turn it off.\" But Björk has been ruminating on the past in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein and others, and has decided to reckon with it. In a recent telephone call, she addressed an episode from her life that she had decided to air. In October, she posted on Facebook that she had faced unwanted touches and sexual advances from a \"Danish director\": clearly Lars von Trier, who directed her in the 2000 film \"Dancer in the Dark.\" \"I don’t want to be self-important in this,\" Björk said on the phone from Iceland. \"There are women out there that got it way worse than me.\" But when reading about Mr. Weinstein, she said, she was struck by \"how he used the media against the ladies.\" Stories had circulated at the time of filming that Björk was \"difficult\" on the set. But she said: \"I was very conscientious. I showed up for every shoot on time,\" until there was a dispute over control of her music. \"When I talked about this project with Lars, he always promised me I had full control of my music,\" she said. \"But I was turning up at dance rehearsals, and somebody else had been editing my music in a way that was totally musically wrong. And they would keep telling me, ‘Oh, it belongs to us now, it’s not yours.’ \"After two months of just turning up for every single thing, and really just accepting all the harassment and just becoming part of the whole — just keeping on doing what I was told, basically — I had one weekend where I stood up. I could stand up as a musician and say, ‘I’m not returning back to work on Monday unless I get full control of my music.’ And that took one day. On Monday night, they said yes, and then on Tuesday, I returned to work.\" After Björk’s Facebook posts, Mr. von Trier’s assistant told Rolling Stone, \"Lars declines the accusations Björk has made, but doesn’t wish to comment any further.\" The Guardian reported that Mr. von Trier had told a Danish newspaper that he had not sexually harassed her. \"That was not the case,\" he told the newspaper, Jyllands-Posten. \"But that we were definitely not friends, that’s a fact.\" Attempts to reach Mr. von Trier for comment for this article received no response. Björk described a far happier working environment during the making of \"Utopia.\" Like \"Vulnicura,\" the new album barely resembles music for pop radio playlists or dance clubs. It’s often dense and disorienting, with contending layers of vocals, flutes and percussive sounds. The songs are akin to chamber music and to the electronic experimentation of Björk’s collaborator throughout the album, the electronic musician Arca (Alejandro Ghersi), who grew up on Björk’s music. \"He knew my back catalog better than I did,\" she said. Arca, who has also worked on tracks for Kanye West and the R&B singer Kelela, joined Björk partway through the making of \"Vulnicura,\" and went on to tour with her amid his own prolific solo efforts. While Björk’s many previous co-producers have been enlisted to help execute her ideas, \"Utopia\" is closer to a full partnership. \"What was different was that me and Alejandro were merging,\" Björk said. \"We felt like we could write 50 albums, because it was so fun. At first we were really surprised because the generational gap is pretty large between us, and then we figured out that philosophically, we share a lot of things. And there’s an optimistic and a celebrational element in both of our music that we really like.\" Arca gently steered her toward his favorite lesser-known Björk tracks, both instrumentals: \"Ambergris March,\" from her score for \"Drawing Restraint 9,\" and \"Batabid,\" a B side from 2001. There are echoes of them in her new songs. \"He was mirroring back to me a side of me that I probably would have ignored,\" Björk said. Meanwhile, for the bird calls she wanted, Björk chose species recorded in Arca’s home country, Venezuela. \"We were sending each other a thousand ideas — it was like playing games with someone,\" Björk said. \"It’s so interesting to communicate on so many levels. I was telling him, when I was being a music nerd at the beginning of this album: ‘If we are going to merge as two musicians, let’s go out of the grid. Let’s try to not do the normal song structure thing, but meet in a very instrumental way. Let’s have freedom.’\" Björk has often based an album on a particular sonic palette: strings for \"Vulnicura,\" the human voice for \"Medulla,\" the angelic, staccato sounds of harps, celesta and music boxes for \"Vespertine.\" For \"Utopia,\" Björk turned to the flute, the instrument she played growing up. \"My flute side has been dormant for a long time,\" she said. To record the music she had composed on her computer, Björk gathered an ensemble of a dozen flutists, all women, for \"Flute Fridays\" in Reykjavik. \"I tried to get as many colors out of the flutes as possible,\" she said. \"I miked them differently. Sometimes I had 12 flutes, sometimes six. There was alto flute, bass flute, tenor flute. They’re treated a lot, with a lot of effects, or they’re really clean, with nothing on them. \"We went between the churches in Reykjavik, trying to get the right sound,\" she added. \"Plus, I recorded a lot of the flutes in my cabin by the lake — trying to create this world where you have people hanging out in your living room, playing flutes and singing and making beats, but it’s part of real life.\" The hinge between \"Vulnicura\" and \"Utopia\" is \"The Gate,\" which Björk has released as the new album’s first single and as a kaleidoscopic video clip, awash in computer graphics yet somehow pastoral as well. She sings about the healing of the chest wound she showed on the cover of \"Vulnicura,\" and its turning into a gateway for love, as the song rises to a fervent refrain: \"I care for you, care for you.\" Another \"manifesto,\" Björk said, is \"Body Memory\"; in its verses she overthinks herself into predicaments, only to be saved, in the choruses, by her instincts. Her new songs also take up the more immediate pleasures of music and burgeoning romance. In \"Blissing Me,\" she sings about \"two music nerds obsessing,\" falling in love by \"sending each other MP3s.\" In \"Courtship,\" she looks into software-assisted dating. \"He turned me down/I then downturned another/who then downturned her,\" she sings, over chords built from flutes, and bursts of sputtering percussion hinting distantly at techno. There’s still some lingering resentment and sorrow in songs like the defiant \"Sue Me\" and \"Tabula Rasa,\" and broader thoughts of solace in \"Loss,\" an elegiac melody strafed by a frenetic beat. But Björk wanted the album to look ahead. \"‘Vulnicura’ was the end of a chapter, and this is the beginning of a new chapter,\" she said. \"You go through different periods in your life. It would be really nice if we could just figure out one recipe that would work throughout our whole lives. But fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, most things don’t last long, and you have to rethink things, whether it’s practical or emotional or spiritual or whatever level it has to be. \"In the beginning of each period, you have to dream. You have to say, ‘Oh, I want …,’ and it might at the beginning sound very utopian. But then if half of it becomes real, that’s pretty good going. But you have to come up with, OK, what do I want to do next?\" As the summer interview wound down, the afternoon suddenly darkened; there was a rumble of thunder, and a heavy downpour began. Björk smiled to hear it. \"All the tension has broken,\" she said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/arts/music/bjork-utopia-interview.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'What’s on TV Sunday: ‘Search Party’ and the American Music Awards', 'text': ' \"Search Party,\" starring Alia Shawkat, returns for a second season.

Would the U.S. Let Him Go?', 'text': ' TORONTO — Forty inmates lined up for the daily mail call at the Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution, a complex of low-slung brick buildings in the middle of New Jersey. It was July 2012, and one of the inmates was Philip Baker. A former hedge fund manager, he was serving a 20-year sentence for fraud. He had used bogus performance data to lure hundreds of people and institutions into his fund. His investors had lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Baker, 46 at the time, admitted that he had committed fraud. \"I’m a criminal,\" he said recently. But he had convinced himself that he deserved to be free. And he was waiting for a letter that might turn his fantasy into reality. Months earlier, Mr. Baker, who is Canadian, had signed a plea agreement that included an unusual caveat: Prosecutors would not object to the Justice Department’s transferring him to Canada to serve out his sentence. Such transfers were rare. But Mr. Baker knew that if he could persuade the Justice Department to give him one, Canada would probably parole him after he had served only a fraction of his prison term. Mr. Baker, a Baptist, prayed for God’s guidance. \"Only he could set my direction straight,\" he said during one in a series of interviews about his life and crimes. In the prison’s television room, a guard dispensing the mail called out inmates’ names and numbers. \"Philip Baker, 22856-424.\" Mr. Baker stepped forward. The guard handed him a thin envelope with a Justice Department return address. Assuming it was more paperwork, he tore it open — and could not believe what he saw. He started to tremble. He felt people staring at him. \"I felt like throwing up,\" he said. After the financial crisis last decade, the federal government was expected to aggressively pursue criminal cases against top financiers: the fund managers, bankers, mortgage lenders and Wall Street executives who helped cause the global economy to crater. But prosecutions have been rare. The exceptions have been obscure or relatively junior industry players against whom it was easy to build cases but who did not bear primary responsibility for the crisis. One reason: Prosecutors were under pressure to move quickly and to not lose trials. They preferred to take the safest, simplest routes to win convictions, and to then move on to new cases. That is what happened with Mr. Baker, who became a top target. The government labeled him a fugitive, made him the subject of an international manhunt and, eventually, extradited him from Germany, where he had been living with his wife. Mr. Baker was not a big fish; his hedge fund had under $1 billion in assets. And even when he was apprehended, a desire to resolve the case swiftly led a powerful United States attorney to insert the transfer-to-Canada clause into an otherwise airtight plea agreement. His experience highlights one of the primary critiques of the Obama administration’s efforts to clean up Wall Street: Bankers nearly destroyed the global economy, but few went to jail. This account of Mr. Baker’s long-shot effort to escape to Canada, which has not previously been reported, is based on interviews with him and his family, and with his lawyers, former colleagues and current and former government officials, as well as on thousands of pages of legal documents, internal emails and other records from Mr. Baker’s defunct hedge fund. Philip Baker was raised in a middle-class family in Toronto. One of his earliest memories took place in the hospital. Born with a heart defect, he needed surgery when he was 7. When it was time for the procedure, his parents walked out of his hospital room. \"I thought they were abandoning me,\" he said. That fear stayed with him, fostering a desire to please his parents and other authority figures. As a boy, he showed an affinity for finance. While his friends played with toy soldiers, he toted a leather briefcase and pretended to be a stockbroker. But his early years in the financial industry were rocky. After dropping out of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., he eventually landed at the brokerage Refco. Colleagues remember an insecure man whose nickname was \"Philipbuster,\" because of his tendency to talk endlessly. He married a woman from a wealthy Canadian family, heirs to the Hollinger media fortune. The couple had five children in Windsor, Ontario. \"I was always trying to impress that family,\" Mr. Baker said. Hoping to prove that he could succeed as an entrepreneur, he quit Refco to start his own hedge fund. The fund failed. Mr. Baker lied to his wife and in-laws that he had found a new job at a big Detroit bank. For several months, he put on a suit and pretended to cross the Detroit River and go to work. One day, he said, his wife tried to call him at the office. The bank told her that nobody named Philip Baker worked there. Mr. Baker recalls her words to him that evening, when he came home: \"Get out.\" The marriage was over. (She declined to be interviewed.) He holed up in a friend’s basement. One morning, he grabbed a .22-caliber rifle and drove to a forest outside town. He called a former Refco colleague, John Kurgan, and said he was preparing to kill himself. \"Slow down a minute, cowboy,\" Mr. Kurgan responded. He told Mr. Baker he had a job prospect for him in Toronto. Then, noting that Mr. Baker had called in on a recorded Refco line, Mr. Kurgan jokingly asked if he could sell the audio of his suicide. Mr. Baker was infuriated by the comment. But it snapped him out of his suicidal stupor. What happened next set the stage for Mr. Baker’s later downfall. According to Mr. Baker and to his plea agreement, he and Mr. Kurgan went into business together. They formed a new commodities-trading hedge fund, Lake Shore Asset Management. Mr. Baker lined up clients, and Mr. Kurgan did much of the trading. Mr. Kurgan was not charged with wrongdoing. In an interview, he declined to describe his role in the business. \"This is something that happened many years ago,\" he said. Mr. Baker set up shop in another basement — this one in his parents’ home, north of Toronto. He raised more than $10 million for the fund. A tiny sum in hedge-fund terms, but enough that Lake Shore was able to start trading in February 2002. The fund got off to a spectacularly bad start. That summer, a single futures trade lost 48 percent of the fund’s assets. Mr. Baker blamed Mr. Kurgan for the bad trade. To hide the loss, Lake Shore concocted data that showed a stellar performance. Mr. Baker shared the bogus numbers with current and prospective clients. One marketing brochure cited annual returns of more than 30 percent. Another claimed falsely that the firm had a 14-year investing record. Mr. Kurgan, now working at Royal Bank of Canada, accused Mr. Baker of \"trying to muddy my name\" and noted that \"the justice system obviously found him guilty.\" Mr. Kurgan did not respond to detailed follow-up questions sent to him by email. Mr. Baker knew he was committing fraud. \"I failed to stand up for my clients,\" he said, adding that he did not want to betray Mr. Kurgan, whom he credited with preventing his suicide. \"I became too loyal.\" The firm attracted hundreds of new clients. Royal Bank of Canada invested millions of dollars, as did EquiGenesis, a Toronto money manager specializing in tax-efficient investing and charitable giving. Lake Shore \"created an impression of credibility,\" said Kenneth M. Gordon, EquiGenesis’s president. Lake Shore’s staff grew to more than a dozen traders and salespeople. It opened offices in London and Geneva. Prominent finance executives, including Laurence Rosenberg, the former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, joined the board. Mr. Baker bought bespoke suits. He hired a butler. At a club in Hamburg, Germany, one night, he met Kristina Malychenko, a tall blonde from Kazakhstan. They started dating. Mr. Baker was earning millions — more than $7 million in the first half of 2007 alone, he said. He felt like he was proving himself. \"I chased pride and vanity,\" he said. He described himself as being \"on the cusp of happiness.\" Lake Shore wanted to enter the American market. It set up a website aimed at investors in United States. That turned out to be a crucial mistake. A self-regulatory organization, the National Futures Association, started scrutinizing Lake Shore. The group alerted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to what appeared to be suspicious claims on the website. The commission concluded that Lake Shore had been soliciting American clients without legal authorization. Mr. Kurgan began to distance himself from the fund. He emailed Mr. Baker: \"If, through your kindness, you have listed me as either, director, partner or any other title with any of the Lake Shore entities please remove my name at once.\" As investigators dug in, they realized the fund had been lying about its history and performance. The problems deepened in August 2007, when the cash-management firm holding Lake Shore’s assets filed for bankruptcy. What little money the firm’s clients had left was now stuck in an insolvent firm. \"I felt like Napoleon being attacked by all sides,\" Mr. Baker said. Lake Shore shipped many of its files and computer hard drives to Geneva. Mr. Baker’s lawyer refused to hand over the materials to the Americans, citing Swiss bank-secrecy laws. \"We invested money in good faith based on representations they made, and then the money vanished,\" Mr. Gordon of EquiGenesis said. \"It was a disaster.\" The commodities trading commission filed civil fraud charges against Mr. Baker and Lake Shore. A federal judge, persuaded that Mr. Baker was on the run and hiding evidence, referred the case to the local United States attorney’s office for criminal investigation. F.B.I. agents interviewed Mr. Baker’s Lake Shore colleagues. Mr. Kurgan told them that he had no formal role with Lake Shore and was only its outside broker, an F.B.I. summary of the interview shows. By the F.B.I.’s tally, Lake Shore’s roughly 700 clients had lost more than $300 million. Investigators believed that Mr. Baker and others at the firm had siphoned off at least $11 million for their personal use. In February 2009, a grand jury returned a sealed, 27-count indictment accusing Mr. Baker of fraud, embezzlement and obstruction of justice. His colleagues were not charged. That month, Mr. Baker married Ms. Malychenko in a civil ceremony in Hamburg, where the two were living. He said he did not know that he had been indicted, or even that he was a wanted man. With Lake Shore dead, he said, he was trying to focus on the future. \"God had a different plan, and I moved on,\" he said. Investigators, though, were moving in. A few months later, in June 2009, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the United States attorney in Chicago, unsealed the criminal charges and described Mr. Baker as a \"fugitive.\" The Justice Department issued an international arrest warrant via Interpol. Within a few weeks — and just days after Mr. Baker and Ms. Malychenko celebrated their nuptials with a black-tie party at a Hamburg yacht club — a pair of plainclothes German police officers appeared at Mr. Baker’s door. They escorted him to their car. His new wife blew him a kiss. Mr. Baker was held in a prison near the Hamburg airport. One day, an official from the Canadian Embassy came to visit with a brochure explaining Mr. Baker’s rights as a Canadian citizen. One right he learned about: If he were convicted in the United States, he would be entitled under an international treaty to apply to be transferred to Canada to serve his sentence. \"That’s when I started thinking about how to pull this off,\" he said. In December 2009, after Mr. Baker had spent five months in a German jail, United States marshals flew him to Chicago, where he was booked into the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Months passed as he awaited a trial date, and Mr. Baker learned the prison’s rhythms. The most important thing, he said, was to convince other inmates that he was not a child molester. He told them he was a Wall Street crook. Prosecutors thought they had a clear-cut case against him. But in April 2010, the court-appointed receiver overseeing Lake Shore’s bankruptcy issued a report that said Mr. Kurgan was a part owner of Lake Shore and its affiliates and had played an official role at the companies. That clouded the prosecution narrative that Mr. Baker had acted on his own. Clifford C. Histed, the lead prosecutor on the case, summoned Mr. Baker to discuss the report. Mr. Baker argued that it proved he did not deserve to be punished alone. And he said the commodities trading commission was making Lake Shore a scapegoat, flexing its enforcement muscles after failing to prevent other hedge funds from blowing up. Mr. Histed told him to provide proof. Mr. Baker, using a computer in the prison library, spent months sifting through electronic documents before presenting his case to Mr. Histed. The prosecutor did not agree that Mr. Baker was the victim of a government conspiracy. But in Mr. Baker’s final plea agreement, prosecutors said Mr. Baker did have a partner, described as \"Individual A,\" who had misrepresented Lake Shore’s returns and misappropriated money. \"Individual A\" refers to Mr. Kurgan, according to a person involved in the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plea document. Mr. Baker and his lawyer, Daniel L. Rashbaum, a former prosecutor, were running out of legal options. Then Mr. Baker remembered the Canadian treaty he had learned about in Germany. Starting in the late 1970s, the United States had entered into a series of treaties that established protocols for cross-border prisoner transfers. One catalyst was the nonfiction book \"Midnight Express,\" the basis of a 1978 movie, about a young American imprisoned in Turkey. From 2005 to 2010, the Justice Department rejected 97 percent of all transfer applications, according to a 2011 government report. One reason was that federal prosecutors often opposed transfers on the grounds that prisoners did not serve their full sentences if transferred. That gave Mr. Rashbaum an idea. If he could get the United States attorney’s office to support a transfer to Canada, perhaps Justice Department officials in Washington would go along with it. And the Canadians, Mr. Rashbaum recalled thinking, were likely to let Mr. Baker out quickly. In that case, the length of his sentence in America wouldn’t matter. Mr. Rashbaum approached Mr. Histed with a proposal: Mr. Baker would admit guilt and accept a 20-year prison sentence, with no chance for parole, if the prosecutors did not object to him being transferred to Canada. Mr. Histed said in an interview that he knew the defense hoped the maneuver would result in Mr. Baker’s freedom, but he doubted it would work. And more important, he knew that going to trial would be time-consuming and risky for the government, in part because Mr. Baker could raise questions in front of a jury about why he alone was on trial. So Mr. Histed agreed to the deal. \"What mattered to us was that he be brought to justice in the United States,\" he said in an interview. On Aug. 24, 2011, Mr. Baker was presented a plea agreement to sign. He was nervous; his lawyer was terrified. \"The horror of pleading someone to 20 years based on a creative plan scared the living daylights out of me,\" Mr. Rashbaum said. Mr. Baker took a deep breath and signed the document. Mr. Rashbaum walked out to the parking lot and vomited. The government’s news release announcing Mr. Baker’s plea and sentence did not mention the possibility of a transfer to Canada. Neither did newspaper accounts. Before Mr. Baker left Chicago to begin serving his sentence, he received a bill from the Justice Department for $154,831,682.32 in restitution. \"We strongly urge you to pay this debt immediately,\" the bill said. He also received divorce papers from his wife. Mr. Baker filed his transfer application in April 2012. He knew it was a gamble. He had not paid any of his restitution, and Justice Department guidelines listed unpaid fines as a reason for rejecting such applications. On the other hand, the department had recently been criticized for being stingy in approving international transfers. Three months later, Mr. Baker stood in the mail-call line and opened the letter that would change his life. \"The United States has approved the request for transfer to Canada of the above-named Canadian national,\" it read. Mr. Baker felt dizzy. He scanned the letter again to make sure he had not misread it. Then he walked back to his cell. \"I think God really stepped in,\" he said. He had been imprisoned for about three years — five months in Germany, two years in Chicago and seven months at Fort Dix — after being convicted of a single count of fraud. As a result, he would probably be eligible for parole in Canada. Mr. Histed, the prosecutor, said the speed of the decision surprised him. \"If we knew he would immediately have been approved for a transfer, would that have changed our stance?\" he said. \"Perhaps.\" Mr. Baker’s transfer to Canada still needed the approval of the authorities there. Vic Toews, the minister for public safety at that time, believed that such transfers posed public-safety risks. He wrote that, because he had lived in Germany, Mr. Baker intended \"to abandon Canada as his place of permanent residence.\" The application was rejected. \"I always thought the hitch would be with the U.S. government, not the Canadians,\" Mr. Baker said. He had convinced himself that freedom was imminent. Now he was marooned in New Jersey. Coming to terms with the prospect of spending years in prison, he started to teach yoga. He dispensed investing advice to guards. He got a landscaping job on the prison grounds. His monthly pay was $18, a few dollars of which were earmarked to pay down his $155 million debt. And he began writing about his experience. Not knowing how his tale would end, he finished with a fictional scene in which he was reunited with his father on the shore of a lake where he had sailed as a boy. Then, after Mr. Baker had spent nearly six years incarcerated in America, Canada elected a new government, and Mr. Baker sensed an opportunity. Perhaps the new administration would have a more positive attitude about prisoner transfers. He reapplied. And this time, it worked. On May 10, 2016, another letter arrived, this one from Ottawa. Canada’s public safety minister, it said, \"has approved your transfer to Canada.\" Last fall, Mr. Baker rode a bus across the Canadian border to a minimum-security prison. He could cook for himself, and go fishing. Two months later, his case manager called him to ask: \"Do you want to go home?\" It was his mother’s birthday. The prison gave him a winter jacket and a bus ticket to Toronto. On the bus, Mr. Baker borrowed a passenger’s cellphone and called his father. \"I’m on a bus!\" he exclaimed. \"I started to cry,\" his father, William Baker, recalled. The elder Mr. Baker told his wife that he was taking her to dinner. The place, he said, was a surprise. Instead, he drove to a shopping mall northeast of Toronto. Their son was standing outside an Old Navy store. Mr. Baker’s release was not announced. His former colleagues, his first wife, the Lake Shore clients who lost money — no one knew he was out. \"I’m sorry he’s out of jail, because that’s where he belongs,\" said Mr. Rosenberg, the former Lake Shore director. \"He screwed so many people.\" Mr. Baker moved back into his parents’ basement. He set up a small office with some accouterments — a golden pen case, a picture of a yacht — from his Lake Shore days. He interviewed for a job as a financial consultant. He contemplated turning his prison writings into a book. That was when he discovered he had miscalculated. In prison, he had imagined that if he got to Canada, the authorities in the United States would not pursue him for the $155 million he owed. But this summer, a lawyer whom he had consulted about a book deal broke the news: The receiver in the Lake Shore bankruptcy could chase him and any money he made, through Canada’s civil courts. So Mr. Baker is free. But he has no prospect of escaping the shadow of his former life. \"I’m screwed,\" he said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/business/a-hedge-fund-manager-committed-fraud-would-the-us-let-him-go.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'In China, an Education in Dating', 'text': ' JINAN, China — Zhang Zhenxiao is 27 years old. He has never been in a relationship. He has never kissed a woman. Now, Mr. Zhang is ready for love — but like many men in China, he doesn’t know where to begin. So Mr. Zhang turned to a dating coach. The \"Fall in Love Emotional Education\" school, which caters to straight men, has taught him how to groom himself, approach a woman and flirt his way into her smartphone contacts. \"There are many people who lack the ability to have a relationship,\" said Mr. Zhang, who enrolled in a three-day course during a weeklong holiday in October. \"Many times, it’s not that there’s something wrong with us. It’s that we don’t know what details to pay attention to.\" While dating is hard everywhere, it is arguably worse for Chinese men looking for a woman. China’s now-ended one-child policy, carried out in a country with a strong cultural preference for boys, prompted many couples to abort female fetuses. In 2016, there were about 33.6 million more men than women in China, according to the government. \"They are caught in a very difficult situation, especially for those with no money,\" said Li Yinhe, a prominent scholar of sexuality in China. China worries about its lonely hearts. Newspapers warn that a surplus of unhappy, single men in China could lead to an increase in human trafficking, sex crimes and social instability. So the government is playing matchmaker. In June, the Communist Youth League, a training ground for many top officials, organized a mass speed dating event for 2,000 young singles in the eastern province of Zhejiang. The same month, the All-China Women’s Federation in northwestern Gansu Province helped organize a similar event for \"leftover men and women,\" a term used in China to refer to unmarried people in their late 20s or older. For decades, Chinese marriages were arranged through matchmakers or families. In some places, parents still post the résumés of their single children on trees and lampposts. Marriage was utilitarian, done so people could start a family. Even when the notion of \"freedom to love\" became popular after 1950, there were few social venues for people to snuggle and mingle. Until the late 1990s, sex outside marriage was illegal. Mr. Zhang’s dating coach, Zhang Mindong, said he was once like the men he teaches. A self-professed loser, or \"diaosi,\" Zhang Mindong said he suffered a painful breakup in 2012. He turned to the internet to find solutions and discovered the term \"pick-up artist.\" Zhang Mindong started his school in the eastern city of Jinan in 2014, which he now runs with Cui Yihao, 25, and Fan Long, 29. Their services range from $45 for an online course to about $3,000 for one-on-one coaching. Similar schools have opened in several Chinese cities in recent years. The number of students who take offline courses at \"Fall in Love Emotional Education\" has grown from one in 2014, to more than 300 now, according to Zhang Mindong. About 90 percent of graduates end up with girlfriends, he said. At the October session, there was Yu Ruitong, a 23-year-old software developer who had three previous relationships; Ye Chaoqun, a 27-year-old small business owner who is hoping to make the woman he likes fall in love with him; and James Zhang, a 30-year-old cancer doctor who is looking to expand the circle of women he knows. Both Mr. Ye and James Zhang have returned to polish what they learned earlier — this time free of charge. To show his students what they were up against, Zhang Mindong held up a profile of an attractive woman on a dating app that had garnered \"likes\" from 7,000 men. \"This is the environment in China,\" he said. In the first hour, Zhang Mindong proclaimed them sartorial disasters. Most of the first day was devoted to improving dress. (\"Narrow collars, sleeves should be folded up above the elbow and trousers should be fitted.\") They bought clothes and got haircuts. \"After getting into a relationship with a woman, many Chinese men let themselves go. They don’t wash their hair, change their clothes and become really dirty,\" said Zhang Mindong, who was wearing hip glasses and a fitted white shirt. \"But that’s not the case for women, and this is why so many Chinese men can’t have a long-term relationship.\" The makeovers are followed by the students posing for photos — reading Stephen Hawking’s \"A Brief History of Time,\" sipping tea and nibbling canapés presented in a silver bird cage, looking pensively out a window. That culminated in selfies with Wang Zhen, a female friend of Mr. Cui’s. That’s designed for dating in the digital era. In China, where the mobile internet has revolutionized social life, getting to know a person takes place almost exclusively on WeChat, a popular social media tool that is used by nearly 1 billion people. Most social interactions in China usually start or end with people scanning each other’s WeChat QR codes — a practice known as saoing — or adding each other’s WeChat IDs. Many women form their impressions of men based on photographs on WeChat’s \"Moments,\" a Facebook-like tool. On a Thursday night outside a busy shopping mall in Jinan, the students got their first challenge: approach women and ask for their WeChat contacts. \"You give her two choices: ‘Why don’t you add me or I sao you?’\" Zhang Mindong told the students. \"So no matter what she picks, you’ll succeed.\" After practicing their moves on Ms. Wang, the students set off. Zhang Zhenxiao rushed up to two women, who paused but continued walking. He chased after them and stopped them again. After a minute, they walked away. \"I didn’t succeed,\" a dejected Mr. Zhang said, returning to the group. \"No, the fact that you approached them means you did,\" Mr. Cui said, patting him on the back. By the end of the night, all the students had obtained at least one WeChat contact. The classes, held in an apartment on the grounds of Shandong University, have an air of brotherly camaraderie — the students, huddled together on a floral couch scribbling in notebooks, practiced real smiles and flirtatious banter with their coaches. A materials buyer for a renovations company, Zhang Zhenxiao said he had never learned how to talk to a woman. His high school forbade students from mixing with members of the opposite sex. His parents had an arranged marriage. Now, they are giving him pressure to settle down. He is on a quest for his ideal woman — a bubbly tomboy who likes wearing jeans and not skirts all the time. \"I think there are many single women who are just like me,\" he said, \"all longing for love.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/business/china-dating-schools.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Jet Pilot Might Not Seem Like a ‘Gig,’ but at Ryanair, It Is', 'text': ' At a recent shareholders’ meeting in Dublin, Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, slumped into a leather chair and issued a mea culpa. Under his watch, Europe’s biggest low-cost airline had bungled its fall vacation schedule for pilots. Over 2,000 flights would have to be canceled. To contain the crisis, Ryanair might cut a week of vacation from the airline’s 4,200 pilots — many of whom aren’t full-time employees but independent contractors. If they \"misbehaved\" by declining to help, he added, they would get no \"goodies\" in the future. It wasn’t the first provocative comment from Mr. O’Leary, a pugnacious leader who transformed Europe’s airline industry with an aggressive cost-cutting approach that extended to the work force. But this time, he prompted an outcry within Ryanair’s ranks. Days later, Mr. O’Leary was forced to announce an additional 18,000 flight cancellations, after some pilots balked about returning to the air. Employees have banded together to demand collective bargaining and more secure contracts, touching off a fresh clash with management. Last week, 59 pilots representing employees across Europe renewed those demands, adding that \"pilots have had enough.\" The tensions at Ryanair are flaring at a time when labor practices are being debated across Europe. As businesses look to squeeze costs, around a third of the European work force is now in an alternative employment arrangement, rather than in full-time, regular employment. Such employees don’t usually require the same level of benefits for health care, retirement and unemployment. The European Commission is pushing for tougher social protections for this increasingly flexible work force. While the scrutiny has focused on gig economy companies like Uber, it is increasingly extending broadly to a contractor class that includes construction workers, accountants and even pilots. Ryanair controls its expenses by using a mix of full-time employees and self-employed pilots recruited through outside agencies. It also issues Irish work contracts to cabin crew and senior pilots around Europe, arguing that they work in Irish-registered aircraft and not in the countries where they are based. The approach helps Ryanair sidestep labor regulations and high social security taxes in many of the 33 countries where it operates, making its labor costs among the lowest in the European industry. Those costs run around 2 euros per employee per hour flown — less than half the costs of two rivals, easyJet and Norwegian Air. European regulators have been investigating the employment agencies Ryanair used to recruit new pilots. In Germany and Britain, authorities are examining alleged tax evasion at the agencies. Ryanair’s use of Irish labor contracts have faced legal challenges in several countries that have accused the carrier of failing to pay social security. The company’s practices are also feeding employees’ frustrations. In interviews, more than a dozen current and former pilots and crew members described demanding work conditions and atypical employment arrangements that made it difficult to voice complaints. Most agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, citing nondisclosure agreements in Ryanair contracts and concerns about jeopardizing their jobs. \"If travelers can fly for just 10 euros, they should know that part of that cost comes from the labor conditions of the airline personnel,\" said Yves Jorens, a professor of social law at Ghent University and the co-author of an extensive 2015 report on work conditions in the European aviation industry. The uproar over vacations has emboldened employees to assert themselves. Hundreds of Ryanair staffers have sought to join European airline unions, form informal collectives and create a Europe-wide representative body to push for change. Unions at Southwest Airlines and American Airlines are offering help. Ryanair has vowed not to meet with or recognize any union. Its concern is that rivals are capitalizing on the flight cancellation episode to organize Ryanair’s pilots and crew members — a move that analysts say would hurt the company’s advantage in low labor costs. Mr. O’Leary declined requests for an interview. But in letters and public statements, he repeatedly blamed airline unions and competitors, saying they tried to \"demean and disparage our collective success,\" a charge he has renewed in recent weeks. Yet as rumors swirled that pilots were defecting to other carriers after the flight cancellations, Mr. O’Leary issued an impassioned plea. \"Ryanair’s pilots are the best in the business,\" he said in a message to employees last month, in which he also promised improved pay and better contracts. \"I urge you to stay with Ryanair for a better brighter future.\" When Robertus Van Boekel applied for a pilot’s job at Ryanair in 2009, he interviewed at Brookfield Aviation, a British personnel agency. Ryanair rarely hired new pilots directly. Instead, they were told to take the unusual step of applying to Brookfield or McGinley Aviation, another British recruiter, and declare themselves as self-employed. Brookfield handed Mr. Van Boekel, who was based in Belgium, a list of Irish accounting firms and told him to choose one, according to a 2013 lawsuit that Brookfield brought against Mr. Van Boekel when he resigned to work at another carrier. The accountants made him a shareholder and director of a Dublin-based \"service company\" called Winged Foot Ltd. Brookfield then arranged for the company to supply Mr. Van Boekel’s piloting services to Ryanair, the suit said. After German authorities began investigating Brookfield, Ryanair last summer turned to a new employment company to contract pilots, BlueSky Resources, set up by an agency called Crewlink that the carrier uses to hire flight crew. McGinley Aviation and Crewlink declined to comment. A spokeswoman at Brookfield, Elaine He, said it was no longer handling pilot recruitment for Ryanair. The labor setup is key to an elaborate cost-cutting strategy that Mr. O’Leary pioneered in the mid-1990s, when the European air travel market was liberalized. Until then, big national carriers like Alitalia, Air France and Lufthansa had commanded the Continent, with a corps of unionized pilots. Mr. O’Leary followed the low-cost model of Southwest Airlines in Dallas, now the world’s biggest airline in terms of passengers. Southwest had minimized operating costs and lured fliers from legacy carriers by offering cheap, bare-bones flights. He honed the approach for Ryanair, putting hubs in inexpensive European locales that generated new tourism and jobs. Fuel costs were rigorously managed, and turnaround times for flights squeezed to the fastest in the industry. The company uses only Boeing jets to reduce engineering costs, and leases part of its fleet to recoup tax write-offs. And it avoided unionization, a strategy that some low-cost European rivals have copied, along with Ryanair’s tactic of using contract pilots to cut costs. Mr. O’Leary cultivated a brash image, poking competitors, pilots and Ryanair’s own customers. At the shareholders meeting, he angered pilots by saying they had an \"easy job.\" He once proposed charging passengers to use the toilet, and placing higher fares on \"fat people.\" None of that happened. But Ryanair’s ticket prices — as low as €10 from London to Rome — were a game changer. Ryanair is now Europe’s biggest carrier, and the fifth largest in the world, with 117 million passengers in 2016. Profits tripled over the past decade to €1 billion and remain robust even after Ryanair refunded €25 million to 700,000 passengers recently for the cancellations. Ryanair is also a fast-track opportunity for young pilots and crew members to accumulate experience and jump to another airline. Those promoted to captain can earn a six-figure salary on a full-time contract. But employees were often blindsided by the labor setup once they were inside, according to the current and former Ryanair pilots and crew members. Thousands of new Ryanair pilots went through the same process as Mr. Van Boekel. Some were required to form limited liability companies in several countries with pilots they didn’t know. As contractors, they didn’t receive standard benefits for pensions or health insurance. Pilots and flight attendants on Ryanair’s Irish contracts weren’t always protected by labor laws in the countries where they worked. Ryanair said its contracts complied with labor laws in Ireland and the European Union. Pay has been another concern. Self-employed pilots and aircrew members are paid only for hours flown, but not for time spent preparing for a flight, or when they are delayed or canceled. Minimum monthly work hours were promised though not guaranteed. Contractor pilots paid their own transportation and costly hotel bills when assigned to fly from different airports. Like flight crews, they said they shelled out for uniforms, food and even drinking water on flights. Ryanair said that staff members received allowances to defray the costs of uniforms and other expenses. The company’s go-to employment agencies required job seekers to pay for qualification training, starting at around €2,500 for flight attendants and about €30,000 for pilots. When tax authorities raided Ryanair’s German sites as part of their investigation into alleged tax evasion by Brookfield Aviation, they also questioned pilots who had signed contracts with Brookfield. That set off a mild panic among Ryanair pilots elsewhere in Europe with the same contracts. Pilots, in interviews, said they felt discouraged from raising workplace concerns, which could lead to being called into Dublin for tense meetings with managers. Others recounted being pressured to limit their fuel consumption and fearful of being reprimanded if they complained of fatigue. Flight attendants reported coming to work ill and scrambling to fulfill sales quotas on flights for lottery cards, perfumes and other items to avoid rebuke by managers. Ryanair said it did not limit fuel consumption and that its aircraft take off with fuel exceeding E.U. safety guidelines. The company disputed reprimanding staff for complaining of fatigue or illness. One former pilot recalled protesting after being told to pay for a costly taxi ride to another airport to fill in for a colleague. Managers suggested he could be demoted if he didn’t comply. It created a culture of fear, he said. Robin Kiely, Ryanair’s spokesman, said that claims of workplace pressures were \"false and invented,\" fomented by unions seeking to undermine Ryanair. \"There is no pressure on people here,\" he said. \"We certainly work hard, but we work smart.\" Mr. Kiely said employees enjoyed favorable conditions and unmatched job security. \"We have 13,000 employees,\" he said. \"If it was so bad, they wouldn’t be working here.\" Ryanair employees have made various attempts to unionize. Each time, the effort has been rebuffed. James Atkinson, a pilot who flew with Ryanair for eight years, said that when he started in Rome in 2006, the company pressured crew members who tried to organize. People who participated in those organizing efforts were reassigned to other airports outside of Italy where Ryanair operates. Those who refused to relocate were fired; others eventually retracted their demands, he said. Later, Mr. Atkinson created his own website to try to organize Ryanair employees. Soon after, he said, Brookfield declined to renew his contract. \"I was pushing for organization and my contract was terminated,\" Mr. Atkinson said. Ryanair said he was dismissed for \"misconduct,\" although it would not specify what that was. Today he is a pilot at a rapidly expanding airline in China. In 2011, Belgium-based Ryanair flight attendants on Irish contracts sued for the right to claim Belgian pay and entitlements in the nation’s courts. Ryanair had claimed that disputes involving Irish contracts could be heard only in Ireland, where benefits like unemployment insurance and social security were less favorable than in Belgium. One attendant, Virginie Mauguit, who had been with the carrier for over two years, approached a local union for advice. She distributed union leaflets to crew members describing their rights under Belgian labor law. Two weeks later, Ms. Mauguit received notice that she was fired for previously missing work days, she said. \"People don’t have the right to complain,\" she said. \"It was dangerous for your job.\" The European Court of Justice ultimately ruled in September that aircrew could pursue their rights in the country where they work. Mr. O’Leary declared victory because the court didn’t bar Ryanair from continuing to issue Irish contracts. But in his letter to employees, he said Ryanair might close gaps in benefits between Irish contracts and local labor laws. The autumn scheduling breakdown brought the issue to the forefront again, hitting not only morale but also the corporate suite. Amid the tumult, Ryanair dropped a bid to buy the ailing airline Alitalia. Mr. O’Leary hired a former top executive to address the turmoil, started a recruitment drive and warned pilots about \"misinformation\" from competitors’ unions. A message sent to former pilots to try to hire them back said Ryanair was working to \"significantly transform and reward the way we interact with our pilots.\" Staff members at Ryanair have continued to fight back, calling on Mr. O’Leary to change the contractor model and improve working conditions. Growing numbers are pressing Ryanair to conduct collective bargaining and recognize a Europe-wide management committee that they organized, rather than negotiate through managers at each Ryanair site. Ryanair maintains that it will only recognize management committees at each of its bases. Pilots in London and in Madrid recently revolted against an offer for pay increases on the condition that they agree to continue negotiating with Ryanair directly. Many are now trying to spread the message more widely via WhatsApp and Facebook. \"Pilots have said enough is enough: we like this company but we don’t accept the terms and conditions any more,\" said Dirk Polloczek, president of the European Cockpit Association, representing more than 38,000 pilots across Europe. \"They think Ryanair can be a good employer,\" he added. \"All they have to do is have a dialogue with their pilots.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/business/ryanair-pilots.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'How to Profit From Time Warner’s Troubles', 'text': ' Since the Trump administration began sending out signals that the Time Warner-AT&T merger was facing close scrutiny, Time Warner’s high-flying share price has fallen to earth. From a closing high of $103.64 on Oct. 5, Time Warner is now trading at about $89, a decline of roughly 14 percent. Amid reports of a possible suit by the Justice Department to block the deal on antitrust grounds, the share price could easily drop further. There seems to be a compelling reason for the market reaction: Unless AT&T acquires it, Time Warner simply doesn’t appear to be worth the price its shares were commanding. But there is a competing perspective: The market may well be making a mistake. \"I think Time Warner is probably worth a lot more than the market is saying now,\" said Brian Wieser, senior research analyst with the Pivotal Research Group. \"I think the deal will ultimately be completed. And the price will go up if the deal goes through — we know that for sure. It will also go up if another company comes in and makes a deal for Time Warner. \"And there’s very little downside risk,\" he continued. \"The company is worth close to what it’s trading at now if there is no merger of any kind. It’s one of those situations that you like to see.\" In fact, Time Warner’s falling share price — and what Mr. Wieser considered to be its compelling valuations — induced him on Monday to upgrade his rating on the stock from \"hold\" to \"buy.\" Time Warner’s troubles looked to him like a buying opportunity. Alan S. Gould, senior media and internet analyst with Rosenblatt Securities, had a similar reaction. On the same day as Mr. Wieser, he upgraded Time Warner to \"buy,\" saying the stock \"now offers the most compelling risk/reward in our coverage universe.\" AT&T’s merger offer makes Time Warner worth $103 a share if the deal takes place, he noted (and the merger offer rises to $107.50 per Time Warner share if AT&T’s own shares rise above a certain threshold). It may take until April instead of the end of 2017 to complete the merger if the Department of Justice \"decides to sue to block the deal,\" he wrote. \"If the deal falls apart, which we do not expect, we believe there is minimal downside.\" The analysts’ logic is straightforward. First, consider what Time Warner’s stock price has been telling us. Only several weeks ago, the stock market gauged the probability of the deal’s completion at virtually 100 percent. By Wednesday, that had plummeted well below 50 percent. But there’s money to be made if it turns out that the market’s assessment of one month ago was more accurate than its judgment of today. Figuring out these probabilities involves several factors: computing the price that AT&T would pay for Time Warner in a completed merger, which depends, in part, on where AT&T’s own price stands at that moment; assessing Time Warner’s value without a merger of any kind; and comparing those numbers with Time Warner’s current price. This kind of calculation is standard practice on Wall Street. As a merger draws close to culmination, the price of the soon-to-be acquired stock tends to converge with the price that the stock will be worth in the merger. That convergence had occurred in this case. For weeks, Time Warner shares traded at a price equal to that ultimate merger value, reflecting the market’s view that the deal was a fait accompli. But the Trump administration’s negative messages changed Wall Street’s calculus. The current price indicates that the market believes that AT&T, a communications company hungry for compelling news and entertainment programs, is unlikely ever to own Time Warner or its enticing properties. They include HBO, with its immensely powerful \"Game of Thrones\" franchise, and CNN, the pioneering cable news network, which President Trump has called a purveyor of \"fake news\" filled with \"really dishonest people.\" The antitrust issues involved are complex. I have no strong view on which way a suit would go. As my colleague James B. Stewart has pointed out, the proposed combination is what is known as a \"vertical merger,\" resembling Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011. That deal was approved, with conditions aimed at ensuring Comcast’s impartiality toward its competitors. But such vertical mergers may not be in the public interest, critics like Tim Wu, the Columbia law school professor, have argued. Mr. Trump’s evident animus toward CNN complicates matters, making a prediction more difficult — and, quite likely, damaging Time Warner’s share price. Assume for a moment that the merger is ultimately completed. Then, Time Warner is undervalued now. But even if the merger collapses, Mr. Wieser said, Time Warner is already in play and is likely to be acquired by another suitor. That, too, would make it undervalued. Next assume that Time Warner stays independent. Its earnings have been strong, Mr. Gould said, and its cash reserves would enable it to buy back perhaps $7 billion of its own stock, bolstering its price. Mr. Wieser said an independent Time Warner would probably be worth about $81 a share, a modest decline. Buying now is a risk, he acknowledged, adding, \"It’s not a big risk, and the potential reward is high.\" For individuals who are saving for retirement, there is another risk. The overall stock market has been rising for years, but it could fall, pulling most stocks down with it, especially those that already have downward momentum. Buying a stock like Time Warner now may be best for those with strong convictions or deep pockets or, ideally, both. But Time Warner’s troubles could be a profit opportunity for investors.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/business/how-to-profit-from-time-warners-troubles.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'How Cutting Taxes Makes Life Worse for the Rich', 'text': ' The Republican effort to cut federal taxes is still underway, and many crucial details are still unsettled. But little doubt remains that the effort has been heavily shaped by wealthy donors. As Chris Collins, a Republican representative from New York put it: \"My donors are basically saying, ‘Get it done or don’t ever call me again.’\" Many affluent people are likely to celebrate if an eventual deal in Washington grants them big tax breaks. Evidence suggests, however, that their jubilation would be short-lived — and followed by deep disappointment. It is perfectly natural, of course, to believe that extra cash will help them buy the special things they want, such as more spacious homes or better performing cars. But that belief is a garden-variety cognitive error. The mistake occurs because \"special\" is an inescapably relative concept. A spacious home is one that is larger than most other homes. A high-performance car is one that outperforms most other cars. Successful bidding for such things depends almost entirely on relative purchasing power. Taxes affect absolute purchasing power, not relative purchasing power. The upshot is that the ability of the already rich to bid successfully for special things is not enhanced by tax cuts. Why isn’t this simple truth more widely appreciated? In thinking about how taxes affect us, we try to imagine how life would be different if we had less money. And when we recall examples of actual events that left us with less money — think home fires, job losses, business downturns, divorces, serious illnesses and the like — in almost every case, it really was more difficult for us to buy things we wanted. But such events merely reduce our own incomes while leaving others’ unaffected. They reduce our relative purchasing power. Matters unfold differently when everyone’s spendable income goes down together, as when all pay higher taxes. In that case, our relative purchasing power remains the same as before. Because virtually every human evaluation depends on context, the category of goods whose accessibility depends overwhelmingly on relative purchasing power is far broader than might appear. Suppose, for example, that you’re driving with your 6-year-old to visit her grandparents and she asks, \"Are we almost there yet?\" You’ll say \"yes\" if only 10 miles remain on a 120-mile journey. But you’ll say \"no\" if that same distance remains on a journey of only 12 miles. Similarly, someone in Miami knows the answer if someone asks whether it’s cold on a 60-degree day in November. But her answer will be different from that of someone in Montreal who is asked whether it’s cold on a 60-degree day in March. Little wonder, then, that context shapes our evaluations of virtually every purchase we might consider. The standards that define \"special\" are therefore highly elastic. When everyone buys larger houses and faster cars, or stages more elaborate wedding celebrations, standards adjust accordingly. Failure to appreciate that reality has also contributed to the tax resistance that has made it so difficult to restore America’s crumbling public infrastructure. Even proponents of minimal government concede that private cars would be of little use without public roads. And although it’s difficult to reach agreement on the best mix of public and private spending, studies show that the current mix in the United States is strongly biased against public spending. My research on this issue over many decades has identified the following thought experiment as an instructive way to view this problem. Imagine that you are a wealthy car enthusiast facing two options: Driving a Porsche 911 Turbo (purchase price: less than $160,000) on well-maintained highways, or driving a Ferrari F12 Berlinetta (purchase price: more than $320,000) on roads riddled with foot-deep potholes. Which would you choose? It’s an easy question. Suppose that the Ferrari would universally be judged better if both cars were driven on good roads. But since the Porsche already has every design feature that affects performance significantly, the Ferrari’s edge would be tiny at most. No one could reasonably claim that the Ferrari would be more pleasing to drive on pothole-ridden roads than the Porsche on well-maintained ones. Yet, among the super-wealthy, the actual quality mix of cars and highways in the United States more closely resembles Ferraris on potholes than Porsches on smooth asphalt. That’s puzzling, since the latter combination could be achieved at much lower total expense. This distortion is in large part a consequence of the cognitive error just described: What happens when any one person spends less on a car is very different from what happens when everyone spends less. In the former case, the buyer feels deprived. But when everyone spends less, the relevant frame of reference shifts, leaving drivers just as satisfied as before. The same logic applies not just to cars and highways, but also to a broad mix of personal and public priorities. The American tax system is indeed deeply dysfunctional. But the consensus among tax-policy economists from both sides of the political aisle is that the proposals under consideration are not the reforms we need. Rate cuts for top earners would greatly increase budget deficits and do little or nothing to spur growth. Others have objected that they would make a skewed income distribution even more unequal. Fair points all. But elections have consequences, and Republicans have never hidden their desire to cut taxes. They now have the power to do so. But it would be a mistake to exercise that power. Tax cuts for the wealthy would not alter the supply of special things to be had. And by increasing government deficits substantially, they would degrade our infrastructure in ways that would harm even the ostensible beneficiaries of those cuts. In short, cutting taxes for the wealthy is a losing proposition — even for the wealthy.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/business/tax-cuts-rich.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Nonprofits Give ‘Disconnected’ Youths Another Chance', 'text': ' Jonathan’s father always told him he would never amount to anything other than a drug dealer. He entered the foster care system when he was 12. At 18, he was in college, but had to drop out to take care of his ill grandmother. \"I always told myself I would graduate college and wouldn’t be a statistic in the foster care system,\" said Jonathan, 26, who gave only his first name to protect his privacy. But at 21, he was homeless and jobless. \"One day I Googled ‘help with foster kids aging out,’\" Jonathan said, and he found Youth Villages, one of the national nonprofits aimed at stopping the downward spiral of people like him. He now lives in an off-campus apartment at Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts, drives part time for Uber to help support himself and will graduate in December with a bachelor’s degree in management with a concentration in operations. Youth Villages is one of the nonprofits highlighted in this year’s annual giving guide released on Monday by the Center for High Impact Philanthropy  at the University of Pennsylvania. The center, which researches and promotes charities that offer the most effective social good in specific areas, says one in eight people ages 16 to 24, or 4.9 million nationally, are considered disconnected, meaning that they don’t have a job and are not in high school or college. The rate is considerably higher in rural areas than urban ones. While these numbers have dropped since the depth of the Great Recession, the impact of that economic turmoil is still reverberating. Yet too often, this population is ignored. \"We’re always looking at philanthropic opportunities for great positive change, and this is one,\" said Katherina M. Rosqueta, founding executive director of the center. \"These young adults – when you are able to intervene at this time, you can change the trajectory of their lives.\" Almost all the people served by the nonprofits identified by the center are low-income. Many are already parents themselves, and a significant number have been in the foster care system their entire lives and are virtually on their own when they age out, typically at 18. Providing intensive guidance and training during this time can stop the descent into chronic homelessness and lifelong reliance on government services, Ms. Rosqueta said. Other factors make it tougher for these young people to succeed. Many have been tangled up in the criminal justice system and, with limited recourse to medical services, some struggle with mental illness, which often first makes an appearance in the late teens or early 20s. Even well-meaning people think that those in their late teens and early 20s are already beyond help, said David Abromowitz, chief public policy officer of YouthBuild USA. \"They say, ‘I want to work with children.’ I say, ‘Who do you think are the parents to those children?’\" For example, he said, about 30 percent of those enrolled in YouthBuild have children. \"People need to understand something actually works with this population,\" Mr. Abromowitz said. Youth Villages helps emotionally and behaviorally troubled children succeed by working with them and their families; YVLifeset, a part of Youth Villages, is aimed at people 17 to 22 years old. It is an intensive six- to 12-month program to support, guide and encourage participants, most of whom grew up in the foster care system. The statistics for those who spent their childhood in foster care is dismal: At age 21, half are unemployed, one in five is homeless, and almost 70 percent have been involved in the criminal justice system. Since 1999, YVLifeset has served more than 11,000 young adults in seven states, and is beginning to partner with other nonprofits and state and local governments to replicate the model. The idea, said Patrick Lawler, the chief executive of Youth Villages, is for counselors, known as specialists, to offer the resources that other parents give their children every day. They have a small caseload – only eight at a time – and meet with their clients one to two times a week. Kelly Conlin, the educational and vocational coordinator for YVLifeset in Massachusetts, said part of her role was not to tell her clients what to do but to find out what goals they have for themselves. She often meets them at a local McDonald’s or Dunkin’ Donuts, helping them to find the resources they need, whether it be signing up for food stamps, finding mental health care, learning a trade, finishing high school or getting into college. \"I get them set up for the next stage in life,\" she said. And just as important, or even more so, she offers them stability and support, something most have never experienced. \"I say, ‘I know you can do this’ – a lot of them had adults who discouraged them,\" Ms. Conlin said. \"I show them how it’s attainable and help them build confidence. A lot feel their voices have never been heard.\" A five-year independent study by MDRC, a research organization, found that compared with a randomly selected control group, YVLifeset participants show decreases in homelessness and violent relationships and increases in earnings. While such programs have been shown to do good work, \"social policy change is also needed,\" said Mark E. Courtney, a professor at the University of Chicago in the School of Social Service Administration, who has long studied child welfare policy and services. The nonprofits, no matter how good, \"are only able to serve a small proportion of the population who could benefit from them.\" But, said Professor Courtney, who was one of the authors of the independent study, the best organizations helping young adults are committed to learning what works and what doesn’t. And they have found that just as important as offering their participants real-world skills is providing a place where they are welcomed rather than spurned. \"These programs do what good parents do: They have faith that we will do well in the world,\" he said, adding that those who participate in the programs generally say, \"‘I was welcome, they had faith in me, they’re not afraid of me.’ And that’s really important, because the messages they get from society is the opposite.\" Respect was something Taryn Canty-Reed, 20, felt instantly when she joined YouthBuild, a national yearlong program that helps those 16 to 24 years old earn a diploma or high-school equivalency certificate and learn a trade. She tried some other programs, but nothing clicked. YouthBuild, she said, \"makes me feel like a new and different Taryn.\" It’s not only the skills she’s acquiring, but also that the staff members \"acknowledge the good stuff.\" \"They don’t down-talk,\" she said. \"They pay attention and listen.\" She started at YouthBuild Philadelphia two months ago and is working in the GreenBuild construction training track, learning to build solar panels and other sustainable energy products. Her goal is go on to a local community college, major in business and construction and then start her own business. The first YouthBuild program started in the 1970s as an experiment in East Harlem in New York City to get low-income youths to rebuild vacant and dilapidated homes in their own community. In 1992, Congress created the federal YouthBuild program and it is now part of the federal Department of Labor. It receives funding from AmeriCorps, as well as corporate, private and foundation grants. Now, there are 230 YouthBuild programs in the United States and 80 internationally. Programs are often housed within a larger nonprofit, such as a YMCA or housing development. Although the emphasis is on the construction trade at many YouthBuild programs, in Philadelphia, the largest YouthBuild program, students can get a certificate in one of four areas: construction building trades; customer service and business administration; child care; and health care. Nationally, 75 percent complete the program, 74 percent receive a high school diploma or certificate, and a little more than half go on to jobs or higher education. Some organizations are aimed at those young adults who have graduated from high school, but flounder when they are either unable or unwilling to go on to higher education. The goal of Year Up, a national nonprofit, is to get motivated 18- to 24-year-olds with high-school diplomas or equivalency certificates ready for corporate internships that often lead to jobs, said Gerald Chertavian, founder and chief executive of Year Up. The program, which started in 2000, provides a six-month course, where students must dress in professional attire, be respectful and be on time and ready every day for their classes from 8:30 to 3:30 – or risk having their stipend docked or being kicked out of the program. It has 22 locations across the country, some within community colleges, and about 19,000 young adults have gone through the program; the students earn 20 to 30 college credits if they finish it. Almost 30 percent are homeless or don’t have stable housing, Mr. Chertavian said. And almost half have been exposed to violence or trauma. But he also has a more cheerful statistic: Ninety-one percent of his graduates get a full-time job with an average salary of $40,000. Kerry Sullivan, president of the Bank of America Charitable Foundation, who also sits on Year Up’s board, said that of the 470 interns the bank has hired through the program since 2004, 170 have gone on to full-time jobs. \"The journey began as a philanthropic one, but as time went on, we’re now looking at it as a pipeline,\" she said, Although not everyone succeeds, even with the help of such programs, those who do make it through often see them as lifesavers. \"If I hadn’t gone there, I believe that I would have been part of the 97 percent who age out of foster care who don’t graduate college,\" Jonathan, the student at Bridgewater State University, said of of Youth Villages. \"I would have lived paycheck to paycheck. Even more important, he said, they \"believed in me.\" he said. \"I never had anyone believe in me.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/disconnected-youths.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '', 'text': '', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/business/corporate-philanthropy.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'In Oregon, You Can Now Save for Retirement. Unless You Object.', 'text': ' The lack of retirement savings among Americans is almost universally bemoaned but nudging, prodding and lecturing have done little to build up nest eggs for old age. So some states say they are going to make it easier to save with a simple plan: an automatic payroll deduction for retirement savings. Oregon is the first state to roll out a plan that covers private sector workers who do not otherwise have access to a savings plan in their workplace. The deduction is an automatic 5 percent of gross pay, unless the worker opts out. Participants can reduce the percentage, if they choose. The state directs the money gathered under the OregonSaves plan to privately run low-cost investment funds. With its heavy concentration of small businesses, Oregon calculates that it has more than one million workers whose employers do not offer a retirement savings vehicle. Many small employers say they cannot afford the expense or time to set up such plans. Luke Huffstutter, who co-owns a hair salon in Portland, was among them. \"I had looked into setting up an employee savings plan. We met with four different companies but the plans were either too expensive or the fees were too high,\" said Mr. Huffstutter, who, with his wife, Natasha, owns Annastasia Salon. When he heard about OregonSaves, the state’s pass-through savings plan, Mr. Huffstutter signed up right away. The program’s first phase began July 1, with 11 businesses participating, including the hair salon, a liquor store, a day care center and a chocolate maker. All employers who pay unemployment insurance for their workers are required to sign up by 2020 — about 60,000 workplaces and 600,000 workers. \"It’s genius because people are signed up and participate unless they actively decide they won’t,\" Mr. Huffstutter said. Most of the salon’s three dozen stylists and other employees enrolled. They included Maria Rose Isaac, 26, the salon manager. \"I don’t have a retirement plan, but it was always on my mind,\" said Ms. Isaac, who has worked at the salon for seven years. \"This is the easiest, simplest way to have some savings.\" Worker reception has been more mixed elsewhere, including at S & S Sheetmetal Inc., a family-owned air conditioning and heating business in White City, Ore., where about half of the 30 workers have opted out, said Christie Calkins, the office manager. \"Some had their own plan and some are concerned about a plan that has the government involved,\" she said. To address any wariness about state-run pensions, Oregon structures its program so the state is only a conduit for funds. Savers can choose among investment options. OregonSaves offers three — preserving capital, growth and savings for a target date. Participants pay 1 percent of their total assets in annual fees and can withdraw their money without penalties. Eight states have similar but not identical programs in the works, including New Jersey, Massachusetts, Vermont and Washington, according to AARP, which has lobbied in support of the state-sponsored plans. California and Illinois are expected to start their versions in 2018. Maryland and Connecticut plan to follow soon after. Oregon was an early adopter; its legislature approved the retirement savings plan in 2015. The Obama administration tried to bolster state efforts to promote retirement savings by relaxing the strict rules and reporting requirements that employer-based retirement plans and pensions must follow. Last May, Congress repealed those rules, leaving states on their own. \"The basic idea was to do this federally, but states had to step into the breach,\" said J. Mark Iwry, a former Treasury Department official a co-author of President Barack Obama’s automatic I.R.A. enrollment legislation — which has never been enacted federally but which states are putting into effect. \"Many states are waiting to see how Oregon does with its plan.\" States like California, whose planned program could cover as many as seven million people, would most likely operate with some variation of paycheck savings — unless there is a real glitch in the Oregon program. \"What spurred states to take action was actually federal inaction,\" said Sarah Mysiewicz Gill, senior legislative representative for AARP. Despite bipartisan support, there has been no concerted response on the federal level, so \"states looked at this and realized they could do for retirement what they did with 529 college savings plans.\" Nearly half of Americans of all ages have little or no money set aside for their later years, according to several experts. Overall, the shortfall is estimated at nearly $7 trillion, the National Institute on Retirement Security found. As a result, there could be a tremendous drain on municipal coffers by older people who require more health, housing and other services. Even a modest amount of savings could make a difference, AARP has found. If lower-income retirees were able to increase their retirement incomes by as little as $1,000 a year, Oregon could save $98.9 million on public assistance programs between 2018 and 2032, according to the organization’s analysis. Those figures have encouraged state efforts. \"People are 15 times more likely to save, and save more, with payroll deductions,\" said Tobias Read, Oregon’s state treasurer and chairman of the Oregon Retirement Savings Board. The plan, Mr. Read said, was built on the ideas of Richard M. Thaler, the winner of the 2017 Nobel Prize for economics, who advocates payroll savings plans as essentially \"the only way that middle-class Americans reliably save for retirement. Your grandmother probably knew that the best way to save money is to put money aside before you have a chance to spend it. That approach has always worked — and is a core idea embedded in these plans,\" Mr. Thaler wrote in a 2013 New York Times column. OregonSaves is facing its first legal challenge, however. The Erisa Industry Committee, a trade group of the country’s 100 largest employers, filed a federal lawsuit in October saying that Oregon created confusing and unnecessary paperwork for companies already complying with federal pension law. That’s likely not to be the only challenge. Some small business owners strongly object to being required to handle more paperwork, and the financial sector complains that government should not be involved in private savings. Oregon’s plan caps the amount a worker can save at $5,500 a year, and $6,500 for those 50 and older, which means that even rigorous savers will need to set aside more than the state plan allows. \"This is nothing magical,\" Mr. Read said. \"We’re trying to promote a culture of savings. But we’re doing it deliberately and cautiously.\" Since July, about 75 percent of workers automatically enrolled in OregonSaves have stayed in the program, according to the Oregon State Treasurer’s Office. To date, upward of 2,400 employees working for more than 50 employers have saved just under $200,000. Participants can automatically increase their savings by 1 percent annually, to a maximum of 10 percent. In Portland, Mr. Huffstutter said the payroll deduction plan took the salon minimal time to set up and maintain, and fills a gap in the beauty industry, where salons like his are often too small to offer retirement plans. \"The stylists here have an average age of 28, and make about $48,000 annually, but retirement savings are not at all routine,\" he said. \"The plan helps close the loop and gives them an automatic option to be able to save starting at an early age.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/your-money/oregon-save-for-retirement.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Milling 66 Acres of Oats (Every Hour) Without a Hitch', 'text': ' Charlie Mossman, 61, a shift lead, keeps the daytime oat milling operation running fluidly at Quaker Oats Company in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Q. What is your role at Quaker Oats? A: I supervise the milling operation on the first shift and make sure every process runs efficiently. One involves cleaning the raw oats, fresh from harvesting, and removing sticks or other debris. Another removes the hull, or outer covering, from the edible groat. Still other processes are drying and grading. I’ve been here 30 years, five of those as shift lead. Before this position I was a miller, and I still jump in if we need to work overtime to meet our production goals. What’s involved in ensuring the operation runs smoothly? I spend about 10 percent of my time in the control room, monitoring the instruments and seeing that the actual weight of the load being processed matches the figures on a computer screen. We call the board on which we track our yields our \"run right\" board because if the numbers match, everything’s running smoothly. I also go over work orders from the previous shift and walk around to check the scales and make sure the oat flows aren’t plugged up. Every hour our three shifts mill, or clean and separate, roughly 66 acres of oats, which is about 49 football fields. What might surprise people about your job? Our older mill has 14 floors. To travel between them, I step onto a small wooden platform attached to a vertical conveyor belt, grab the hand grip and ride the belt. If it breaks down, I have to walk up and down the steps. You find out how fit you are; I feel it in my legs those days. What’s a constant in your job? I’m always a little anxious when we’re implementing a new process. As an example, five years ago we started installing optical sorting technology. I lost sleep because I wanted everything to go well. What’s a memorable moment from your career? In 2013 my boss nominated me for a Chairman’s Circle of Champions award and I was one of the winners. The company sent my wife and me to New York for a week. I’m a Midwest farm boy. I’ve been to Chicago, but New York was something else. I was a little surprised I won; I’m just a regular guy doing my job. What was another break from routine? Several years ago the company had a contest in the cafeteria to see who could eat the most oatmeal cookies in a minute. We had a large glass of milk to wash them down. I ate about seven and came in second.

She grew up in evangelical churches in Colorado and Virginia and graduated from Liberty University before entering Dallas Theological Seminary last year to prepare for a career in the church. But lately she has been frustrated by evangelicals’ failure to challenge the prejudice and predation in their midst. Over the course of the week, as Roy Moore, the Republican senatorial candidate in Alabama, faced more allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with young women and teenagers, many evangelicals leapt to his defense. To Ms. Schiess, this is one more sign that a new ritual has superseded Sunday worship and weeknight Bible studies: a profane devotional practice, with immense power to shape evangelicals’ beliefs. This \"liturgy\" is the nightly consumption of conservative cable news. Liberals love to complain about conservatives’ steady diet of misinformation through partisan media, but Ms. Schiess’s complaint is more profound: Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson aren’t just purveyors of distorted news, but high priests of a false religion. \"The reason Fox News is so formative is that it’s this repetitive, almost ritualistic thing that people do every night,\" Ms. Schiess told me. \"It forms in them particular fears and desires, an idea of America. This is convincing on a less than logical level, and the church is not communicating to them in that same way.\" It’s no secret that humans — religious and secular alike — often act on \"less than logical\" impulses. Social scientists have documented our tendency to reject reliable evidence if it challenges our beliefs. Hours of tearful victims’ testimony will not deter evangelicals who see Roy Moore as the latest Christian martyr persecuted by the liberal establishment. \"Their loyalties are much more strongly formed by conservative media than their churches,\" Ms. Schiess said. \"That’s the challenge for church leaders today, I think — rediscovering rather ancient ideas about how to form our ultimate loyalty to God and his kingdom.\" When I sought out conservative and progressive critics of white evangelical politics and asked them how to best understand it, this was their answer: pay attention to worship, both inside and outside of church, because the church is not doing its job. Humans thrive on ritual and collective acts of devotion. And the way we worship has political consequences. It shapes our response to evil and our reaction to people different from ourselves. Some evangelicals have grown so frustrated with their tradition’s captivity to a particular brand of politics — and the idolatries of white supremacy and the free market — that they have proposed a radical withdrawal from both Moral Majority-style activism and modern consumer culture. Worship, after all, is not just something that happens in church. The philosopher James K. A. Smith, who teaches at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., has argued that our lives are shot through with unconscious acts of worship, whether we genuflect at the Apple Store or wake up whispering prayers for our child’s admission to the Ivy League. \"We are, ultimately, liturgical animals because we are fundamentally desiring creatures,\" he writes in his book \"Desiring the Kingdom.\" \"We are what we love.\" In that case, rooting out idolatries means radical lifestyle change. Some disillusioned conservatives have embraced what the Christian writer Rod Dreher calls the \"Benedict Option\": a retreat from the world to preserve the values of Christian civilization during these new Dark Ages, in the spirit of St. Benedict. He argues that Christians should stop trying to \"make America great again,\" abandon the ends-justify-the-means politics that leads them to defend predators and scoundrels like Mr. Moore, and focus instead on nurturing local Christian community. \"Hostile secular nihilism has won the day in our nation’s government, and the culture has turned powerfully against traditional Christians,\" Mr. Dreher writes in \"The Benedict Option.\" This kind of intense localism may lead one to befriend unfamiliar neighbors, and hospitality is a major theme of Mr. Dreher’s book. But at a time when many Americans live in economically and ethnically segregated communities, it seems doubtful that further withdrawal from the world will stimulate radical empathy. The urge to batten down the hatches may actually feed the cultural patterns that enabled the election of Donald Trump: the impulse to associate only with people like ourselves and grow even more certain that evil forces are persecuting us. Luma Simms likes to say that she tried the Benedict Option before it was trendy. She emigrated to California from Iraq as a young girl. Her father was Syrian Orthodox, her mother a Chaldean Catholic, but the desire to assimilate drove her to convert to evangelical Protestantism. \"When I asked myself, what does it mean to become American, part of the answer was espousing an evangelical Protestant worldview,\" she told me. \"I wanted to be on the political side that believed America was good.\" After Ms. Simms became a parent, she began to worry about the influence of secular culture on her children as well as the politicization of mainstream evangelicalism. In 2006 her family moved to Arizona to join an insular church that promoted home schooling and strict patriarchal authority. \"We were protecting our children, raising them up to be stronger citizens of a rightly understood America, so that when American culture starts collapsing like Dreher keeps telling us it will, they would rise up, having been well disciplined and educated, to become leaders,\" she said. The community was so cloistered and dogmatic that it estranged her from her oldest daughter and pushed her to cut off contact with her own parents. The church \"made families like us view almost everyone outside that circle as a potential enemy of our thoughts,\" Ms. Simms told me. After a dispute over the pastor’s authority, the church disintegrated in 2010. Even mainstream churches can inadvertently encourage this kind of cultural quarantine: Most Americans still bow their heads in congregations dominated by a single racial or ethnic group. Although the diversity of congregations is growing nationwide, eight in 10 Americans still attend a house of worship in which one ethnic group makes up at least 80 percent of the congregation, according to the most recent National Congregations Study. Reformers have long been working to build multiracial bridges in Christian academia and media, but these efforts alone won’t desegregate religious fellowship. Ekemini Uwan is a Nigerian-American who has ventured farther than most black Christians into the citadels of white evangelicalism. Last year she graduated from Westminster Theological Seminary in Glenside, Pa. For most of her time there, she was the only black woman in her program, she told me (the school has a sizable Asian student population, but fewer than 6 percent of students identify as black or Latino). She writes for traditionally white evangelical media, like Christianity Today magazine. But she has continued to attend \"a predominantly black church\" in Philadelphia, she said. Ms. Uwan is used to keeping her guard up in scholarship and journalism, but worship is different: It requires the freedom to be vulnerable. \"There’s what we theologians call an eschatological intrusion. It’s a foretaste of what we’re going to experience with God around the throne in the new heavens and new earth. It gets us out of our own world for an hour or two. You’re lost in worship, in wonder.\" In a largely white worship setting, \"when you have to prove yourself all the time, when your orthodoxy is always in question due to your blackness, you’re not safe to be vulnerable and honest,\" she said. When the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. observed that 11 o’clock on a Sunday morning is the most segregated hour in America, he was acknowledging the special power that ritual and community have to stoke or weaken both love and hatred. There is no substitute for sharing the bread and wine — the climax of the Christian liturgy — with people unlike yourself, Ms. Schiess said. She called for fighting false idols with right worship: \"Fox News forms a fear, a caricature of other people; if communion were done in churches with diverse populations, it would counteract that fear.\" A new theology of communion appealed to Ms. Simms, the Christian in Arizona. A few years ago she converted to Catholicism, moved by its balance of otherworldliness and earthly compassion: \"The sacraments elevate us,\" she said. For Catholics, the bread and wine are not metaphors for Jesus’ body and blood, but the real thing — a miraculous, fleshly conduit between God and creation. The Vatican has stressed the doctrine of the \"mystical body of Christ\" — which includes, at least potentially, all human beings — in response to racism, genocide and other atrocities of the 20th century. Catholic theology is not inherently more moral than Protestantism, and the sacraments have not saved the Catholic Church from its share of hypocrisy and crime over the centuries. But for some evangelicals, a stronger sense of participation in holy mystery offers a metaphysical jolt to the system — at a time when the relationship between evangelical worship and politics seems broken. Richard Rohr, a Franciscan friar and prolific author who runs the Center for Action and Contemplation in Albuquerque, was surprised when his publisher told him that his books on Christian contemplation and the power of liturgy are most popular with young evangelical men — who see a direct connection between changing worship and changing politics. \"So many of the millennial evangelicals I work with, they’re so disillusioned with their good parents’ inability to deal with racism, sexism and homophobia — the issues tearing our country apart,\" he told me. Other young Christians are pursuing new forms of worship outside of traditional churches altogether. If you’re wondering what the future of not-so-organized religion looks like, look to the community that has grown up around \"The Liturgists,\" a podcast hosted by Michael Gungor, a musician, and Mike McHargue, a science writer (both are former evangelicals). When they began the podcast in 2014, \"we started it out of a sense of existential loneliness,\" Mr. Gungor told me. They broadcast liturgical music, meditations and interviews with theologians and activists. The podcast has nurtured a community with a life of its own. Listeners find one another through social media, and the co-hosts travel the country to convene events where fans eat, drink and worship together — groups that often continue meeting after Mr. Gungor and Mr. McHargue leave town. \"As America deinstitutionalizes and moves away from religion, people — especially millennials — have lost something. Their community becomes primarily virtual, they’re seeing people through a screen and not flesh and blood, and there’s great data that this leads them to loneliness and depression,\" Mr. McHargue said. \"The core of every podcast is, ‘you’re not alone,’ and that draws people in, but we can’t stay there. We have to draw them into some kind of communal practice.\" One to two million listeners download the podcast each month, and it is surely one of the most theologically diverse subcultures on the internet. The audience includes atheists, evangelicals, mainline liberal Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox Christians, all seeking new spiritual community. All these people have one thing in common: the instinct that worship should be an act of humility, not hubris. It should be a discomfiting experience, not a doubling down on what’s easy and familiar. The battle for the soul of evangelicalism, the struggle to disentangle it from white supremacy, from misogyny — and from the instinct to defend politicians like Roy Moore — demands sound arguments grounded in evidence. But the effort must also advance at the precognitive level, in the habits and relationships of worshiping communities. Fellowship has the power to refashion angry gut feelings and instead form meek hearts and bounden duty.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/opinion/sunday/escape-roy-moores-evangelicalism.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Their Pledges Die. So Should Fraternities.', 'text': ' Following a night of heavy drinking at a fraternity at Texas State University, a 20-year-old was found dead. Another 20-year-old died at Florida State University in nearly identical circumstances. At Penn State University, the victim was 19. Security cameras and text messages documented the fumbling attempts by fraternity members to revive him and then to cover up the link between his unconscious condition and the 18 or so drinks that they forced on him in a roughly 90-minute span. As he moaned and thrashed and blood from a lacerated spleen filled his abdomen, they waited about 12 hours to summon medical help, by which point it was too late. At Louisiana State University, the victim was 18, with a blood alcohol content of .496 percent. That’s more than six times the legal limit for driving and about two and a half times the amount of alcohol that can cause someone to black out. All of these incidents occurred this year — the Texas and Florida ones in the last two weeks — and yet 2017 isn’t some nadir. At least six young men died in connection with fraternity hazing rituals in 2014, according to Hank Nuwer’s Hazing Clearinghouse, a website with a ghastly, heartbreaking tally. Two years before that, seven died. Across decades, the toll of deaths related to fraternity revelry and recklessness is surely in the hundreds. And while physical stress plays a role in some fatalities, most reflect the kind of extreme drinking that’s in the DNA of so-called Greek life. Do we need any cause beyond all of that dying to do away with fraternities wherever possible and to diminish their prominence at schools where various circumstances, including the housing that fraternities provide, prevent them from being shuttered? I don’t think so, but there are additional reasons nonetheless. On a range of fronts, fraternities — and sororities — contradict our stated values and undercut our supposed goals for higher education, putting our inconsistencies and hypocrisies under a magnifying glass. And the recent attention to scattered schools that have eradicated or curtailed Greek life has been misleading. Against all wisdom, fraternities thrive; in the new book \"True Gentlemen: The Broken Pledge of America’s Fraternities,\" John Hechinger estimates that at least 380,000 male undergraduates belong to Greek organizations, which he says represents a 50 percent increase over the last decade. \"I think they’re more popular than ever,\" he told me recently. He doesn’t call for outlawing them, partly because he doesn’t consider that feasible, given First Amendment freedom-of-assembly protections. But he hardly considers Greek life ideal. \"If we could create higher education from scratch, would we have organizations that divide people by race, class and gender at institutions that are supposed to be encouraging diversity?\" he asked. His answer was immediate and emphatic: \"No.\" Obviously, that’s not all that fraternities and sororities do. Many are vigorously engaged in charitable work and community service. They provide a social mooring that students find helpful. There’s some evidence that students in fraternities maintain higher-than-average grades, and the Gallup-Purdue Index, a far-reaching survey of American college graduates, found that those who belonged to fraternities and sororities reported more career and life satisfaction later on than those who didn’t.   But, as Hechinger noted, fraternities segregate. They discriminate. They concentrate and enshrine privilege at a time when we’re ostensibly trying to be more mindful of that. In so doing they reveal the hollowness of many of our vows. We profess outrage about sexual assault and abuse, the dimensions of which have been rendered even clearer by the galling revelations of the last month and a half. Still we indulge fraternities, which abet that behavior. Persuasive research — along with common sense — tells us that members of all-male fraternities are more likely to have a warped view of permissible sexual contact and that women who frequent fraternity parties are more likely to be assaulted. Additionally, the binge drinking so prevalent at fraternities is the enemy of informed consent. \"We need to be cautious about broad-brush generalizations,\" Alexander McCormick, an Indiana University professor who is the director of the National Survey of Student Engagement, said to me in an email. But, he conceded, some fraternities are guilty of \"encouraging and rewarding sexual conquest that condones or normalizes sexual assault.\" We profess alarm over how partisan American politics is, how fractured our culture has become, and how viciously tribal our interactions can be. In light of that, we resolve to assemble more heterogeneous campuses. But then we blithely watch and even celebrate the retreat of students into fraternities and sororities, which are in many cases largely homogeneous enclaves antithetical to the broadening of perspective and challenging of ingrained assumptions that higher education should be all about. We say that we’ll press fraternities to be responsible, and they in turn promise to obey. But there’s spotty follow-through. Penn State in 2004 trumpeted a program called Greek Pride: A Return to Glory. Beta Theta Pi, where the pledge with the lacerated spleen languished, was described as a model fraternity at the school, with strict rules governing alcohol consumption. I’m sure that’s enormous consolation to the grieving parents of that pledge, Timothy Piazza. \"These fraternities have drink, danger and debauchery in their blood — right alongside secrecy and self-protection,\" Lisa Wade, an Occidental College sociology professor and the author of \"American Hookup: The New Culture of Sex on Campus,\" wrote in a Time magazine essay that called for an end to fraternities. \"They cannot reform.\" Shy of abolishing them, colleges could at least stop promoting and even romanticizing them. Hechinger said that campus websites and tours have presented gauzy propaganda extolling Greek life. Why not provide detailed information about individual fraternities’ disciplinary records instead? And why not put more energy into nurturing other groups and living arrangements that might siphon students away from fraternities? Wade began her Time essay by observing that 150 years ago, fraternities were regarded with enormous suspicion by many college presidents, who described them as \"un-American,\" a \"plague\" and a force for \"greater unkindness and ill feeling than almost anything else in college.\" And college presidents today? When I spoke with Wade, she told me that they might not be champions of fraternities if they weren’t already stuck with them. \"Imagine a world,\" she said, \"in which everything was the same about higher education except there have never been Greek organizations. An 18-year-old waltzes into a dean’s office and says, ‘I want to start an exclusive club on campus that doesn’t allow women and serves mostly white and privileged students and we’re going to throw parties all the time that are illegal, and at these parties, all the bad stuff that happens on campus is going to happen disproportionately. What do you think?’ \" Wade’s hypothetical 18-year-old leaves out the part where undertakers cart the casualties away. Even so I think the dean turns his proposal down.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/opinion/pledges-fraternities-violence-deaths.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '', 'text': '', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/sunday-review/bernie-bernstein-fake-jews.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The G.O.P. Is Fooling Itself on Taxes', 'text': ' The Republican Party seems to have backed itself into a corner on tax policy. After the failure of their health care plan, President Trump and congressional leaders have understandably decided that they need a win. If they somehow fail to pass a tax cut, they will anger their base and their donors and look incompetent to swing voters. But the actual bill that the House passed last week — and the modestly different plan the Senate is considering — is a dreadful piece of policy. It would cause the deficit to soar and, as a result, probably reduce economic growth. It would also raise taxes for millions of middle-class families. And most Americans realize that the tax plan is dreadful. Only 16 percent of adults said they thought the plan would reduce their own taxes, according to a Quinnipiac poll released last week. On the same day the poll came out, several Republican senators criticized the plan, which suggests it may be in jeopardy. There is no easy way out for the party at this point. In coming days, Senate leaders will probably claim to take steps to fix the House bill’s flaws. But they won’t be able to, absent a complete rewriting. The core of the plan is the problem. How did Republicans do this to themselves? Above all, they refused to heed the lessons of 2016 — of Trump’s shocking romp through the primaries and even more shocking general-election win. In a time of deep economic dissatisfaction, among members of both parties, Republican leaders insisted on basing their plan around an enormous tax cut for the wealthy. Doing so pleased their donors and trickle-down true believers, but it is worth pausing for a moment on the cynicism of the plan. In substance, it is almost the direct opposite of the party’s middle-class rhetoric. \"The G.O.P.,\" Henry Olsen, a conservative policy expert, recently said, \"really wants to do nothing other than cut taxes for businesspeople and the top bracket based on what can only be called religious devotion to supply-side theory.\" Once Republican leaders filled their plan with tax cuts for the wealthy, they didn’t have much money left for the middle class. In the Senate, Republicans were so desperate to find money that this past week they released a new version of the bill that made virtually all of the middle-class tax cuts temporary. They expire before the bill’s final year, 2027. An assortment of middle-class tax increases — again, to help cover the cost of the tax cuts for the wealthy — last for the full life of the Senate bill. As a result, it ends up being a tax increase on households making less than $75,000, according to the only rigorous analysis so far, by the Senate’s Joint Committee on Taxation. For families making somewhat more than $75,000, the tax cut is modest and likely temporary, given the deficit. The plan, says Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, a highly regarded research group, has \"stunningly meager tax benefits for middle class.\" The best hope for stopping the bill is the handful of Republicans willing to think beyond raw partisanship. They include Susan Collins and John McCain, who helped defeat the health bill, and Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, who aren’t running for re-election and consider themselves fiscal conservatives. (Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin, has come out against the bill, although he did the same on the health care bill, before flip-flopping.) True, another failed attempt at major legislation would be a big political problem for the Republicans. But passing a hastily written, deficit-busting bill that harms the middle class would not be great, either. It’s impossible for these senators to solve their party’s political troubles. They may as well do the right thing.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/republicans-taxes-middle-class.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Anthony Doerr: We Were Warned', 'text': ' Boise, Idaho — Twenty-five years ago this month, more than 1,500 prominent scientists, including over half of the living Nobel laureates, issued a manifesto titled \"World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity\" in which they admonished, \"A great change in our stewardship of the earth and the life on it is required if vast human misery is to be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievably mutilated.\" They cited stresses on the planet’s atmosphere, forests, oceans and soils, and called on everybody to act decisively. \"No more than one or a few decades remain,\" the scientists wrote, \"before the chance to avert the threats we now confront will be lost.\" I was 19 years old when their warning was published and though I understood, in a teenager-y, \"Rainforest Rap\" sort of way, that humans were messing with the planet, the document freaked me out. It was so urgent, so dire. E. O. Wilson had signed it. Carl Sagan had signed it! So did I act immediately and decisively? Um, I did not. In the ensuing years I wrote checks to some conservation organizations, replaced some incandescent bulbs and rode my bike to work. I hammered together a composting bin that promptly fell apart. I gave a self-important lecture to a neighbor on the importance of using his recycling can. I also hurtled through the troposphere on hundreds of airplanes (each round trip from New York to London costs the Arctic another three square meters of ice), bought and sold multiple automobiles and helped my wife put two more Americans onto the planet. Our air-conditioning compressor is at least a decade old, my truck averages 15 miles to the gallon and I routinely walk up to a podium, open a brand new plastic bottle of water, take a sip and promptly forget that it exists. Sometimes I wake at 2 a.m. worrying that my great-granddaughter will have to march through her distant, broiling future gathering all the plastic I ever disposed of. \"You mean he knew,\" she’ll ask her mom, as she pulls the plastic clamshell I ate a Chinese chicken salad out of back in November 2017, \"and he still did this?\" \"I told you,\" her mother will say. \"He was the absolute worst.\" This autumn, as smoke from dozens of wildfires made the air outside our windows in Boise, Idaho, about as healthy as a casino smoking lounge, as Harvey flooded parts of Texas and Maria smashed Puerto Rico, as 210,000 gallons of oil leaked from the Keystone Pipeline in South Dakota, I was tempted to imagine our president cruising in his jumbo jet above the various cataclysms with some coal-friendly legislation in his lap and his fingers in his ears. This is a man, after all, who in a single month in 2007 poured two million gallons of fresh water through the lawns, pool and 22 bathrooms of his Palm Beach, Fla., residence. But sometimes making villains out of other people can distract us from our own complicities. If Donald Trump were never elected, Harvey still would have flooded Houston, October still would have been the 394th consecutive month that global average temperatures were above the 20th century average, and Delhi would still be choking on air so foul that just breathing for a day is roughly equivalent to smoking 44 cigarettes. In a season when the silencing of voices is so rightfully in the public discussion, maybe the 25th anniversary of the \"Scientists’ Warning\" offers an opportunity to reflect on just how well each of us is listening to the voices we don’t want to hear. Here’s what I think happens with me. Maybe I wake up, turn on my phone, read something like, \"On average, populations of vertebrate species declined by 58 percent between 1970 and 2012,\" and I feel queasy — as though I’m living in a world that’s a shadow of the world I was born into — and at the same time I probably also get a little less sensitive to the insanity of our trajectory, and then I put down my phone and get swamped by the tsunami of the day: One kid has strep throat, another needs to go to the dentist, I’ve forgotten six or seven internet passwords, the dog just pooped on the rug. Hour by hour, minute by minute, I make decisions that seem like the right things to do at the time, but which prevent me from reflecting on the most significant, most critical fact in my life: Every day I participate in a system that is weaponizing our big, gorgeous planet against our kids. \"Death,\" Zadie Smith wrote in 2013, \"is what happens to everyone else … If I truly believed that being a corpse was not only a possible future but my only guaranteed future — I’d do all kinds of things differently.\" If our biological imperative is to pass our genes to the next generation, our moral imperative has to be to try, before we become corpses, to leave them a planet they can survive on. Since the \"World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity,\" humans have done extraordinary things. We stabilized the stratospheric ozone layer; we connected people in instantaneous and previously unimaginable ways; we landed a golf cart on Mars and drove it around. We even got every nation-state on earth (except ours, apparently) to agree to try to achieve net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by midcentury. But we’ve also removed enough forests to cover Texas nearly twice, pumped almost half of the carbon emitted in human history into the atmosphere, grown the population by over two billion and cut the number of wild animals on earth by something close to half. This month a new coalition of scientists, led by researchers at Oregon State University, published a new warning: \"World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice.\" It’s not as poetic as the first, unfortunately, but it’s just as grim. \"Soon,\" they write, \"it will be too late to shift course away from our failing trajectory, and time is running out.\" Over 15,000 scientists have signed the new call to action; according to the Alliance of World Scientists, that’s the most people to ever co-sign and formally support a published journal article. For decades science has been warning us that we are compromising earth’s systems, and that none of us will be immune to the consequences. Everywhere you look, people are trying: adopting renewable energy, working to guarantee women control over their reproductive decisions, fighting food waste, shifting to plant-based diets. Maybe the most important thing the rest of us can do is take our fingers out of our ears and join them.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/anthony-doerr-we-were-warned.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Nuclear War Doesn’t Seem So Funny After All', 'text': ' In January, I started writing a novel in which a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb was detonated in the center of Washington, where I live. It was meant to be funny. I had read a 2011 report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that described the effect of such a detonation, and was surprised to learn that my apartment in Adams Morgan would most likely survive the initial blast. I imagined myself and my neighbors — about half wealthy millennials and half older people who’d bought in before the neighborhood’s property values skyrocketed — sheltering in awkward place in a basement, bickering over scraps of food and someone’s private stash of LaCroix cans. Then, in April, Kim Jong-un of North Korea released a propaganda video of his army striking the Capitol; over the summer he tested intercontinental ballistic missiles that may be capable of striking the East Coast. More recently, President Trump called Mr. Kim \"short and fat,\" and now, apparently, North Korea has sentenced Mr. Trump to death in absentia. Suddenly, my novel started feeling a lot less funny. For 1980s babies like me, nuclear war has long had a darkly comic edge. Too young to have experienced 1950s school drills or to remember the heightened anxieties of the early 1980s, we’ve viewed nuclear war as a terrifying improbability, especially compared with the terrifying certainties that we know all too well: global warming, terrorism, lone-wolf gunmen. America is in the privileged position of having inflicted nuclear casualties, not suffered them — and since the Cold War ended, it’s felt relatively likely that we wouldn’t be on either side of that equation again. Understanding nuclear war from movies, books and grainy videos of kids hiding ineffectually under desks, we’ve seen it mostly through two prisms: black humor and camp. On the camp side, there’s the 1983 movie \"The Day After,\" with an Urkel-jeaned Steve Guttenberg and all the flashing skeletons. On the black humor side, everything from \"Dr. Strangelove\" to Kurt Vonnegut to the work of Takashi Murakami, as Spencer Weart points out in his book \"The Rise of Nuclear Fear.\" Humor requires distance — we’ve been living in a constantly refreshed state of \"too soon\" for jokes about school shooters ever since I graduated from high school, two months after the Columbine attack. The psychologists Peter McGraw and Caleb Warren have developed a framework called \"benign violation theory\" to describe events that lend themselves best to humor: a violation or a threat, but one from which the joker is somewhat removed. It’s unclear exactly how much distance we need to laugh about something as cataclysmic as nuclear attack. Spencer Weart believes that the black humor of the ’60s was actually occasioned by proximity — a nervous proximity that forced nervous laughter. While \"nobody was making jokes during the Cuban missile crisis,\" Dr. Weart said, writers and artists in the years after used morbid satire to express their inexpressible panic. \"Thoughts of nuclear war were repressed because they were so terrible, and it came out in humor,\" he told me. Since the end of the Cold War, he points out, the instinct to humorize nuclear war has diminished along with the threat. More recent dystopian and nuclear fiction, from \"The Hunger Games\" to Cormac McCarthy’s \"The Road\" to \"Mad Max: Fury Road,\" have mostly been intensely serious. (There are exceptions: the running gags on \"South Park\" about Korean leaders with terrible haircuts, for instance.) Although \"Saturday Night Live\" and other late-night shows still mock Kim Jong-un (\"the Harry Styles of North Korea,\" as the Weekend Update host Colin Jost called him in April), there hasn’t been the flowering of gallows humor that we saw during the early days of the Cold War. Dr. Weart believes that the relative lack of specific threat over the past decade has encouraged a more serious approach: \"You don’t have the visceral terror and therefore, you don’t have that reaction of laughing.\" This theory is borne out by the response of a nation that earns its visceral terror far more than anyone in America: South Korea. According to Haeryun Kang, a South Korean journalist, South Koreans tend to be somewhat blasé about the threats from their northern neighbor, either because of denial or sheer habituation. But they also have a \"vibrant culture\" of joking about it, creating meme-like \"parody posters\" showing, for instance, Kim Jong-un on a barbecue. \"Laughing about something is one of the more accessible ways to approach a difficult issue,\" Ms. Kang said by email. For me, an increase in visceral terror over the past year at first made me need to laugh, and then made laughing feel inappropriate. When I started my nuclear-attack novel, I felt I was using humor to assuage my latent fears of an attack; it felt cathartic. But catharsis, like humor, implies a remove: You’re re-experiencing a past trauma, or inhabiting someone else’s. As it became increasingly plausible that I could live through the precise situation I was describing, the humor faded, and I abandoned the project. Should we actually approach the brink of nuclear war, humor might feel necessary again. And if it does, I have a novel all ready to go.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/nuclear-war-not-funny.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'God Is in the Salad Dressing', 'text': ' Not long ago, I visited friends in rural Virginia. I cherish them because we have little in common other than our like-mindedness. Susan, a historian, is 11 years older than I am and has four children to my zero. I grew up among atheist Soviet Jews; she among evangelical Christians. Susan was home-schooled and married Pete, a pastor. I’ve remained unmarried for so long even my mother has surrendered. The family lives in Christ — if my visit overlaps with a Sunday, I join the congregation Pete ministers to in the church on the family property, an old-school Virginia holding of corn, cotton and soybeans, with lots reserved for the family farm, a small publishing house and a bed-and-breakfast. I love Pete and Susan because they’re spiritual and religious in the way few people seem to be, in my religion and theirs. For them, faith is an experience of learning, welcome and community, with inquiry and debate in lieu of dogma, exclusion and enforcement. They make no big deal of the visiting Jew in the pews. For me, sitting through a sermon on the Book of Revelation still feels strange, but talking afterward — about whether Christianity approves of tough love (yes, in the Prophetic tradition) and why Susan bakes five loaves of buttermilk bread on the Sundays communion is offered (Christ broke bread, not wafers) — feels like home. Their congregation is as small as you’d expect it to be. My most recent visit, however, tested the connection between us. Entering the house one afternoon, I could tell something was wrong. Pete was cleaning in a way that didn’t seem to be about cleaning. Susan, who generally gets up at 5 a.m. and by late morning has done what most of us have done in a day, looked through me and said, \"I need to sit down and watch a rerun of something.\" She did, eventually, explain that the night before, they’d received unwelcome news about one of their children. I waited for her to continue, but that’s all she said. I’m from a family whose boundaries were so faint that my mother used to scroll through the photos on my phone \"just to see what you’ve been up to.\" And so my first impulse was to blurt out, \"What happened?\" I caught myself just in time. Susan and Pete had always been very open with me. There was a reason they didn’t want to do the same now, and just then, not asking — making peace with not knowing — seemed like the more loving act than scratching for a way in. But I didn’t want to utter a platitude and tiptoe out. That felt wrong, too. So I said the only other thing I could think of: \"Can I make lunch?\" Susan, who does all the family cooking, sighed. \"I’ve been meaning to make a big salad for weeks,\" she said. Settled, then. Their youngest, who still lives at home, wanted nothing to do with a salad, so Susan said she would make her a grilled cheese. For the next 15 minutes, a house that is never at rest — four animals around us, 50 horses, sheep, goats and ducks outside — fell silent. Pete, lost in thought, made snacks for his wife to eat later while she watched TV; Susan, lost in thought, made lunch for her daughter; and I, lost in my task, made salad for Susan: salad mix, broccoli, cauliflower, sweet peppers, brussels sprouts, radishes, carrots and feta. The only sound was my peeling, chopping and scraping and a kitchen at work: the oven exhaling; a pan emerging to rest on the grills of the burners; the scrape of a spatula. The three of us entered the most beautiful silence — composed, rhythmic and filled with a kind of grace, perhaps because Susan was grateful to have food made for her, and I grateful to be something other than a nuisance. Where just minutes before I’d felt only awkwardness, now I felt something approaching elation. If I were a believer, I would have said God was there. When the salad was ready, Susan embraced me. And what was an opportunity for an unforeseen boundary turned into a moment of greater intimacy than before. Susan and Pete might have called it fellowship. The power of food — of cooking, of cooking together — is its ability to briefly blot out almost any pain. It is as elemental as pain itself — from nothing you make something that will sustain you, and people you love, into tomorrow. It will last only till then, but tomorrow, you can do it again. One of the things I love about the family’s church is that it encourages you to experience God on your own terms; food, then, is my faith. The experience of making it, serving it and eating it can be sacred. There aren’t many things in this world immune from ill will — for me, a \"well-covered\" table, as we say it in Russian, is one of them. This Thanksgiving, as my family celebrates the 29th anniversary of our arrival in this country — a deep Reagan-Bush time that now seems like a liberal’s fantasy of conservatism — my father will trot out the dishes that make the conflicts in my family go still for several hours as our eyes roll ecstatically back in our heads. America has not always felt like home, but it ails so badly now that I don’t feel the luxury of the casual alienation that is the gift of sweeter times. And so I pray, in my secular way, that across a million kitchens where our divided people gather this Thanksgiving, instead of saying what won’t help anyone by being said, someone in charge of a kitchen-sink salad asks someone from the other side to help her figure out the dressing. I used olive oil, honey-mustard dressing, lime juice, crushed red pepper flakes and oregano — the best of what there was at hand.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/opinion/sunday/cooking-religion-faith.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Thanksgiving Nutrition Tips: Eat Whatever You Want, but Not That', 'text': ' It’s Thanksgiving — a time for family, gratitude and historical revision of an indigenous genocide. Unfortunately for many Americans, Thanksgiving has become a time for overeating, followed by weight gain and inevitable self-loathing. But there’s an easy way to break the natural cycle of holiday contempt for yourself. And don’t worry. It’s not body positivity or detangling your worth from calorie intake — it’s something that’s actually possible! I’m talking about intuitive eating. You probably know this diet method from those fitness Instagram accounts you follow that make you sad about your thigh girth. It’s a simple way to manage your food intake and be deserving of kindness and respect from others — and eventually even yourself. Maybe. With intuitive eating, there are no restrictions and no limitations. Instead of focusing on the forbidden, this food system celebrates all the delish nutrients your body naturally needs, like phosphorus, chromium and folic acid. Yum! The best part? This revolutionary nutrition concept has only one rule: Eat what you want when you’re hungry and don’t eat when you’re not hungry. Piece of cake, right? (If you’re hungry for cake, that is.) To make sure you totally understand this straightforward food lifestyle in time for Thanksgiving, here are a few easy sub-rules that’ll help you apply that one super basic rule, which is so simple, it barely needs sub-rules! Listen to you Stop calorie counting. Just learn how to eat! You’re probably thinking: \"But I know how to eat. That’s my problem!\" No. 1, there are no problems with your body, only opportunities. Major opportunities. And No. 2, no, you don’t! You’re eating with your brain now. Well, with your mouth. But, your brain’s at the wheel. Instead, picture your appetite as a driverless car, but the driverless driver is your stomach. Don’t think about what you want to eat. Feel what you need to eat. Then enjoy whatever your stomach cues you to eat, as long as you’re sure it’s not what your brain’s telling you to eat. And that’s really it! Listen to your body — but not the brain part of your body, the rest of it — and you’ll have a healthful holiday. Know true hunger Before you take a bite of Thanksgiving dinner, ask yourself, \"Why am I eating?\" Is it because your stomach’s growling or because it’s \"time\" to eat? Is it because you feel hunger pangs or because refusing to eat Thanksgiving dinner would be \"weird\"? Is it because you have blurred vision from low blood sugar or because if you don’t eat, your mother will think no one likes her cooking, lock herself in the basement half-bath, and insist your Step-Aunt Brenda host next year? If your reasons for eating are anything aside from the early stages of malnutrition, put down your fork and wait until you’re truly grateful for even a small bite of food. That is the spirit of the holiday, after all. Stop with labels Forget \"good\" foods and \"bad\" foods. There’s only food your body wants and food it doesn’t. Some days, your body wants a kale salad. On Thanksgiving, your body might want pumpkin cheesecake. Both are 100 percent fine as long as you’re listening to your body’s needs and exclusively choosing food that’s labeled whole, organic and no sugar added, which pumpkin cheesecake would never be. So, bad example. If you find yourself craving that pumpkin cheesecake, which I accidentally said was fine before, step away from the table, head into the kitchen and whip up something your body actually wants — like a yummy bowl of brown rice. Garnish with a small sprinkle of cinnamon and voilà! But remember, portion control! Focus on food We all multitask when we eat, especially at the holidays. Those non-meal distractions make it hard to register our body’s cues of fullness. Don’t mindlessly graze as you tablescape or scarf down your dinner while explaining to friends and family why your boyfriend of three years refused to come home with you. Make food your singular focus while eating. Of course, there will be conversations at the Thanksgiving table. And that’s completely O.K. — as long as you stay out of them. Don’t speak and try not to listen. Earplugs are a good idea or, if you can, simply avoid all noise. Light is also hugely distracting. Think about a blindfold. The easiest way to dodge all the commotion is to take your plate away from the crowd entirely. Sneak into the basement half-bath after your mother uses it as a meltdown closet. Turn the lights off, lock the door and relish your dinner alone on the toilet.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/thanksgiving-nutrition-tips.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'America’s Statue Wars Are a Family Feud', 'text': ' Bozeman, Mont. — Just as citizens suspected of conspiring with foreign governments should be investigated and prosecuted in the present, those who committed treason in the past need not be glorified. What could be more logical than taxpayers’ patriotic plea that their federal, state and municipal governments consider removing, from public property, tributes to traitors loyal to the Confederate States of America who took up arms against the United States to perpetuate the institution of slavery? I have no qualms about tearing down bronze Confederates on government land. And I descend from one of those men. My paternal great-great-grandfather Stephen Nila Carlile served as a private in the Confederate States Army. His regiment, the First Cherokee Mounted Rifles, was formed in 1861 when the Cherokee Nation, residing in Indian Territory (in what is now eastern Oklahoma), signed a treaty of alliance with the Confederacy. The Cherokee had an understandable grudge against the United States government for removing them to the West in the 1830s. And before that, as one of the so-called Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast, they had been pressured to cede their hunting lands and trade in their traditional matrilineal system for Christianity, male dominance and commercial agriculture as practiced in the 19th-century South. Which is to say, they owned slaves. So when they traipsed the Trail of Tears, their slaves marched with them. As far as I know, Private Carlile, an illiterate, did not own slaves. But he would marry into a fancier Cherokee family that did. His future brother-in-law Pleasant Napoleon Blackstone fought for the Confederates in the Battle of Honey Springs in 1863. It was the largest battle fought in Indian Territory. White soldiers made up a minority of combatants. Cherokee, Creek and Choctaw Confederates fought a Union coalition of the Indian Home Guard (including Delaware, Seneca and Shawnee, plus some rogue pro-Lincoln Cherokees) as well as the First Kansas Colored Infantry, one of the first black units in the war to engage in combat. Uncle Pleasant was wounded but commended for killing one of these heroes. The family scuttlebutt is that Private Carlile shuttled messages between Cherokee Confederates and their Choctaw allies. After the war, by the way, a freed slave once owned by Indian Territory Choctaws probably composed the spiritual \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" — a piece of trivia that pretty much sums up American history: hideous memories and beautiful songs. I have fantasized about sawing the Confederates off my family tree, thereby whittling the branches down to Swedish Baptists who would frown upon my godless, low-key life. But it’s worth noting that my Confederate relatives were not American traitors. They were volunteers from another sovereign state. Meanwhile, the Cherokee Nation has also been debating whether to remove two Confederate monuments on the grounds of the Cherokee Courthouse in the nation’s capital of Tahlequah, including a tribute to Private Carlile’s commander, Gen. Stand Watie. In October, the Cherokee Courthouse was the rallying point for a march to observe Indigenous Peoples’ Day, meant to replace Columbus Day’s celebration of conquest with appreciation for the Americas’ original inhabitants. Standing in front of the courthouse, Candessa Tehee, a professor at Northeastern State University, told The Cherokee Phoenix, \"To celebrate Columbus is to celebrate an individual who is one of the first documented slave traders of North America.\" She is correct, but it is not boring that she said this while standing on the same lawn as the monuments to Cherokee Confederates. Let’s stop and indulge in a moment of nostalgia for the good old days of, oh, six months ago when the question was whether to dismantle taxpayer-maintained statues of traitors like Robert E. Lee — and the answer was clear to every citizen and elected official mature enough to accept a female Doctor Who. All subsequent arguments on which monuments to heave into the landfill of history are going to be murkier and will surely lay bare what an exasperating country General Lee failed to destroy. Take Christopher Columbus. Announcing a task force to review New York City monuments \"that in any way may suggest hate or division or racism,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio described the honoree of Columbus Circle as \"complicated, to say the least.\" Yet I wonder how many of the nation’s many Columbus memorials were truly built as tributes to a navigationally challenged slavemonger. How many were instead put up by Italian-American civic organizations as a rebuke to decades of discrimination and violence and as a reminder to their neighbors that Italians have been here since this objectionable Genoa-born adventurer set foot in this hemisphere in 1492, well before a bunch of equally creepy blond Protestants followed in his wake? Between 1886 and 1915, at least 46 Italian immigrants were lynched in Mississippi, Florida, Illinois, West Virginia, Colorado and elsewhere, including the 11 slain by a New Orleans mob in 1891  after some of them had been tried for murder and acquitted. After 1915, when D. W. Griffith’s \"The Birth of a Nation\" reinvigorated the Ku Klux Klan, Italian-Americans joined blacks and Jews on the terrorists’ list of targets. So while Columbus, as Mayor de Blasio put it politically, \"may suggest hate,\" how many of his statues were originally put up to tone down hate? I nevertheless suspect that some of the increasingly vandalized Columbus edifices are not long for this world, but Italian-Americans will make themselves heard about what replaces them. I see many a Columbus monument’s future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen. Going forward, public commissions devoted to sorting out this quagmire should look to Maya Lin’s Confluence Project in the Pacific Northwest. Six sites along the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon commemorate the Lewis and Clark expedition from the point of view of the people and ecology the explorers encountered. I’ve been to the \"bird blind\" in the woods of the Sandy River Delta outside Portland, an elegant, elliptical treehouse composed of wooden slats engraved with the names of the animal species the Corps of Discovery documented, some of them now labeled extinct, endangered or a \"species of concern.\" The visitor brings everything she knows or does not know. I know that when William Clark camped nearby in November 1805, he \"could not sleep\" because of the \"horrid\" noise of swans, geese and ducks. I know Captain Clark’s slave York accompanied him on the voyage. I know that Sacagawea was Shoshone and that she was captured as a child by the Hidatsa and that the hopeful hordes who followed in her traveling companions’ footsteps in the subsequent decades were not to be good news for the Shoshone or the Hidatsa. I know that the Louisiana Purchase Lewis and Clark marveled at is where the United States government would shoo some of my forebears when they were spat out of the East, and that even though a fourth of them died along the way, the Cherokee Nation still has the largest population of any American Indian tribe, close to 360,000 enrolled members, and I am one of them. Knowing none of that, a lighthearted visitor could also just stand still in Maya Lin’s humble contraption and be only delighted, ogling the sky between her wood slats and listening to the birds that kept William Clark up at night, reliving none of the hideous memories and hearing only the beautiful songs.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/opinion/sunday/confederate-statues-lee-family.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'How First-Generation College Students Do Thanksgiving Break', 'text': ' LINCOLN, Neb. — In 1999, I had been a freshman in college in upstate New York for maybe two weeks — it was still September, no one had gotten winter jackets out yet — when my classmates started booking their flights home for Thanksgiving. They couldn’t wait. They regaled me with stories of family traditions and exotic-sounding food I’d never tried (cranberry sauce) and in some cases never even heard of (green bean casserole). I hadn’t been planning to go anywhere, and certainly hadn’t budgeted for it. My Miami-based Cuban family didn’t normally celebrate Thanksgiving, although we did try to make a turkey once, a mistake we’d never repeat. I was the first person in my family to go to college, so I already felt different from my peers in large and small ways. But their excitement about the break took that feeling to a new level. The trip home to Miami was too pricey for me, and in late November the semester was, technically, almost over, but learning that the default for most college students was heading home made me change plans. I wanted to be a typical college student, too. I used a new credit card to book a last-minute flight to Miami and showed up, without warning, at my parents’ house. They were thankfully happy to see me, but couldn’t understand why I came, saying with a shrug, \"Oh, well, I guess we better do a Thanksgiving now.\" My sophomore year, I was a resident adviser, and since I wouldn’t be repeating the previous year’s impulse buy, I volunteered to cover my dorm’s on-call duties over Thanksgiving, an assignment that no one wanted because it meant you couldn’t leave campus or even the building itself, after a certain hour. I was still not prepared for how dead campus would feel. I thought I’d pick up extra shifts at my work-study job: Wrong — the campus movie theater was closed. Fine, I thought, I’ll get to study in the choice spots at the library: Wrong — the libraries were closed. Fine, fine, at least I’ll get to eat at the dining hall that normally has long lines: The only campus dining hall that was open, with very limited hours, was not the good one. The students like me who stayed had certain similarities, I noticed. We mostly spoke a language other than English at home. We tended to be the first in our families to go to college, or we were the first in our families to be born in America — or we weren’t Americans at all. We hadn’t made good enough friends to get an invitation to some strange family’s celebration, but that was mostly a relief. It meant we weren’t going to be asked uncomfortable questions about our \"heritage.\" Years later, working as a college access counselor in Los Angeles, I told my students what I’d told myself: \"It’s not worth it,\" I’d say, knowing part of me was lying. I knew full well how lonely they might be over Thanksgiving break, how the emptiness of campus might amplify their feelings of alienation. The breaks I spent at Cornell made me see how my college hadn’t wholly anticipated someone like me there. My students, all of them from low-income families, would probably see that, too. Our organization typically paid for students’ flights home for winter break precisely because their families couldn’t afford them, so when they came home on their own dime for Thanksgiving, it sometimes vexed us. But then I’d think back to my freshman year impulse buy, my credit card bill. It made sense. I’m now a professor at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. When I create my course calendar for the fall, I always plan it so that I can cancel classes for the whole week of Thanksgiving. I do this as a favor to my former self, and to the current versions of those students with whom I worked, all of us who wander around empty dining halls in November, wondering what, exactly, we’re missing. The extra time gives my students more options: potentially cheaper flights, a little less debt on that credit card, a little more flexibility should they find themselves so lonely that three more weeks to winter break feels like forever. Now that I look back, I don’t mind that I learned about Thanksgiving the hard way because it let me reinvent the holiday for myself. I do it differently almost every year. I have celebrated in Duluth, Minn. (my first Thanksgiving with white Americans, where I brought tostones, which no one ate); in San Francisco (at a restaurant where someone else paid and someone’s drunk grandma asked what kind of pies I liked to make); and in Champaign, Ill.

I am perfecting a recipe for pumpkin flan, which a friend from Iowa recently suggested I call \"pumpkin custard\" so that the Nebraskans will try it. \"They don’t know flan,\" she warned. So fine, I’ll explain that flan is a lot like custard, but only if anyone feels the need to ask. Because there will also be green bean casserole, and though it’s not something I know, I’ve learned to try it. And if for whatever reasons no one wants to eat flan, that’s also fine.

That record testifies to the power and influence of America as well as the skill of secretaries of state and other diplomats who worked to advance international stability and the national interest. That isn’t the way the Trump administration approaches the world. Rex Tillerson is widely seen as ill suited to diplomatic leadership and determined to dismantle his own department, which has been central to America’s national security since Thomas Jefferson ran the place. The department is being undermined by budget cuts, a failure to fill top jobs, an erratic president and a secretary who has called reorganization, rather than policy, his most important priority. Given the aggressive behavior of North Korea, Russia and China in a world that seems shakier by the day, the timing could hardly be worse. Meanwhile, the Pentagon is going gangbusters. The State Department’s budget has been targeted with a 31 percent cut, to $37.6 billion, but Congress is moving to raise the Pentagon’s spending level roughly 15 percent from the $549 billion allowed under the Budget Control Act. Aircraft carriers and tanks are obviously much more expensive than diplomatic pouches and airline tickets. Even so, such lopsided budget priorities could favor military solutions over diplomacy and development. In recent weeks, alarming new data from the American Foreign Service Association, the union representing diplomats, shows just how far Mr. Tillerson has taken things. Since January, more than 100 senior foreign service officers have left the department, depleting the ranks of career ambassadors, the diplomatic equivalent of four-star generals, by 60 percent, while the number of career ministers (akin to three-star generals) is down 42 percent. The hiring of new foreign service officers has slowed almost to a halt, and the number of young people seeking to take the foreign service exam has fallen to less than half the 17,000 who registered two years ago. Mr. Tillerson has asked some senior officials to do clerical tasks and left many ambassadorships unfilled. Stephen Akard, an associate of Vice President Mike Pence with only brief experience at the State Department, was nominated director general of the foreign service, a position that oversees diplomatic appointments and is usually reserved for a senior career diplomat with the power to block political interference. All in all, Mr. Tillerson is disrupting the smooth development of career State Department leaders from entry level to the senior ranks, which will create shortages of experienced diplomats down the road. Not surprisingly, morale has plummeted. By contrast, there have been no comparable recent moves by the military services to suspend the commissioning of officers, and even as the diplomatic corps erodes, Congress just approved a Pentagon budget for next year that would boost troops by 20,000. Mr. Tillerson is no doubt correct that the State Department, like any bureaucracy, could benefit from scrutiny and thoughtful reform. For that reason, many people there welcomed Mr. Tillerson, with his long experience as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, as someone who could modernize the place and introduce efficiencies. He has already enacted one broadly popular reform by shrinking the number of special envoys assigned to special diplomatic tasks. But over all, Mr. Tillerson has shown that business experience isn’t easily transferable to government, where the driver is not the bottom line but the national interest. An engineer, he seems obsessed with management minutiae and metrics; last week, for instance, his deputy secretary spent part of a senior staff meeting telling his underlings how to write effective memos to the boss. Mr. Tillerson seems no less obsessed with control, recently telling senior officials that henceforth his office, not they, would issue the boilerplate statements recognizing this or that country’s national day. Critics faulted James Baker for relying too heavily on a small coterie of aides when he served as President George H. W. Bush’s secretary of state. But those aides all had previous government experience, and Mr. Baker eventually came to integrate career diplomats into his decision-making team. For the most part, Mr. Tillerson’s close aides have no such experience, and the professional diplomats who should be part of his team feel alienated and disrespected. What this means, in practice, is an incoherent policy toward China and North Korea, and lesser failures elsewhere. There is still no American ambassador in South Korea, thus weakening the ability to develop a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis. There is no sign the administration has a plan for dealing with Syria, now that the Islamic State has been degraded, leaving Russia and Iran in commanding roles. Exactly what’s behind this wholesale downgrading of the department is unclear. Mr. Trump seems to have little love for professional diplomats, 1,000 of whom formally protested the president’s Muslim travel ban in January. Policy shifts play a role, too. When Mr. Tillerson made clear that human rights concerns would be subordinated, the office handling those issues began to shrink. The near-term hope of arresting or reversing this slide lies with Congress. More lawmakers are raising their voices, warning about the dangers to national security and demanding answers. In a letter to Mr. Tillerson on Wednesday, Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, expressed alarm over the department’s \"questionable management practices\"; \"declining morale, recruitment and retention\"; and inexperienced leadership. \"America’s diplomatic power is being weakened internally as complex global crises are growing externally,\" they said. Maybe Mr. Tillerson will get every diplomat to write perfectly formatted memos and achieve his targeted staff reductions. When it comes time to judge his tenure, however, historians will care only about this: What did he do to forestall war with North Korea, manage the rise of China, check Russia’s efforts to undermine democracy, lay the groundwork for postwar stability in Syria and Iraq, and protect America’s international standing?', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/the-trump-administration-is-making-war-on-diplomacy.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Dear Nobel Winners, Mr. Trump Has All the Brains He Needs', 'text': ' Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama invited America’s Nobel Prize winners to the White House most years, to celebrate their achievements and thank them for their discoveries. This year, the American winners of Nobels in physics, chemistry, economics and physiology were lauded at the Swedish Embassy in Washington. They received no invitation to meet President Trump. The White House didn’t give a firm reason for this, using the president’s travel schedule as an excuse. But like scientists, we can hypothesize. Perhaps Mr. Trump, who has canceled the White House Science Fair, appointed a radio talk show host as the Department of Agriculture’s chief scientist and nobody at all as White House science adviser, isn’t big on research’s value to society. The Nobel winners weren’t exactly beating down the White House door hoping to get in. The biophysicist Joachim Frank, awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in microscopy, said he was \"relieved\" not to be visiting Mr. Trump. Referring to his fellow American laureates, he said, \"I strongly believe that as thinking, intelligent people, they will have a similar attitude as I.\" After all, imagine how intimidating it could be even for celebrated geniuses to match wits with Mr. Trump, who has noted, \"I have a very good brain,\" and \"I’m a very intelligent person.\" The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics went to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne, members of the LIGO-Virgo detector collaboration that discovered gravitational waves. According to the Nobel Committee: \"The waves, which were predicted by Albert Einstein a hundred years ago, came from a collision between two black holes. It took 1.3 billion years for the waves to arrive at the LIGO\" — the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory detector in the United States. The LIGO registered the wave as a tone nicknamed the \"cosmic chirp.\" Try explaining why a tiny, far-off chirp should matter to Mr. Trump, who has been known to blast off half a dozen tweets before most people even arrive at their LIGOs in the morning. Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their research into how the human \"biological clock\" helps to regulate behavior, metabolism and sleep. It could shatter decades of painstaking research to face a president who says his \"great temperament for success\" comes from near-total sleep deprivation: \"I’m not a big sleeper, I like three hours, four hours, I toss, I turn, I beep-de-beep, I want to find out what’s going on.\" Richard Thaler won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for using insights into human behavior to improve public policies, like automatic enrollment in employee retirement savings programs. Mr. Thaler established that people’s behavior consistently defies economic theory — they refuse to pay more for umbrellas during rainstorms, for example. His work, the committee said, explores \"the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences and lack of self-control.\" What could he possibly teach this president about that?', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/dear-nobel-winners-mr-trump-has-all-the-brains-he-needs.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Better Way to Elect a President?', 'text': ' To the Editor: Re \"Let the People Pick the President\" (editorial, Nov. 8): The Electoral College needs to be mended, not ended. Rather than replace our winner-take-all system in most states with awarding electors based on the national popular vote, which would result in a cascade of challenges, particularly in a close election, the best option is for our states to change the way they allocate their electoral votes. I propose that each state’s electoral votes be divided proportionally based on the actual vote count in that state, with the winner receiving a guaranteed two electoral votes. A proportional system for allocating electoral votes would force presidential candidates to run truly national campaigns instead of concentrating on just the swing states. It would preserve federalism, strengthen our democracy, increase turnout, restore voters from all states to a meaningful role in presidential campaigns, and require neither a constitutional amendment nor an interstate compact. RICHARD KAVESH, NYACK, N.Y. To the Editor: The Electoral College is not only a bad idea, but also violates basic principles of voter equality. Under the Electoral College structure, smaller states have enormous political leverage. Wyoming has a population of about 585,000 and has three electoral votes. California has a population of more than 39 million and has 55 electoral votes. So each presidential vote in Wyoming is worth 3.6 times more than each vote in California. If this discrepancy occurred within each state — if the voters in one county had 3.6 times the voting power of voters in another county — that would violate the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. So the \"one person one vote\" rule applies to every election in the United States, except for the vote for president. A lawsuit should be brought to end this ridiculous practice, which was created out of a distrust of democracy. We must eliminate this anachronistic, harmful practice. LEON FRIEDMAN, NEW YORK The writer is a professor of constitutional law at Hofstra Law School. To the Editor: Another good reason to void or avoid the Electoral College is highlighted by Russia’s tampering with the 2016 election. It would be much easier to flip a presidential election by hacking the vote count of a few key states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania (which Donald Trump won by only 77,000 combined votes) than by hacking the entire United States. \"Let the American People Pick the President.\" DOUG GREERMORGAN HILL, CALIF. To the Editor: You point out that \"modern presidential campaigns ignore almost all states, large and small alike, in favor of a handful that are closely divided between Republicans and Democrats.\" The defects of the Electoral College aside, I have never understood why it is that we sustain a system that perpetually assigns such a lopsided share of the presidential-picking process to Iowa and New Hampshire, sites of, respectively, the first major caucus and the first primary. By the time these two events are over, numerous candidates have usually been eliminated from the pack, without any input whatsoever from any voters in 48 of the states. Iowa and New Hampshire are delightful places, but there is nothing in the air or drinking water of either state that confers upon their residents any special wisdom in judging presidential timber. Modest proposal: Why not have a different primary schedule each election year, using a lottery system to determine the order? DAVID ENGLISH, ACTON, MASS. To the Editor: Eliminating the Electoral College would remove the injustice of a candidate receiving almost half a state’s votes while gaining none of its electors, but it would disenfranchise large segments of our country. A pure majority-vote system, while not inherently unfair, would require campaigns to focus almost exclusively on large population centers. A better system would be to have electors selected by the winner of each congressional district. Maine and Nebraska already use this method. Of course there might be a focus on districts that are more \"competitive,\" but they would be spread across many regions. Since congressional districts are designed to be proportional, it would bring us closer to achieving the intended \"one person one vote\" goal. DAVID P. MIRANDA, ALBANY To the Editor: You cite the disproportionately high percentage of presidential campaign events targeting a small number of voters in a handful of swing states as one reason for changing the Electoral College system. However, there is one exception to this campaign event disparity. Presidential candidates travel disproportionately to wealthy states, like Massachusetts, for the sole purpose of collecting campaign donations at private events. Unfortunately, both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates campaign for my money, but not for my vote. PETER LIFTONLEXINGTON, MASS. To the Editor: You are right that adopting the National Popular Vote compact — where every state gives its electoral votes to whoever wins the nation’s popular vote — would be a huge step toward fairer democracy. As it stands, though, National Popular Vote is unenforceable. Suppose that Ted Cruz or Sarah Palin is leading slightly in a future three-way race for president. Will the people of New York, Illinois and California really meekly give him or her all of their electoral votes? Or will their legislators withdraw from the compact as fast as they can? To make National Popular Vote enforceable, states need to put the pact into their constitutions. National Popular Vote will work only if it is hard to withdraw from. MARK WESTON, SARASOTA, FLA. The writer is the author of \"The Runner-Up Presidency: The Elections That Defied America’s Popular Will.\" To the Editor: Your editorial is correct that the Electoral College must be superseded. But the details of the interstate National Popular Vote compact as currently written are suboptimal. Instead of giving the presidency to the plurality winner in a seven-candidate race, instant runoff would ensure that the majority decides between the two top candidates. Compact opponents who present nightmare scenarios of endless vote recounts and litigation in close elections can be won over by using the popular vote only when one candidate has won a clear victory margin of one million votes or a 1 percent margin in the popular vote. Thus a recount litigation in a razor-thin election would be limited to only one or two contested states. It is beyond dispute that the candidate who wins the popular vote by millions of votes should become president. THOMAS O’BRIENCHARLOTTESVILLE, VA. To the Editor: I wholeheartedly support doing away with, or otherwise bypassing, the Electoral College. I suggest that a sister initiative should be a legal requirement that all eligible voters vote in national elections. As reported by CNN, only 55 percent of the eligible electorate voted in last year’s election, which constituted a 20-year low. The idea that democracy can exist when almost half of the population abstains from participation is an insult to our intelligence and an affront to the international role the United States purports to play as a champion of democratic freedom. Countries that have led the way in this regard include Belgium, Australia and Brazil. Such a requirement, which would allow the individual to vote freely for anyone, including people not on the official slate, would put an end to artificially constructed barriers to access to the polls that we have seen in recent years and would complement your proposed reform. PETER WYER, NEW YORK', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/president-electoral-college.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The Hillary Effect', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — Would the war against preying on women be blazing so fiercely had Hillary Clinton been elected? When I interviewed women in Hollywood about the ugly Harvey Weinstein revelations in The Times and The New Yorker, they told me that feelings of frustration and disgust at having an accused predator in the White House instead of the first woman president had helped give the story velocity. When I talked to Susan Fowler, after her blog post about sexual harassment at Uber that toppled its C.E.O., Travis Kalanick, she said that before Donald Trump’s election, women in Silicon Valley were speaking up but no one was listening. \"I think it was different this year because Trump won and people felt powerless,\" she said. \"I know I did. I felt super powerless. Because I felt, with Obama in the White House, I could just take for granted that good people were in charge.\" It is also interesting to speculate: If Hillary were in the Oval, would some women have failed to summon the courage to tell their Weinstein horror stories because the producer was also a power behind the Clinton throne? As Janice Min, the former editor of The Hollywood Reporter, told me, when Barack Obama stepped off a stage and into Weinstein’s arms for a big hug after giving a $400,000 speech as an ex-president in the spring, it sent a signal that the ogre was in a protected magic circle. And, finally, would Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and other liberals still be saying in the past few days that Bill Clinton should have resigned the presidency over his own sexual misdeeds if he now occupied the first lady’s quarters and reigned over a potent Clinton political machine? Or would feminists and liberals make the same Faustian bargain they made in 1998: protect Bill on his retrogressive behavior toward women because the Clintons have progressive policies toward women? So what if a few women are collateral damage, they might ask — again. Wouldn’t you rather have Bill and Bill’s enabler, Hillary, than Donald? You may wonder why in the year 2017, after so many graphic and scalding national seminars on sexual predation over the last 26 years, we are still trying to come to terms with it. Perhaps because in those earlier traumatic sagas, both the left and the right rushed in to twist them for their own ideological ends. The stench of hypocrisy overpowered the perfume of justice. First, with Clarence Thomas, a feminist lynch mob tried to kill off a conservative Supreme Court nominee over sex when the real reason they wanted to get rid of him was politics. Then, with Bill Clinton, a conservative lynch mob tried to kill off a Democratic president over sex when the real reason they wanted to get rid of him was politics. Institutional feminism died when Gloria Steinem, Madeleine Albright and other top feminists vouched for President Clinton as he brazenly lied about never having had a sexual relationship with \"that woman\" — Monica Lewinsky. The Clintons and feminists were outraged when Thomas’s supporters painted Anita Hill as \"a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty.\" Yet that was precisely the Clintonian tack when women spoke up about Bill’s misbehaving. Time and again, Hillary was a party to demonizing women as liars, bimbos, trailer trash or troubled souls when it seemed clear they were truthful about her philandering husband. She often justified this by thinking of the women as instruments of the right-wing conspiracy. As I reported in ’98, even some veteran Clinton henchmen felt a little nauseated about the debate inside the White House on a slander strategy for Lewinsky: Should they paint her as a friendly fantasist or a malicious stalker? Following the Clintons’ lead, Trump dismissed the more than dozen women who stood up to accuse him of sexual transgressions as politically motivated liars. The president has also politicized the accusations against Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and Democratic Senator Al Franken. In the first case, despite heinous reports painting Moore as haunting a mall to cruise for teenage girls, Trump has refused to disavow the Stephen Bannon-backed candidate, at one point claiming he didn’t know enough about Moore to comment because he does \"not watch much television.\" (!!) In the case of Franken, the president has been happily tweeting his opprobrium and suggesting Franken might have done worse: \"The Al Frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words. Where do his hands go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 while she sleeps?\" Ivanka Trump said that she has \"no reason to doubt the victims’ accounts\" in the Moore case, but she doesn’t feel the same about her dad’s accusers. And Bannon dismissed the report of Moore’s despicable behavior by saying that it was, just like Trump’s \"Access Hollywood\" remarks, first published in The Washington Post — which he calls \"part of the apparatus of the Democratic Party.\" Are the liberals who now say Bill should have resigned because they want to clear the decks to better go after President Trump, thinking that sex may be a more effective weapon than Russia to bring him down? It’s easy to turn on the Clintons these days and treat them as collateral damage, the way the Clintons treated all those women who got tangled up with Bill. Once more, politics is clouding the issue of sexual harassment. But hopefully this public trial, which is bringing to the dock men on both sides of the aisle, is too momentous to be diminished by politics. As Senator Franken’s accuser, Leeann Tweeden, a Los Angeles radio newscaster, told CNN’s Jake Tapper: \"When you’re sexually assaulted, it doesn’t matter if you’re a Republican or a Democrat. … The affiliation doesn’t matter, right?\" \"That’s not,\" she correctly concluded, \"the point here.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/the-hillary-effect.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'What if Ken Starr Was Right?', 'text': ' In the longstanding liberal narrative about Bill Clinton and his scandals, the one pushed by Clinton courtiers and ratified in media coverage of his post-presidency, our 42nd president was only guilty of being a horndog, his affairs were nobody’s business but his family’s, and oral sex with Monica Lewinsky was a small thing that should never have put his presidency in peril. That narrative could not survive the current wave of outrage over male sexual misconduct. So now a new one may be forming for the age of Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump. In this story, Kenneth Starr and the Republicans are still dismissed as partisan witch hunters. But liberals might be willing to concede that the Lewinsky affair was a pretty big deal morally, a clear abuse of sexual power, for which Clinton probably should have been pressured to resign. This new narrative lines up with what’s often been my own assessment of the Clinton scandals. I have never been a Clinton hater; indeed, I’ve always been a little mystified by the scale of Republican dislike for the most centrist of recent Democratic leaders. So I’ve generally held what I’ve considered a sensible middle-ground position on his sins — that he should have stepped down when the Lewinsky affair came to light, but that the Republican effort to impeach him was a hopeless attempt to legislate against dishonor. But a moment of reassessment is a good time to reassess things for yourself, so I spent this week reading about the lost world of the 1990s. I skimmed the Starr Report. I leafed through books by George Stephanopoulos and Joe Klein and Michael Isikoff. I dug into Troopergate and Whitewater and other first-term scandals. I reacquainted myself with Gennifer Flowers and Webb Hubbell, James Riady and Marc Rich. After doing all this reading, I’m not sure my reasonable middle ground is actually reasonable. It may be that the conservatives of the 1990s were simply right about Clinton, that once he failed to resign he really deserved to be impeached. Yes, the Republicans were too partisan, the Starr Report was too prurient and Clinton’s haters generated various absurd conspiracy theories. But the Clinton operation was also extraordinarily sordid, in ways that should be thrown into particular relief by the absence of similar scandals in the Obama administration, which had perfervid enemies and circling investigators as well. The sexual misconduct was the heart of things, but everything connected to Clinton’s priapism was bad: the use of the perks of office to procure women, willing and unwilling; the frequent use of that same power to buy silence and bully victims; and yes, the brazen public lies and perjury. Something like Troopergate, for instance, in which Arkansas state troopers claimed to have served as Clinton’s panderers and been offered jobs to buy their silence, is often recalled as just a right-wing hit job. But if you read The Los Angeles Times’s reporting on the allegations (which included phone records confirming the troopers’ account of a mistress Clinton was seeing during his presidential transition) and Stephanopoulos’s portrayal of Clinton’s behavior in the White House when the story broke, the story seems like it was probably mostly true. I have less confidence about what was real in the miasma of Whitewater. But with Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky, we know what happened: A president being sued for sexual harassment tried to buy off a mistress-turned-potential-witness with White House favors, and then committed perjury serious enough to merit disbarment. Which also brought forward a compelling allegation from Juanita Broaddrick that the president had raped her. The longer I spent with these old stories, the more I came back to a question: If exploiting a willing intern is a serious enough abuse of power to warrant resignation, why is obstructing justice in a sexual harassment case not serious enough to warrant impeachment? Especially when the behavior is part of a longstanding pattern that also may extend to rape? Would any feminist today hesitate to take a similar opportunity to remove a predatory studio head or C.E.O.? There is a common liberal argument that our present polarization is the result of constant partisan escalations on the right — the rise of Newt Gingrich, the steady Hannitization of right-wing media. Some of this is true. But returning to the impeachment imbroglio made me think that in that case the most important escalators were the Democrats. They had an opportunity, with Al Gore waiting in the wings, to show a predator the door and establish some moral common ground for a polarizing country. And what they did instead — turning their party into an accessory to Clinton’s appetites, shamelessly abandoning feminist principle, smearing victims and blithely ignoring his most credible accuser, all because Republicans funded the investigations and they’re prudes and it’s all just Sexual McCarthyism  — feels in the cold clarity of hindsight like a great act of partisan deformation. For which, it’s safe to say, we have all been amply punished since.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/what-if-ken-starr-was-right.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Blue States Practice the Family Values Red States Preach', 'text': ' As we watch Roy Moore thumping his Bible to defend himself from accusations of child molestation, let me toss out a verbal hand grenade: To some degree, liberals practice the values that conservatives preach. This is complicated terrain with lots of exceptions, and the recent scandals involving Harvey Weinstein, Louis C.K. and Al Franken underscore that liberals can be skunks as much as anyone else. Yet if one looks at blue and red state populations as a whole, it’s striking that conservatives champion \"family values\" even as red states have high rates of teenage births, divorce and prostitution. In contrast, people in blue states don’t trumpet these family values but often seem to do a better job living them. According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey of 32 states, those with the highest percentage of high school students who say they have had sex are Mississippi, Delaware, West Virginia, Alabama and Arkansas. All but Delaware voted Republican in the last presidential election. Meanwhile, the five states with the lowest proportion of high school students who have had sex were New York, California, Maryland, Nebraska and Connecticut. All but Nebraska voted Democratic. When evangelical kids have sex, they’re less likely to use birth control — and that may be a reason (along with lower abortion rates) that red states have high teen birthrates. Nine of the 10 states with the highest teen birthrates voted Republican in 2016. And nine of the 10 states with the lowest teen birthrates voted Democratic. \"Red regions of the country have higher teen pregnancy rates, more shotgun marriages and lower average ages at marriage and first birth,\" Naomi Cahn and June Carbone wrote in their important 2010 book, \"Red Families v. Blue Families.\" The liberal impulse may be to gloat: Those conservatives thunder about \"family values\" but don’t practice them. But there’s also perhaps a measure of hypocrisy in the blue states. As Cahn and Carbone put it: \"Blue family values bristle at restrictions on sexuality, insistence on marriage or the stigmatization of single parents. Their secret, however, is that they encourage their children to simultaneously combine public tolerance with private discipline, and their children then overwhelmingly choose to raise their own children within two-parent families.\" Liberals, in other words, may be wary of strict moral codes, but they want to make damn sure that their own kids don’t have babies while in high school. It helps that they believe in comprehensive sex education and reliable birth control. The conservative hostility to premarital sex also sometimes leads to early weddings, even to child marriages. I wrote in May about the hundreds of thousands of child marriages in America, and of the dozen states with the highest rates of child marriage, all voted Republican in 2016. \"Child marriage is happening at an alarming rate across the U.S., but available marriage-license data show more parents, judges and clerks in red states than in blue states seem comfortable with this human-rights abuse,\" said Fraidy Reiss, founder of Unchained at Last, a nonprofit that fights child marriage. Divorce rates show a similar pattern: They tend to be higher in red states than in blue states, with Arkansas highest of all. \"Individual religious conservatism is positively related to individual divorce risk,\" according to a 50-state study reported in the American Journal of Sociology. Then there’s adultery and prostitution. One large international survey found that the largest group of customers on Ashley Madison, the dating website for married people, were evangelical Christians. And a major 2013 study found that men in the Houston and Kansas City metro areas were the most likely to call sex ads, while men in San Francisco and Baltimore were the least likely to. Yet it’s complicated, and there is one religious group that is extremely good at living conservative family values: Mormons. Utah stands out for low teen birthrates, low divorce rates and low abortion rates, and it has the highest rate of teenagers living with married, biological parents. More broadly, conservative values don’t directly lead to premarital sex or divorce. Rather, statistical analysis suggests that religious conservatives end up divorcing partly because they marry early, are less likely to go to college and are disproportionately poor. So the deeper problem seems to be the political choices that conservatives make, underinvesting in public education and social services (including contraception). This underinvestment leaves red states poorer and less educated — and thus prone to a fraying of the social fabric. So let’s drop the wars over family values. Liberals and conservatives alike don’t want kids pregnant at 16, and we almost all seek committed marriages that last. It’s worth noting that Bible-thumping blowhards like Roy Moore don’t help achieve those values, while investments in education and family planning do. • It’s time for my annual win-a-trip contest, in which I choose a university student to accompany me on a reporting trip.

In it, a mother elephant and her baby are running across a road in West Bengal, India. The mother has her head down and ears forward, heading for safety in the trees. A ball of fire clings to her right foot; her tail appears singed. The baby’s hind legs are engulfed in flames. In the background, a crowd of men is running away, some pausing to gape and jeer over their shoulders. They are the reason for the fire. They have thrown firecrackers and balls of flaming tar at the animals. The image, taken by Biplab Hazra and chosen by the Indian conservation group Sanctuary Asia as this year’s winner of its annual wildlife photography contest, is titled \"Hell Is Here.\" Where elephants go, unfortunately, hell seems to follow. Over the past two decades, the global populations of both Asian and African elephants have declined precipitously because of poaching, habitat loss caused by human encroachment and subsequent conflicts resulting from the crowding together of people and very large animals. As part of an international effort to curb poaching and protect elephants, the Obama administration tightened restrictions on the domestic sale of ivory and on legal commercial hunting in Africa. In 2014 it implemented a ban that prohibited Americans from importing trophies from hunts in Zimbabwe. On Thursday the Trump administration announced that it would lift the ban and earlier this month said it would allow trophies from Zambia as well. Hunting advocacy groups and the National Rifle Association celebrated the decision. It was not too difficult to imagine that the president’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., would also cheer this change — they have hunted elephants for sport in the past. Don Jr. even posed in Zimbabwe in 2011, ammunition slung around his waist, holding up the tail he had cut off a dead elephant lying behind him. Criticism of the decision was swift from other corners, however. Perhaps swift enough to give the president pause: Late Friday, he tweeted that he was putting the \"big game trophy decision on hold\" for further review. I hope a review convinces him to let the ban stand because the last thing elephants need is more people shooting them. Between 1979 and 1988, more than half of Africa’s elephant population was killed for the ivory trade, some 700,000 animals. After widespread outcry, bans were put in place and conservation efforts strengthened, and elephant populations slowly recovered into this century, when, conservation advocates say, China’s ascendant middle class began fueling a rising demand for ivory with price seemingly no object: $1,000 for a pair of chopsticks, hundreds of times that for a whole carved tusk. Between 2002 and 2011, 62 percent of African forest elephants vanished, and between 2007 and 2014, the numbers of savanna elephants dropped by nearly a third, with tens of thousands killed each year. Poachers, increasingly soldiers and members of rogue militias from the Central African Republic and Sudan, among other countries, shoot elephants with automatic rifles, on foot or from helicopters. They poison water holes, killing tuskless animals as collateral damage. They kill park rangers who get in their way and swell their own ranks with kidnapped villagers. Income from the sale of the tusks is used to buy weapons and prolong gruesome human conflicts. Organized crime syndicates make fortunes bringing ivory to market, mostly in East Asia. Like many people, I have loved elephants since I was a small child. And I am afraid for them. There is a real possibility that elephants will vanish in the not distant future. Elephants draw charisma from their wondrous size, but that brings vulnerability, too. They are large targets in every way. They can’t dart away into the underbrush to hide from bullets; they need vast amounts of food and water, and space to roam. A group of elephants obliviously crossing a farmer’s field in Africa or Southeast Asia can do enough damage with their huge feet and foraging trunks to bring about both economic ruin and their own consequent demise. But the elephants in Mr. Hazra’s photo had not accidentally trampled anyone. Their attackers weren’t seeking profit, nor were they wealthy trophy enthusiasts like the Trump sons or the founders of GoDaddy and Jimmy John’s, who appear to have all been willing to pay between $25,000 and $60,000 to kill an elephant and take home pieces of its body. The men in West Bengal burned the animals for pleasure. Those who kill and torment elephants seem to experience the animals’ size as a provocation. The attendant desire to gawk and jeer at elephants brought low is an old one. In 1903, to cite one famous example, an Asian elephant, Topsy, was publicly executed by a combination of poison, electrocution and strangulation on Coney Island. Edison Manufacturing Co. sent a film crew to document the event, and so it lives on. Topsy’s death has been viewed more than 760,000 times on YouTube. All this despite the fact that we know elephants to be among the most intelligent and emotionally complex animals on the planet. Elephants play, mimic, use tools, and communicate with a wide vocabulary ranging from blasting trumpets to low frequency rumbles that can travel miles. Within their close-knit matriarchal herds, they cooperate and make group decisions. They seem able to recognize, even predict, distress in other individuals and to offer assistance. A sliver of hope for elephants emerged last year when China, by far the biggest consumer of ivory, announced it would ban its domestic trade. This long-sought reversal was the result of sustained foreign pressure and shifting internal attitudes, nudged along by personal pleas and educational campaigns from celebrities such as Yao Ming and Prince William. What could justify the commercial hunting of threatened animals? The general answer is that the proceeds from the hunt — the huge fees people in search of these trophies fork over — can go to conservation. Whether or not such an argument is morally persuasive, the implementation of such a system requires a stable host country where corruption is kept in check and conservation programs are effective. Elephant trophies can legally be taken from South Africa, for example, but the 2014 ban reflected the United States Fish and Wildlife Service’s conclusion that Zimbabwe had not demonstrated its hunts were furthering the preservation of the species. Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s longtime dictator who is currently under house arrest after a military coup, reportedly dined on elephant meat for his birthday two years ago. His attitude toward his country’s wildlife is best described as pay-for-slay. Hell is here, for elephants.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/protecting-elephants.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Our Love Affair With Digital Is Over', 'text': ' A decade ago I bought my first smartphone, a clunky little BlackBerry 8830 that came in a sleek black leather sheath. I loved that phone. I loved the way it effortlessly slid in and out of its case, loved the soft purr it emitted when an email came in, loved the silent whoosh of its trackball as I played Brick Breaker on the subway and the feel of its baby keys clicking under my fat thumbs. It was the world in my hands, and when I had to turn it off, I felt anxious and alone. Like most relationships we plunge into with hearts aflutter, our love affair with digital technology promised us the world: more friends, money and democracy! Free music, news and same-day shipping of paper towels! A laugh a minute, and a constant party at our fingertips. Many of us bought into the fantasy that digital made everything better. We surrendered to this idea, and mistook our dependence for romance, until it was too late. Today, when my phone is on, I feel anxious and count down the hours to when I am able to turn it off and truly relax. The love affair I once enjoyed with digital technology is over — and I know I’m not alone. Ten years after the iPhone first swept us off our feet, the growing mistrust of computers in both our personal lives and the greater society we live in is inescapable. This publishing season is flush with books raising alarms about digital technology’s pernicious effects on our lives: what smartphones are doing to our children; how Facebook and Twitter are eroding our democratic institutions; and the economic effects of tech monopolies. A recent Pew Research Center survey noted that more than 70 percent of Americans were worried about automation’s impact on jobs, while just 21 percent of respondents to a Quartz survey said they trust Facebook with their personal information. Nearly half of millennials worry about the negative effects of social media on their mental and physical health, according to the American Psychiatric Association. So what now? As much as we might fantasize about it, we probably won’t delete our social media accounts and toss our phones in the nearest body of water. What we can do is to restore some sense of balance over our relationship with digital technology, and the best way to do that is with analog: the ying to digital’s yang. Thankfully, the analog world is still here, and not only is it surviving but, in many cases, it is thriving. Sales of old-fashioned print books are up for the third year in a row, according to the Association of American Publishers, while ebook sales have been declining. Independent bookstores have been steadily expanding for several years. Vinyl records have witnessed a decade-long boom in popularity (more than 200,000 newly pressed records are sold each week in the United States), while sales of instant-film cameras, paper notebooks, board games and Broadway tickets are all growing again. This surprising reversal of fortune for these apparently \"obsolete\" analog technologies is too often written off as nostalgia for a predigital time. But younger consumers who never owned a turntable and have few memories of life before the internet drive most of the current interest in analog, and often include those who work in Silicon Valley’s most powerful companies. Analog, although more cumbersome and costly than its digital equivalents, provides a richness of experience that is unparalleled with anything delivered through a screen. People are buying books because a book engages nearly all of their senses, from the smell of the paper and glue to the sight of the cover design and weight of the pages read, the sound of those sheets turning, and even the subtle taste of the ink on your fingertips. A book can be bought and sold, given and received, and displayed on a shelf for anyone to see. It can start conversations and cultivate romances. The limits of analog, which were once seen as a disadvantage, are increasingly one of the benefits people are turning to as a counterweight to the easy manipulation of digital. Though a page of paper is limited by its physical size and the permanence of the ink that marks it, there is a powerful efficiency in that simplicity. The person holding the pen above that notebook page is free to write, doodle or scribble her idea however she wishes between those borders, without the restrictions or distractions imposed by software. In a world of endless email chains, group chats, pop-up messages or endlessly tweaked documents and images, the walled garden of analog saves both time and inspires creativity. Web designers at Google have been required to use pen and paper as a first step when brainstorming new projects for the past several years, because it leads to better ideas than those begun on a screen. In contrast with the virtual \"communities\" we have built online, analog actually contributes to the real places where we live. I have become friendly with Ian Cheung, the appropriately opinionated owner of June Records, up the street from my home in Toronto. I benefit not only from the tax revenues that June Records contributes as a local business (paving the roads, paying my daughter’s teachers) but also from living nearby. Like the hardware store, Italian grocer and butcher on the same block, the brick and mortar presence of June adds to my neighborhood’s sense of place (i.e., a place with a killer selection of Cannonball Adderley and local indie albums) and gives me a feeling of belonging. I also have no doubts that, unlike Twitter, Ian would immediately kick out any Nazi or raving misogynist who started ranting inside his store. Analog excels particularly well at encouraging human interaction, which is crucial to our physical and mental well-being. The dynamic of a teacher working in a classroom full of students has not only proven resilient, but has outperformed digital learning experiments time and again. Digital may be extremely efficient in transferring pure information, but learning happens best when we build upon the relationships between students, teachers and their peers. We do not face a simple choice of digital or analog. That is the false logic of the binary code that computers are programmed with, which ignores the complexity of life in the real world. Instead, we are faced with a decision of how to strike the right balance between the two. If we keep that in mind, we are taking the first step toward a healthy relationship with all technology, and, most important, one another.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/internet-digital-technology-return-to-analog.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'travel': [{'title': 'When New York City Was a (Literal) Battlefield', 'text': ' New York City is a battlefield. I know what you’re thinking — psychological warfare, the endless grim clashing of economic forces — but I am being literal. When we ponder America’s defining war, the Revolution, we think of Bunker Hill, or Saratoga, or Lexington and Concord, yet its largest battle, a vast and ferociously fought chess match in August and September of 1776, right after the formal declaration of the colonies’ independence, ranged over what are now the five boroughs. As to why the place was so hotly contested, you already know the answer. Then, as now, as ever, New York City was the center of it all. Both sides believed that if the British took control of New York and the Hudson River, the American resistance would likely collapse. The battle isn’t as well known today as other encounters during the Revolution, in part because the city has done an excellent job of removing most traces of it. Where Boston sets aside hallowed historic precincts and wends a handsome brick Freedom Trail through its Revolutionary sites, New York City buries its past under mountains of concrete and steel. Hills have been flattened, islands swallowed up by landfill, shorelines redrawn. But I was determined to find Revolutionary New York, and I did eventually, after a fashion. It helped that I had an organizing principle. I was researching a book, and, since my book isn’t about military strategy I wasn’t trying to cover all of the complex maneuverings of troops. I write narrative history, which to me means focusing on people’s lives. Getting to know the places in which those lives unfolded helps me in my efforts to get into the individuals’ heads and hearts. The book tells the story of the founding era by following the interwoven stories of six people from the period, from birth to death. They include a Connecticut slave, a Seneca warrior, a British aristocrat and an Albany shoemaker. But it was because of the other two — a Virginia planter and the teenage daughter of a British officer — that I found myself going from subway to bus to ferry around the five boroughs, with old maps in one hand and Google Maps in the other. These two figures of 18th-century America were caught up in the mayhem of New York. They gave my journey through the city’s past what I always crave when I write, research or travel: a personal angle. George Washington is everyone’s touchstone for the Revolution, and I made him mine as well. To orient myself alongside the commander of the American Army in New York, I began at \"the commons,\" now City Hall Park, joining municipal workers on the benches at lunch hour. On July 9, 1776, as British soldiers were gathering on Staten Island and preparing to attack Manhattan, Washington arrayed his troops here and had the newly minted Declaration of Independence read aloud to them. The men were so roused up they charged southward and pulled down the statue of King George at what is now Bowling Green. I hiked down to the same spot and stood there, surrounded by the skyscrapers of the Financial District. Washington was furious at the lack of discipline, but pleased at the men’s ardor. The cheery mood of the troops ended abruptly. Walking a few blocks westward gave me a view of the Hudson River, where Washington was able to join the rest of the shocked town in observing two British warships race up the river with their guns blasting, sending cannonballs careering into the streets. It was a test of the American defenses; they failed. In truth, it was a harrowing situation for the would-be nation, and Washington was frankly uncertain of his ability. His military record was mixed, and most of his service had come two decades earlier, in the French and Indian War. Much of what he had learned of military leadership had been from a book. He was 44, burning with ambition but saddled with an inferiority complex due to his lack of formal education. He was learning on the fly. While he was trying to perform the impossible task of defending miles of shoreline, an odd diplomatic comedy ensued. The British wanted to negotiate, and officers arrived bearing letters intended for Washington. But the letters did not give the American commander his proper title. Washington knew how important protocol was, and refused to accept them. Then another letter arrived. Surprisingly, it was not addressed to Washington, but to a Miss Margaret Moncrieffe. She was the daughter of Major Thomas Moncrieffe, who had chosen to side with the British. The father was now on Staten Island, but Margaret was trapped behind enemy lines — i.e., in New York with the Americans — and Major Moncrieffe wanted Washington to deliver her over to him. I chose young Margaret Moncrieffe as one of my subjects in part because of this slender connection to Washington, in part because of the vibrancy of her personality, but most of all because as her life unfolded I saw her as embodying one aspect of the wider yearning for freedom that America’s Revolution was a part of: the desire of women for some measure of independence. In the summer of 1776, Margaret was only 14, but she was about to reveal her nature by standing up to the most powerful man in America. Washington likely had no idea who this girl was when the letter arrived, but he soon found out. While standing in the little grassy teardrop of Bowling Green, I focused on one of the office buildings before me, 1 Broadway, and held up over it an engraving of the structure that had once stood on or about this same spot. That building had served as the American military headquarters. Here, in the midst of preparations for war, and following the collapse of peace negotiations, Washington hosted a formal dinner. A toast was offered to the Continental Congress, the gathering of representatives from the 13 colonies in Philadelphia. General Washington noticed that the girl at the table did not raise her glass. Margaret Moncrieffe had been invited to join the American officers while they decided what to do with her. Despite having partly grown up in the city, Margaret followed her father’s loyalties and, like thousands of other New Yorkers, was rooting for the British. She now scandalized the gathering and personally affronted Washington by offering a counter toast, to Gen. William Howe, Washington’s opposite on the British side. For a moment, the reserved and deeply formal commander of American forces faced off with an impudent and headstrong teenager. Then Washington ended the standoff with a bit of levity, promising to find a way to send the girl to her father on Staten Island, and asking that once there she offer a toast to the American commanders. Since the building at the foot of Manhattan was alive with military secrets, and seeing as this girl was both observant and openly disposed toward the enemy, Washington thought it prudent to send her away until arrangements could be made to transfer her to the British. She found herself shipped to one of the many fortifications the Americans had constructed, at Kingsbridge, in the Bronx, just opposite the northern tip of Manhattan. I went there too. From the 231st Street subway it was a steady uphill hike. The fort is gone, of course. In place of farms and military outposts I found Chinese takeouts and check-cashing outlets. Then I was met by a steep set of stairs — a step-street — flanked by a Kingsbridge Heights community art project: two painted trees. I climbed the trees — that is, I marched to the top of the steps. Up here, wedged between three avenues — Sedgewick, Reservoir and Webb — lies a scallop of a playground and a weedy strip of park. Part of it, emerging from an outcropping of schist, is called Washington’s Walk. There’s a plaque marking this as the location of one of the American defensive posts. Looking up from the plaque, I saw why the spot was chosen. You’re high up. The expanse of sky is a surprise. Down below, the Jerome Park Reservoir, though man-made in 1906 and bound by land, reminds you of what these forts were for: monitoring the rivers for signs of the British Navy. Here young Margaret was meant to wait until diplomats could arrange for her to be reunited with her father. And here, improbably, she fell in love. None other than Aaron Burr, who at age 21 was already known as a ladies man, was stationed at Kingsbridge. The two young people apparently managed to find some time alone amid the soldiers and the gathering chaos, for Margaret later declared that Burr \"subdued my virgin heart.\" As a result, suddenly, she changed her mind. She had been desperate to reach her father, but now she didn’t want to leave Burr. But the two enemy commands had made their arrangements. Against her will, she was rowed out into the Hudson River and southward, toward Staten Island. I followed her, on the Staten Island Ferry. When we were somewhere in the Upper Bay — past Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, the choppy green-brown water below as somber as death — I imagined the scene of her wobbly transfer from an American to a British boat, as two armies that were about to engage in a world-historic conflict paused to do this small human thing. From the terminal on Staten Island I marched uphill to Tompkinsville Park, which I understood roughly marked the place where the British Navy gathered as General Howe prepared to attack. It was a windswept little triangle of urban greenery, hemmed in by traffic, but with a bit of wandering I was able to get a view down onto the bay, which would have been crowded with naval vessels flying the British flag. Those ships, 400 of them, were now fully occupying Washington’s mind. Where would Howe choose to strike? With no way of knowing, Washington strung his men out in a long, skinny line across six miles of Brooklyn and Manhattan shoreline. Then Howe moved: On Aug. 22, 22,000 British soldiers crossed from Staten Island more or less where the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge stands, hit the beach at Gravesend Bay in Brooklyn and began decimating the American forces. Washington stayed on Manhattan for a time, believing Howe would launch another strike there. Then from the East River shore he saw the signal lights of his men on Brooklyn Heights indicating that the whole British force was enveloping Brooklyn. He crossed the river. Cobble Hill is now the name of a neighborhood, but in the 18th century it was an actual hill. The Americans had built a fort atop it, and from here Washington oversaw the action to the south. The former bank building at Atlantic Avenue and Court Street sits where the hill stood. My plan was to get to the roof and give myself the same view Washington had. But the manager of the Trader Joe’s that now occupies the building informed me that the staircase to the roof was unsafe. I tried piecing together Washington’s view of the Battle of Brooklyn (which is also known as the Battle of Long Island) from the upper floors of the YMCA on Atlantic Avenue and the roof of a nearby apartment building. But that wasn’t very satisfying, so I ended up plunging into the battle. I marched down Smith Street, past hipster lounges, juice bars and bagel shops, past Carroll Street with its little front gardens, and turned left on Third Street. The neighborhood became industrial, which somehow seemed more suitable for mentally recreating a battlefield. Crossing the Gowanus Canal, which then was a creek, I reached the center of the fighting. With the American forces in disarray, Gen. William Alexander made a stand here, in front of the stone farmhouse of Nicholas Vechte, leading a Maryland regiment in a furious counterattack that bought time for much of Washington’s bedraggled army to retreat to Brooklyn Heights. Imagining the fight was made immensely more satisfying by virtue of the fact that the Old Stone House, a reconstruction of Vechte’s farmhouse, stands snugly in the middle of Washington Park, at Third Street between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Parts of the original Dutch house, around which the fighting took place, were used in the 1933 reconstruction, and the building was moved across the park from where it originally stood, but it’s still as evocative of the period as it is anomalous in the neighborhood. Even better, inside, the new permanent exhibition, which went up in 2016, is packed with interpretive displays. Most useful to me was a three-dimensional diorama that shows Brooklyn in its original hilly state. Even more challenging for me than mentally deleting the brownstones and office buildings from the landscape was appreciating its geography. The diorama makes clear why Washington decided to deploy his smaller army as he did, along a series of steep hills that ran between present-day Fulton Street and Eastern Parkway and south to Greenwood Heights. (Later I gave myself another sense of the original terrain by hiking the hills of Green-Wood Cemetery.) The Americans protected the passes between the hills, but the British found that the Jamaica Pass was unguarded and swarmed through. Washington then executed one of the most brilliant maneuvers of the war, using fog and the cover of darkness to get 9,000 soldiers safely across the East River to Manhattan. I mirrored their retreat, taking the ferry from Pier Six to Wall Street, on what turned out to be an appropriately heavy, gray morning. The escape of the American Army stunned the British, and Howe, the victor in the battle, took his time regrouping and planning how he would conquer the city and finish off Washington’s army. Washington, on the run, guessed that Howe would attack either in the south, directly on New York itself, or to the north, at Harlem. He placed an army at Corlears Hook, just north of the city, and chose the mansion of Roger Morris, a wealthy loyalist who had earlier fled the city, as his military headquarters. From here he studied maps, held court-martials and scanned the river below. The Morris-Jumel Mansion still exists, near West 160th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, and as a museum maintains its 18th-century decorum. Its revolutionary vibe was enough to draw, among others, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who lives in the same Washington Heights neighborhood; its operators allowed him to write part of \"Hamilton\" in the mansion. From here, on Sept. 15, Washington heard cannon fire that told him his guesses at where Howe would attack were wrong. The explosions were coming from the south, as 9,000 men landed at Kips Bay, near where the United Nations now sits. The redcoats stormed across Manhattan. Washington fought a brilliant battle at Harlem Heights, but Howe took New York City. Washington’s army retreated up the Hudson River, and eventually into New Jersey. Once the British had control of New York, the little city of 4,000 or so houses became, in effect, two cities: a place of stench and squalor, which had already endured much, and a genteel quarter that the British officers reserved for themselves and their families. Thus Margaret Moncrieffe made a triumphant return, and lived for a time in the center of Loyalist America. She attended the theater and danced at balls with officers, feeling for a short while that she had bested the great but stern American general with whom she had clashed. Washington was shaken to his core by the loss of New York, writing to his cousin, \"If I were to wish the bitterest curse to an enemy on this side of the grave, I should put him in my stead with my feelings.\" But war, like life, involves many twists. Despite what both sides thought, the loss of New York would not mean the end of American resolve. Washington’s side would win, and he would achieve all the honor he craved and more. Young Margaret Moncrieffe would turn out to back the losing army, and the rest of her tumultuous and ultimately tragic life, in which she would continue to defy powerful men, would unfold in Europe. I ended my search for these two personalities of 18th-century America back at 1 Broadway, in the lobby of the building, pondering the unlikely moment they came dramatically into contact with one another. And pondering, too, the many ways that New York has been, and still is, the heart of America.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/travel/new-york-city-american-revolution.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Vince Gill Loves All Kinds of Guitars (and Mountains)', 'text': ' \"I’m just an overgrown cheerleader for cool, old guitars,\" said Vince Gill, the Grammy-winning country star and songwriter. \"They shaped my life. They’re my DNA. They’re my whole reason for making me want to be musical.\" That passion led Mr. Gill to join the new Songbird Guitar Museum as ambassador, which primarily involves helping bring attention to the museum. Tucked into the Chattanooga Choo Choo complex in the southern Tennessee city, the museum houses a massive collection of rare and vintage guitars that showcases the evolution of the instrument. \"It’s fun to be around other people who are that interested in guitars,\" Mr. Gill said. \"They’re just like art, but they make a joyful noise. When something can be that beautiful and entice you to write a song, it’s game over for me.\" Below are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Gill. Tell me what you like about the Songbird Guitar Museum.  It was a private collection and no one really knew about it. The [anonymous] gentleman that started it has been amassing it for twenty years. It’s just stunning. It’s all really top-notch, high-quality instruments. They’re instruments that shaped our musical history. They have prototypes of great Fenders. They have the custom colors that Gibson did every once in a while. They were like a great paint job on an old car. They have a D45, which is considered the holy grail of acoustic guitars. There are some that are so rare it’s just something to see. Why Chattanooga? It is an out-of-the-way place. But this area of the world is pretty historic. Country and blues has deep roots in this whole region. And it’s where the guy lives that acquired the collection. It’s neat that he’s willing to share and doing something for the community. I think there are a lot of great museums in places you wouldn’t expect. There’s the National Music Museum in South Dakota. And there’s a new one in Nashville at Belmont University [the Gallery of Iconic Guitars]. What are some of your other favorite museums?  I’m not really the museum type. Unfortunately. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland is pretty cool. I was just in my hometown, Oklahoma City, and they have a cowboy museum [National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum] that was interesting. Here in Nashville we’ve got the Frist museum, which is wonderful. It’s a funky little thing. The Country Music Hall of Fame is my absolute favorite. I’m so astounded by what they’ve accomplished there. They just made it free for all kids under 18. It has a big education component to it. It’s a beautiful space. Nashville is home for you. What are some of your other favorite spots there?  I go to eat breakfast at the same place every morning. It’s called Noshville. Everyone’s on a first-name basis. It’s \"Cheers\" with a side of eggs. Do you have favorite restaurants when you’re on the road?  I’m a pizza nut. If I go to New York all I eat is pizza. The first job I ever had was making pizza as a kid. I don’t eat it much around here, but when I go to New York I’ll have it for breakfast and dinner. In Oklahoma City, I go to Ted’s Escondido. It’s about my favorite Mexican meal. You travel a lot for your tours. What’s the best and worst part of working the road?  The best part is that you’re knocking around on a bus with your friends. You’re laughing a lot. You’re playing music every night. It’s completely intoxicating. There’s nothing better. The downside is your family life. You don’t get to have as much time with them as you’d like. But no whining allowed. Where are your favorite places to perform?  There’s Red Rocks in Colorado. It’s one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever played music. The Gorge in Washington State is a magnificent place. I’ve gotten to play Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall. I’ve played a few ballparks over the years: Wrigley Field, Comiskey Park and Dodger Stadium. The Troubadour in Los Angeles is a historic place where a lot of people got started — James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt. It was neat to play there 30 or 40 years later. It’s nice when something holds a great memory for you — a place, a friend. Every Monday night I play in a 10-piece band, the Time Jumpers, at 3rd and Lindsley [in Nashville]. It’s fun when you can be part of a place that’s a destination. But our Ryman Auditorium is probably my favorite place to play. There’s something magical about how music sounds in that place. It’s a tabernacle. [Mr. Gill and Ms. Grant play a series of \"Christmas at the Ryman\" concerts in November and December.] Where would you like to go again? I played at a cowboy bar in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for a few weeks when I was 18 or 19. I went out on the river. That mountain climate was magical. About two years ago Amy [Grant, Mr. Gill’s wife] and I went back and spent four or five days there. I went back to the bar, bought a T-shirt and told him I played here in 1976.

Rules of the road, manual versus automatic, even permitted blood alcohol levels — not to mention the necessity of car insurance — can vary widely by country. Here are five useful tips for staying safe. Figure Out Your Insurance Coverage Needs Don’t leave a decision on insurance coverage to a few panicky moments at the rental desk. Check your coverage in advance: In many instances, the credit card you use to book the car will provide ample coverage (very generally, you will still probably need to get liability), and if you have auto insurance at home you might be covered through that as well. Get the policy in writing, not over the phone, and keep it with you throughout your trip. Know the Rules of the Road Driving on the left side of the road may be the biggest consideration, but keep in mind that other countries have rules of the road that are less obvious. In some, for example, you can’t turn right on red and in others, the slow lane can’t be used for passing. Read up before you go to avoid a surprise fine. Consider an International Driving Permit Happily, it’s much less common to be asked for an International Driving Permit than it used to be; these permits cost $20 and remain valid for only a year. Check with your rental agency before leaving your country just in case. If you need one, you can get it through AAA (American Automobile Association) and AATA (American Automobile Touring Alliance). Need an Automatic? Book in Advance In many countries (though fewer than in previous eras), a car with a manual transmission is the default rental. If you aren’t comfortable driving a stick-shift, it’s wise to reserve an automatic well in advance, as agencies usually stock fewer of these. It is also likely to cost more. Know Your Limit Permitted blood alcohol concentration levels are different in each country and even in the European Union there is no single rule: Hungary, for example, has a zero-tolerance policy while Italy’s limit is .5 grams per one liter of blood. Know the limit at your destination before embarking on a wine tour or having a beer with lunch.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/travel/car-rental-abroad-tips.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'At an Opulent Hong Kong Hotel, Room to Roam', 'text': ' From about 1,755 Hong Kong dollars (or about $225, at 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to the dollar) Opened last year, the 32-room Olympian Hong Kong offers a rare amenity in one of the densest, most property-crunched cities in the world: breathing space. An enormous five-tiered chandelier, elegant wingback chairs, and overflowing bouquets of (very realistic) fake flowers — complete with customized scent — adorn the serene, marble-clad entrance lobby; hotel guests go up an escalator for check-in with a dedicated \"guest ambassador.\" All rooms are on the second floor of the One Silversea private residence building, with cushy seating areas overlooking the lobby. This is clubby, apartment-style living for less, made possible with a quieter location just off the beaten path. West Kowloon, on the water with tree-framed views of the Kowloon skyline anchored by the distinctive 118-floor International Commerce Center tower, known for having a rooftop sky bar that’s the tallest in the world (it’s so tall that it’s often shrouded in clouds). Across a pedestrian footbridge from the hotel is the Olympian City mall and the Olympic MTR subway station, with easy access to Kowloon and Central stations. It’s also close to the glittering shopping bazaar of Tsim Sha Tsui, and convenient to the China-Macau Ferry Terminal and to the airport by train or taxi. Massive and opulent, with 11-foot ceilings, lacquered-wood sliding doors and gold-accented everything, from the bird-sculpture art pieces to the blackout curtains. Our room, in the lowest \"deluxe\" category, was more of a suite: 463 square feet with floor-to-ceiling windows and a city view. Just off the hallway from the front door is a kitchenette, with full-size fridge, pantry space, microwave, Nespresso machine and teakettle. Down the hallway is an enormous bathroom, a separate living room with a couch and table, and the bedroom. Sadly, the generous wraparound outdoor patio is not accessible to hotel guests because of the upper-floor residences. Our host, Yoyo, told us that housekeeping has found cigarette butts and eggs — \"you know, like a sunny-side up egg?\"—on the deck, tossed out by residents above. The bathroom alone is the size of a Manhattan studio. But it actually contains multiple rooms: a toilet (with telephone), a massive glass-doored rainhead shower room that might as well have its own ecosystem, and a separate spa tub with headrest. Each room has a complimentary smartphone for you to use out on the town, with free calls and Wi-Fi — it comes preloaded with helpful features like maps, city guides, shopping and ticket discounts, currency calculators, and a local phone number for people to reach you. There’s also a fitness center, and a laundry room for guest use — extremely rare in Hong Kong, and tremendously useful for those staying longer than a week. The hotel also offers Rolls-Royce limousine service (for roughly double the price of a taxi). A 24-hour private lounge serves complimentary drinks and snacks. There’s also room service, offering an all-day menu of items including soy-sauce chicken wings (88 Hong Kong dollars), spaghetti Bolognese (108 Hong Kong dollars), and grilled minced beef and potato (88 Hong Kong dollars). But you’re in Hong Kong — and Kowloon has some of the best eating districts in Hong Kong — so the street is really your restaurant. Room-to-roam apartment-style living in a city where space is at a serious premium. Convenient to the airport and Kowloon’s attractions, it’s a luxuriant, calm oasis amid the Hong Kong hubbub, and surprisingly affordable.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/travel/olympian-hong-kong-hotel.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The Travel Podcast Comes Into Its Own', 'text': ' In a commissioned episode, Nate DiMeo, creator of the podcast the Memory Palace, invites guests of the Freepoint Hotel in Cambridge, Mass., to cross the street and wander around Fresh Pond while he tells a story. It’s a dreamy story that reaches well into the pond’s past in the 19th century when the entrepreneur Frederic Tudor managed to create an empire in the ice trade, shipping frozen blocks from the pond to distant, sweltering climes. The ice found its way into \"the drinks of Maharajahs, of men and women in waterfront bars in midsummer in Martinique,\" he says, over soft music that mixes in sounds referencing the industry and export geography. \"He had turned pond water into a luxury item.\" The 14-minute recording, available free from the hotel, represents the vanguard of engagement in the travel realm long saturated in the written word for practical advice and increasingly reliant on video to provide a you-are-there simulation. For travelers in situ — versus armchair travelers — listening can stimulate the imagination to make the leap from present to past. \"People like finding things,\" said Dave McCaslin, the executive vice president of H.H.M., which owns the Freepoint and worked on its podcast portfolio available on RadioPublic, a mobile app for podcasts. It also includes a fitness channel with an episode on the Boston Marathon and a bedtime channel featuring relaxing jazz music and a discussion of how dreams work. In the Memory Palace commission, \"We wanted something hyper local that people can’t really get anywhere. The ideal is to experience something that isn’t canned.\" Taking travel to another dimension — in a way that may encourage positive reviews and build a brand — is the goal of many podcasts now proliferating across the web, and mostly free to access. The Carlyle, a Rosewood Hotel in New York is launching a podcast in January featuring interviews with celebrity guests in advance of the 2018 movie Always at the Carlyle on the subject. The Detroit Foundation Hotel, opened last spring, houses a podcast studio where Hillary Sawchuk, the host of A Drink With podcasts, has interviewed Detroit personalities, entrepreneurs and artists, sessions that are available on the hotel website. In its first episode released in October, the new travel podcast Unmapped offers the aural travel diary, complete with bumps in the road, of the blogger Angelina Zeppieri. In an age when virtually every smartphone has a voice recorder, podcasting is a cost-effective medium, which could help explain its surge in listeners. In its 2017 report, Edison Research, which tracks digital audio and podcast consumption among other new media, found that 40 percent of Americans over the age of 12 have listened to a podcast, and 24 percent have listened to one in the prior month, up 21 percent versus the year before. Six in 10 respondents said they were familiar with the term \"podcasting,\" a 22 percent increase over two years. When it launched its World Nomads Podcast earlier this year, the travel insurance company World Nomads spent less than $4,000 to construct a professional recording studio. The podcast, which has covered topics that include how small towns in Croatia are being overrun by tourists, costs under $200 a month to edit and $20 for podcast hosting. \"There will always be a place for a few friends sitting around a kitchen table with a USB microphone and a laptop, as long as they talk about interesting stuff. It’s the wonderfully democratized end of broadcasting,\" wrote Phil Sylvester, the communications manager for World Nomads, in an email. Podcasting, of course, isn’t new. In the world of downloads, there are lots of prescriptive podcasts, from tips on how to travel more on a tight budget (Extra Pack of Peanuts) to touring by motorcycle (Adventure Rider Radio). The host Chris Christensen has offered destination advice via interviews in more than 580 episodes of Amateur Traveler since launching in 2005. Traditional media, including Condé Nast Traveler magazine (Travelogue), The Associated Press (Get Outta Here) and Frommers.com (Frommers.com Podcast), also publish podcasts. There are location-specific podcasts such as Londonist Out Loud and others devoted to forms of travel like the RV Family Travel Atlas. This Week in Travel explores current events and No Vacancy with Glenn Haussman focuses on the travel business. Travel-related companies are hopping onto the podcast platform as a millennial marketing tool. In addition to publishing a travel magazine, the luggage company Away has a podcast, Airplane Mode, that explores \"the reasons we travel and places we find ourselves.\" A recent episode covered \"narrow brushes with danger, souvenirs with a back story, and trips that end in unexpected situations.\" Among newcomers putting story ahead of service, hotels have been especially active in the podcast arena; some of the best have used the contemporary medium to explore the past. Originally opened as a men’s sports club in 1893, the Chicago Athletic Association hotel has used its Storytelling Series of live interviews as a way to examine the history of the building and the culture of Chicago. With many episodes newly available on iTunes, the series includes conversations with a Great Lakes surfer and local artists and musicians. Some audio tours have also taken a more sound-rich approach to storytelling, including a new series that Mr. DiMeo of the Memory Palace did at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. As an artist in residence, he produced eight compelling recordings available on the museum’s website that provide the back stories on objects ranging from early American portrait paintings to the Egyptian Temple of Dendur. There’s even a scavenger hunt that includes directions to \"find me a picture of a child and wonder for a moment who she or he grew to be.\" The audio tour company Detour has used film and television producers to capture and mix place-specific sounds on its walking tours, now available in 17 cities. Most are narrated by experts and figures associated with the locales, including the documentarian Ken Burns on the Brooklyn Bridge tour, the comedian Jenny Zigrino on a pub crawl around Faneuil Hall in Boston to taverns associated with Revolutionary War plotting, and the novelist George Dawes Green, also the founder of the Moth storytelling series, on the squares of Savannah (most downloads cost $7.99). \"The technology allows you to have an immersive experience,\" said Stacey Book, the director of content for Detour. \"You get something unique from someone speaking who you wouldn’t have access to.\" Professionally mixed sound and scoring enrich the stories and help create Detour’s aural landscapes. As Ms. Book said, \"You can shoot a blank wall and still have an interesting story to tell with audio.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/travel/travel-podcasts.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'What You Need to Know About the New ID Law and Travel', 'text': ' In the past several months, there has been plenty of conversation about the Real ID Act and how it will affect air travelers. Passed by Congress in 2005, the act is intended to prevent identity fraud, and starting on Jan. 22, 2018, fliers who reside in some states, even if they’re flying domestically, will need identification other than a driver’s license to pass through Transportation Security Administration security checkpoints at airports. Who exactly is affected and what additional identification will the T.S.A. require? Here, answers to questions about what the Real ID Act means for travelers and why having a passport now may be more important than ever. What exactly is the Real ID Act? The act is meant to ensure that a person presenting an ID is in fact who that person says they are, according to Justine Whelan, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security. \"The act prevents the production of fake IDs and ensures that all identification that is used has certain features which prevent tampering or are difficult to replicate,\" Ms. Whelan said. These features include anti-counterfeit technology, such as the holograms on some state licenses. Federally issued documents, such as a passport, also fall into the difficult-to-replicate category. Why is the act being implemented? Congress passed the act on the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission that the federal government set minimum security standards for how states issue identification and for how that identification is used. \"These security standards ensure a safer American public. At the end of the day, everyone should be who they say they are,\" Ms. Whelan said. When does it go into effect and for which states? Ms. Whelan said that Real ID enforcement has been implemented in phases over the last two years in some states. If you show up to a federal facility such as a military base, for example, and you live in a state that’s not Real ID compliant, you will need alternative identification to a driver’s license. Currently, 28 states are Real ID compliant, including Texas, Ohio, Florida, Nevada and Colorado. For a complete list, visit dhs.gov/real-id. But what does the Real ID Act mean for air travelers?  Starting Jan. 22, 2018, the T.S.A. will ask all travelers who don’t have a driver’s license from a compliant state or a state that has been granted an extension to the compliance deadline (this means that residents can continue using their noncompliant license for federal purposes while the state continues working to be in compliance) to provide an alternative form of acceptable identification. Travelers won’t be able to pass through security without this acceptable identification. And, as of Oct. 1, 2020, all air travelers will be required to have a Real ID-compliant driver’s license or alternate acceptable identification to fly domestically. What exactly qualifies as acceptable identification? The D.H.S. has designated more than a dozen forms of acceptable ID including a passport; a border ID card; a trusted traveler card, such as Global Entry; a Real ID compliant driver’s license; and a permanent resident card. For a complete list, visit tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification. Is one form of acceptable identification better than another? Ms. Whelan said that the D.H.S. does not advocate any particular form of acceptable identification, but Brenda Sprague, who oversees passport services for the U.S. Department of State, said that, with the implementation of Real ID fast approaching, residents who live in states that aren’t Real ID compliant should apply for a passport before the end of the year. November and December are the best months to apply for or renew your current passport, Ms. Sprague said, because the turnaround time to get a new passport now is usually around four weeks. In the summer, when passport applications peak, the wait for a new passport could be up to eight weeks. Around 136 million Americans have passports in circulation, according to State Department — that’s only around 40 percent of the population in the United States. O.K., you’ve convinced me, and I’m ready to apply for a new passport. What’s the best way? Ms. Sprague said that there are more than 8,000 passport application locations around the country. Around 60 percent are post offices while the rest are courthouses and libraries. Visit the Department of State’s Where to Apply link for more details. In addition, there are 27 passport agencies, where travelers can apply for rush passports. \"These agencies are for people who are traveling within two weeks,\" Ms. Sprague said. This link has a list of these agencies; applicants need an appointment for a visit and can make one online at passportappointment.travel.state.gov. Also, the State Department is collaborating with Hilton Hotels & Resorts on the Hilton Passport Project, an initiative meant to encourage more Americans to apply for passports. Every few weeks, a Hilton location in the United States will have a Passport Concierge booth, where guests and the general public can have their passport pictures taken for free and apply for or renew a passport. Between one and three employees from the State Department will be on hand to answer passport-related questions and help fill out applications. The next Passport Concierge will be at Hilton Cleveland Downtown from Nov. 9 to 11. For a list of coming locations, visit facebook.com/Hilton. How much does it cost to get a new passport? First-time applicants pay $110 plus a $25 application fee. Passport renewals cost $110 and expedited passports are an additional $60. If you’re renewing your passport, you can do it by mail, but if you’re getting a new passport or if your existing one is lost or stolen, you must apply in person.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/travel/realid-air-travel-identification.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '', 'text': '', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/travel/five-places-to-go-in-san-francisco-bayview.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Charlie Chaplin, at Home in Switzerland', 'text': ' Charlie Chaplin appeared in more than 80 films over the course of his roughly 75-year career. But I had to travel to Switzerland to see this one from the 1960s: A home movie in which the silent film star, white-haired and in his 70s, skips playfully on the front lawn of his estate, holding hands with two of his young children. The black-and-white scene jumps to the great comedian dining with several of his brood, each spooning soup in comic unison, then to Chaplin, wide-eyed, a hat levitating magically above his head to the family’s delight. He is rounder than his film character, the Little Tramp, but he remains impish, a child among his own children. That is the personal portrait that emerges from Chaplin’s last home, the 37-acre estate, Manoir de Ban, in the small Swiss Riviera town of Corsier-sur-Vevey, about 55 miles northeast of Geneva, where he lived from 1953 until his death in 1977. Restored and refashioned into a museum last spring, it is part of the new complex on the grounds known as Chaplin’s World that includes an immersive cinema museum devoted to his professional achievements, and a restaurant that serves fish and chips in a nod to his London boyhood. It seems fitting that Chaplin, a perfectionist and multi-tasker, chose Switzerland, a country famous for precision in everything from luxury watches to Roger Federer’s backhand, as his retirement home. \"A friend suggested Switzerland,\" he wrote opaquely in his 1964 memoir, \"My Autobiography.\" On an ocean liner bound for Europe with his family in 1952, Chaplin learned he was prohibited from returning to his home in the United States without submitting to an interrogation regarding his politics and morals. For several years prior, the F.B.I. and the House Un-American Activities Committee had been investigating his links to Communism — \"I am a peace-monger,\" he told them — during the Hollywood purge of 1947. In his 2014 book, \"Charlie Chaplin,\" the author Peter Ackroyd suggests the star was attracted by the lenient Swiss tax code. Or, perhaps, like generations before him, he had come for the peace and quiet. By the 18th century, Lac Léman, a.k.a. Lake Geneva, was already a haven for travelers who found respite between their tours of the great European capitals in slow walks along the shore, especially the 19-mile stretch between Lausanne and Montreux known as the Swiss Riviera. In the early 20th century, Clinique La Prairie spa began dispensing rejuvenating treatments here, and the wealthy continued to spend seasons in formal lakefront hotels, as captured in the late Anita Brookner’s \"Hotel du Lac,\" a quiet 1984 novel set in today’s Grand Hotel du Lac in Vevey. The snow-capped Alps of France and Switzerland that rose up beyond the far shore of the placid lake provided the mountainous backdrop that Chaplin could see from his front yard at Manoir de Ban, a 13-minute uphill bus ride from lakeside Vevey. A film fan, I had long been interested in Chaplin the artist — the comic genius and cinematic innovator who worked on both sides of the camera. That’s the subject of the Studio film museum in Chaplin’s World, while the Chaplin mansion, where I started my visit, explores his personal life. Nearly leaping, a lifelike wax figure of a waving Chaplin greeted me in the foyer. The neoclassical home’s first floor has been faithfully restored as it appeared in Chaplin’s day down to the family furniture, including the cozy, jacquard-print sofa on which I was invited to sit in the ornate living room. \"We think we are not precisely a museum, but we haven’t found the word for it yet,\" said Annick Barbezat, the communications director for Chaplin’s World, as she guided me on a summer visit. \"People say, ‘It’s dangerous to sit on the sofa. It could stain.’ We counter, ‘We’ll wash it and put it back.’\" Chaplin served as an actor, writer, director and composer on many of his films, and original scores, letters and scripts lie on his desk as if he’d just left the room. \"Chaplin had a lifelong compulsion to do everything himself, even down to wanting to play every role in each of his films,\" wrote the film critic and author David Robinson in the forward to \"My Autobiography.\" He was also scandal-prone, as related in a library wallpapered in newspaper clippings of Chaplin’s controversies, including allegations of tax evasion and, more damning, affairs with young women, some only teenagers when they met Chaplin and starred in his films. Somewhat incongruently, a wax figure of his friend Winston Churchill presides in this room, one of a series of celebrity references in the house reminding visitors of the breadth of Chaplin’s worldwide fame in the early 20th century. Black-and-white photos of past overnight guests, ranging from Salvador Dalí to Sophia Loren, fill one former bedroom. But the most moving rooms attest to the private man. In a former bedroom, the home movies made by his fourth and last wife, Oona, show a joyful Chaplin waltzing with one of his children – he had eight with Oona, 36 years his junior — in his arms, or lying on the floor mimicking the thumb-sucking infant beside him. If the house embodies the personal Chaplin, the separate Studio film museum on the grounds is the true attraction for cinephiles, featuring an immersive journey through his career via a series of sound-stage-style rooms. Each conjures one of his most famous films with wax figures, props and looping clips. A baleful Jackie Coogan, namesake of \"The Kid,\" anchors a cobblestone street corner in the opening set. A laughing Paulette Goddard holds a bunch of bananas as in \"Modern Times\" with the film running behind her. A fan and friend, Michael Jackson is also here in an exhibit suggesting Chaplin’s dance moves in \"Modern Times\" inspired the singer’s signature moonwalk. With the exception of a static room devoted to the most valuable artifacts, such as Chaplin’s trademark bowler hat and cane and his Oscar statues, the Studio encourages playful interaction. During my visit, visitors took selfies in a barber shop chair on \"The Great Dictator\" set. In a reproduction of the Yukon cabin, poised on a fulcrum, used in the 1925 film \"The Gold Rush,\" I shuffled side to side to tilt the set as it had done in the movie. \"Chaplin said, ‘If you want to know me, see my movies,’\" Ms. Barbezat said. \"You can read his humanity in movies like ‘The Great Dictator’ and ‘The Kid.’ We hope to do what he did. He made people think and feel.\" On the Swiss Riviera, Chaplin’s world isn’t limited to Chaplin’s World. Just beyond his estate, the new Modern Times Hotel salutes the Little Tramp with film clips in the lobby and Chaplin portraits throughout the bar and guestrooms. In Vevey, where, according to home movies, Oona pushed the wheelchair-bound Chaplin late in life along the lakefront path, a bronze statue of the diminutive Little Tramp gazes wistfully over the lake, posing for tourist photos. Though the family maintains tight control of Chaplin’s image — for example, the only place to buy a postcard depicting him hereabouts is at the Chaplin’s World gift shop — several sites in Vevey pay homage to him, including most notably the Läderach chocolate shop. Almost 20 years ago, its chief chocolatier, Blaise Poyet, approached the family about making a confection in Chaplin’s honor. He modeled it on the Little Tramp’s oversize shoes and rendered them in chocolate. \"They have three characteristics based on Charlie,\" said Mr. Poyet, seated in the shop’s kitchen. \"First, he was strong, hard. So I use dark chocolate. Second, he was very romantic, and for that I use caramel. And third, he was original, so I use pine nuts, which is unusual.\" A cafe down the street bears his French pet name, Le Charlot, and a women’s shop had a window decorated with a bowler hat, cane, red rose and a number of film stills that harmonized with the vintage-inspired dresses on sale. \"It’s a homage to the museum,\" said a sales clerk. \"He was a romantic.\" My own Chaplin-esque — which is to say mischievous — moment occurred on the lakefront terrace of the aristocratic Hotel des Trois Couronnes in Vevey when I put a 20 Swiss franc bill down on an overpriced 10-franc beer and pocketed the unfamiliar change, only to discover later that the waiter had exchanged it for smaller notes and not deducted the tab. Immoral or lucky? I knew Chaplin’s answer. Like the Little Tramp, who often ended his films by tottering down the road, he’d mentally twirl a cane and wobble lakeward into the sunset.

Why can’t they turn the page? Your article answered its own question. After a generation of blatant Clinton dissembling (from his \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman\" to her answer to the question on whether she had wiped her computers clean — \"Like with a cloth or something?\"), the voters were driven almost mad with thirst for any drop of authenticity and, hearing none from Hillary, decided that Trump’s blurting whatever was on his mind was as close as they would get. This fact, \"unacknowledged\" as you say, even after Donna Brazile blew the curtains aside, disheartens Democrats still. We will not be motivated to focus on the essential quality of candor until we acknowledge that our last candidate had none of it. Bruce A. McAllister, West Palm Beach, Fla. Here we go again: The Democrats overthinking, overanalyzing, bickering. The leadership focuses inward, worrying about rebranding the party. The alt-right instead focuses outward on building a constituency. It learned long ago that push-button trigger phrases that establish real-world positions for voters are also so attention-grabbing that they are all many voters see and hear. The Democrats must also accept that pulling the country away from extremes and regaining power means offering moderate candidates who fit an image the noncoastal population can be comfortable with; for the president, that means a single, unifying candidate, not the recent debacle in which the party basically shot itself in the foot. Sadly, futuristic ideals must temporarily take a back seat to reunifying this country as a constitutional democracy, not allowing an oligarchy to dismember the Constitution and years of social and environmental progress. Democrats must be in rescue-and-rebuild mode, resuming a progressive agenda only when our democracy has been restabilized. Miriam S. Michel, Jackson Heights, Queens A better deal to create a better party that can more aptly appeal to the purple district sounds great to me. But in my home district (Colorado’s Fourth), people don’t care about a better deal. There is no deal, only total victory. In my time here, I have met very few independents who weigh both candidates equally and look for the best. They see either red or blue, usually red. I wish the Democrats well in the future, but from where I’m sitting, it doesn’t look good. Nick D’Ambrosio, Boulder, Colo. RE: FIRST WORDS Jane Coaston wrote about the conservative movement’s base and its desire for radical change. The voters who \"won\" are the legacy of the Republican Party’s infamous \"Southern strategy.\" Angry and ill informed, infected with blind \"patriotism\" for a Constitution they don’t actually understand and very often religious or racist or both, this crowd, I believe, has always been a solid one-fourth of the American electorate. Only George Wallace and Donald Trump were shameless enough to openly court them; usually it was left to local actors (and the likes of Fox News) to issue the dog whistles and code words that would summon this \"deplorable\" demographic to the polls. These voters have no need, indeed they have no patience, for the intellectual gloss provided by traditional conservative thinkers. The problem for the G.O.P. has been that as its support among the broader population has waned, its primaries have become more and more dominated by this demographic. Trump, armed with a con artist’s willingness to lie openly and shamelessly, easily cashed in on the ignorance and gullibility of what is now the Republican base. James Demers, Brooklyn, on nytimes.com When Coaston says, \"And it was the voters who won,\" I would point out that perhaps 40 percent of the voters won. Those of us who voted against Trump, or didn’t vote at all, have clearly lost. While politics and religion have always been topics to avoid in polite conversation, politics at least used to be something that could be discussed with some measure of objectivity (at least compared with religion, which is all subjective). But now it seems that politics has become the same sort of tribal, instinctual concept that makes religious arguments so futile. When facts become \"alternative\" and the Fourth Estate is labeled \"fake,\" Americans who still want the ability to compromise and govern using logical science- and evidence-based arguments are the ones who have turned into \"radicals.\" Mad Max, on nytimes.com', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/magazine/the-11-05-17-issue.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Is ‘Loyalty’ a Virtue? In the Trump Era, It’s Complicated.', 'text': ' Many of our loftiest ideals — like love, or honesty — seem relatively straightforward until the moment we try to define them and their baffling complexity is revealed. It was in this spirit that the American philosopher Josiah Royce attempted, early in the 20th century, to pin down the true meaning of loyalty. Royce believed loyalty to be the cornerstone of human goodness, the quality that allowed us to rise above individual squabbles and gather together with communal purpose. It required, in his estimation, \"the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause.\" This is an interest the current president may share: Loyalty and devotion are among his most persistent fixations. In his ghostwritten memoir, \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" he valorizes the loyalty of his mentor Roy Cohn and complains indignantly about disloyal people — those who \"think only about what’s best for them and don’t think twice about stabbing a friend in the back if the friend becomes a problem.\" In his remarkable address to the Boy Scouts’ National Jamboree in July, he even singled out this quality from among others in the Scout Law — \"thrifty,\" \"brave,\" \"reverent\" — for special praise: \"We could use some more loyalty,\" he said. \"I will tell you that.\" The cause to which Trump desires such devotion, of course, generally seems to be the success and popularity of Donald Trump. This was clearest during his presidential campaign, when he asked audiences at rallies to raise their right hands and solemnly swear that they would vote for him. At one rally, in Vermont, people were required to profess their support before even being allowed inside. \"I’m taking care of my people, not people who don’t want to vote for me or are undecided,\" he said in a statement. \"They are loyal to me, and I am loyal to them.\" When you ask someone to be loyal to you personally, as Trump does, what you’re concretely requesting is that they choose your cause over other, competing interests. This is what Jesus was describing when he said, \"You cannot serve two masters\" — loyalty is revealed only in conflict, when you have to pick one thing over another. Loyal people aren’t just devoted. Their allegiances are durable — and as a consequence, their options are limited. But Trump himself prefers to keep his options open, and his allegiances can be quite malleable. His tendency to wash his hands of ties is widely noted, running all the way back to the 1980s, when, according to a secretary employed by Cohn — the mentor whose loyalty Trump so praised — Trump responded to Cohn’s learning of his own H.I.V. infection by severing professional ties. Trump’s ideology is just as famously flexible. Sixteen years before he ran for president as a Republican, he nearly ran under the flag of Ross Perot’s Reform Party, telling Larry King that his desired vice-presidential pick was Oprah Winfrey. He may vow to end DACA in one conversation and to work to salvage it in another. There’s no clear pattern to his changing sympathies, which means that when he demands your loyalty, you cannot quite know what it is that you’re signing up for. You can’t even count on his disloyalty: In August, he cashed in a good deal of political capital to extend a pardon to Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz. — partly out of what seemed, to genuinely surprised observers, like an earnest sense of obligation to an ally. If this is a version of loyalty, it’s loyalty of a low order — fragile, transactional and much closer to simple fealty. It fails Royce’s expectation that real loyalty be based in \"willingness,\" rather than in fear. It’s the kind that scaffolds autocratic governments, in which the ruler’s power is always dependent on a network of unstable personal alliances — and all hints of potential disloyalty must be flamboyantly purged. The core contention of Trump’s campaign, oddly enough, was that he was the only loyal candidate in the field — the only one powerful, wealthy and independent enough to act on behalf of the American hoi polloi, rather than in his own interests or those of his donors. \"I didn’t need to do this,\" he told a news conference in Florida, alluding to his already sizable fortune. One ad promised to replace the \"corrupt establishment\" who usually held power \"with a new government controlled by you, the American people.\" There’s an important claim at the heart of this kind of populism — that the failings of government aren’t a problem of policy, but a problem of allegiance. It isn’t that politicians are incapable of improving the lives of ordinary Americans; it’s that they choose not to, because their true interests lie elsewhere. This is the genius of a slogan like \"Make America Great Again,\" with its implication that other politicians have a more noncommittal attitude concerning the nation’s potential greatness. By signaling, over and over, that his loyalties lay somewhere outside the norm, Trump could build an ad hoc coalition of people who felt ill served by the normal political class, for almost any reason at all — an effect only reinforced by every attack on his campaign. When Hillary Clinton referred to many of his supporters as \"deplorables,\" she offered them the gift of a name — along with hard evidence that Trump was, in fact, their only loyal protector, and the only one interested in their opinions and grievances. One of Trump’s inspirations, judging by how often he used to tweet passages from it, is Sun Tzu’s \"The Art of War,\" which contains some instructions about how to maintain such loyalty. \"If soldiers are punished before a personal attachment to the leadership is formed,\" it says, \"they will not submit, and if they do not submit, they are hard to employ.\" When it comes to voters, Trump turns out to have followed this advice quite closely. While promising them, at great length, the rebirth of the coal industry and the instant replacement of Obamacare, he instilled in them an enduring personal attachment. And that bond has allowed him to characterize the incomplete realization of those promises as failures of the political machine he swore to combat, rather than as examples of his own inadequacy. We tend to think of loyalty as a virtue, but the truth is that it can lead to any number of outcomes — from heroism to cravenness and complicity with evil. A lot depends on its object. \"Tell me who you loyal to,\" Kendrick Lamar asks in his song \"Loyalty\": \"Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?\" Loyalty is only a virtue insofar as it provokes virtuous consequences. And yet people have always thought we could use more of it and mourned its passing. More than 100 years ago, as pointed out by the author Eric Felten in his book \"Loyalty: The Vexing Virtue,\" the Irish novelist and politician Justin McCarthy wrote that loyalty \"is gone! It is a memory!\" As far back as 160 B.C., scholars have found, the Roman dramatist Terence was referring to fidelity as belonging solely to more ancient times. We’re prone to imagining some long-gone golden age in which people acted more reliably — and in the service of some agreed-upon collective good. What we’re missing is, perhaps, not the loyalty itself but a communal sense of what we should be loyal to. This, in the end, is what Josiah Royce came to consider the point of loyalty: an attachment to ever-higher ideals, until whole societies could dedicate themselves to some utopian vision that, while never fully realized, might unite citizens in their striving for it. There are shades of this thinking in the title of the coming book by the former F.B.I. director James Comey: \"A Higher Loyalty.\" It’s with Comey, of course, that Trump reportedly made his boldest call for fealty, telling the director, \"I expect loyalty\" — the obvious implication being that Comey should shy away from legal inquiries that might harm the president. Comey testified to the Senate that he made a more Roycean counteroffer: \"honesty.\" Trump, ever the dealmaker, supposedly tried to broker this back to \"honest loyalty.\" The Republican senator Jeff Flake, in a speech announcing that he would not be standing for re-election, reached twice for the same word: A segment of his party, he said, had come to believe that \"anything short of complete and unquestioning loyalty\" to the president was unacceptable. But the president, he said, quoting Theodore Roosevelt, \"should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able and disinterested service to the nation as a whole.\" This, perhaps, is the consequence of a campaign rooted in the lowest forms of loyalty. Trump’s aggressive insistence on transactional, partisan cronyism has clearly inspired, in some quarters, renewed thinking about the purpose and value of loyalty itself. We are seeing, with unsettling clarity, the limits of fidelity to a person, a faction, an agenda. And we are beginning to search for some better place to direct it.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/magazine/is-loyalty-a-virtue-in-the-trump-era-its-complicated.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'New Sentences: From Duolingo’s Italian Lessons', 'text': ' — From Duolingo, a \"science-based language education platform\" available on Apple, Android and Windows smartphones and online. Language-learning sentences are always slightly funny. They exist to teach you linguistically, not to communicate anything about the actual world. They are sentences that are also nonsentences — generic by design, without personality or ambiguity: human language in merely humanoid strings. The subtext is always just \"Here is something a person might say.\" It’s like someone making a window. What matters is that it’s transparent, not what is being seen through it. When James Joyce taught English to Italian speakers in Austria in 1905, he took the opposite approach, torturing his students with elaborate sentences like: \"Dubliners are the most hopeless, useless and inconsistent race of charlatans I have ever come across, on the island or the Continent\" and \"Proverbially and by nature our peasants walk in their sleep, closely resembling fakirs in their froglike and renunciatory sterility.\" If Duolingo, the popular virtual language tutor, offered either of those sentences, people would probably delete the app. \"The animals remain in the zoo\" is a perfect language-learning sentence because it describes, as simply as possible, a totally normal state of affairs. That’s what the animals are supposed to do. It’s like saying: \"The refrigerator continues to be an appliance.\" My wife, who has been studying Italian on her phone, encountered this sentence there, along with hundreds of others like it. She took special notice only when this zoo-animal sentence started to recur, again and again, across many different lessons. Eventually, it lost its linguistic transparency. Was Duolingo trying to tell her something? Was this some kind of code?

The horror that unfolded there is indelible: A single shooter killed at least 58 people and injured hundreds more. And yet the horror is not indelible; it is fading, as most public tragedies eventually do. (You might even have wondered, reading the above, Which events in Las Vegas?) Since Oct. 1, there has been a terrorist attack in New York City, a mass shooting in Texas and other gun violence throughout the country, as well as numerous distressing public scandals. What trace of these events remains for those of us not personally affected by them? Names, dates, photographs, videos: all retrievable, but most archived away in a cloud of faint memory. After mass killings, American newspapers do not typically run images of corpses. The reasons have to do with respect for the dead and concern for readers’ sensitivities, as well as restrictions put on photojournalists’ access to crime scenes (these conventions are subtly, and unjustly, different when it comes to international stories). Instead of photographs of bloody bodies in the street, we get photographs of ambulances, medical professionals, law enforcement, people ducking for cover. A photograph we’ve all seen is of someone in distress being cradled in someone else’s arms. Another is of the candlelit vigils held in the aftermath of these horrors. The raw pathos inherent in such moments is now dulled; seen once too often, the situations are not as moving as they ought to be. But even with these diminishing returns, the press is obligated to run pictures. Among them, which are piercing? Which endure? The minor ones, the odd and peculiar ones, the ones that evoke some other history. The images that have stayed with me from the Las Vegas massacre are of broken glass. Stephen Paddock sprayed bullets down on country-music concertgoers from a suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay resort, smashing two of its windows in order to do so. For photographers arriving after the massacre, it would have made sense to look up and shoot the building (the shared vocabulary between cameras and firearms is both regrettable and illuminating), aiming in the opposite direction to the killer’s nighttime shots. What these photographers would have seen was a golden building, its front part protuberant and vaguely ship-shaped. The hotel’s windows are gaudy in the Vegas style, covered with a thin layer of gold. Near the top of the building are two irregular shapes, nine panels apart, one of them on the building’s prow, the other on its starboard. They look like small black stains or asterisks, or perhaps even like a pair of gouged-out eyes: These are the broken windows. The postmassacre photographs of the building are documents of fact. They do not feel like \"works of art,\" nor are they intended to be. But they have a collective ability to draw our attention to the void behind the broken windows, not only the unilluminated void where windows were broken but also the inhumane void that possessed the murderer’s soul, the mournful void that overtook the survivors and the abysmal void beneath our way of life, from which a bewildering violence erupts incessantly. Glass is everywhere in photography. From Eugène Atget’s reflective vitrines to Lee Friedlander’s sly self-portraiture, photographers have long been in thrall to the visual complications glass can inject into a composition. Glass is present not only as photography’s seductive subject but also as its physical material. Photographs were commonly made on wet-plate negatives (glass coated with photosensitive emulsion) in the 19th century, and then on the improved and portable dry-plate negatives, before film was manufactured at a sufficient strength in the 20th century to serve as a transportable medium for photographic emulsion. Sometimes the very glass of the negative becomes part of the photograph’s story. Andre Kertesz photographed a view over Montmartre in 1929, presumably through an open window. Kertesz left Paris and moved to New York and was not reunited with the negative until the 1960s, by which time it was cracked and badly damaged. But this damage became the story. Looking at Kertesz’s 1970 print of the negative, it’s easy to think that what we are seeing is a photograph of a city through a broken window, perhaps one shot through with a bullet. It is in fact a photograph of a city printed from a damaged glass-plate negative. Broken glass, and broken windows in particular, are a notable byway in photography’s history. Brett Weston made one of the most striking examples in San Francisco in 1937. Weston was not recording evidence of a crime, or even particularly making a sociological comment. He was describing an abstraction with his camera, the calligraphic presence of a jagged black hole surrounded by a gray remnant of glass. What has been broken away dominates the picture. We see an outline like a map of a fictional island. There’s more dark to see here than glass, and the darkness is deep and mysterious, a mouth agape in an unending scream. About this picture, John Szarkowski, the influential curator at the Museum of Modern Art, wrote that the black shape \"is not a void but a presence; the periphery of the picture is background.\" In the middle, in that darkness, is where Weston’s self-portrait would be, if the window were intact. Brett Weston was the son of the great photographer Edward Weston, and he shared his father’s attraction to the mesmerizing abstractions that everyday objects can harbor. But the younger Weston’s unique talent was to balance finely, over a long career, the competing demands of something and nothing, not simply of shape but also of the absence of shape, and to create strongly graphic pictures out of those tensions. He returned to the subject of broken windows more than once, but even in his other pictures — like one of Mendenhall Glacier, made in 1973 and printed in high contrast, or one of peeling paint on a Portuguese wall in 1971, the paint dark and the wall beneath pale — he seemed to be pursuing the same highly contrasted, strongly gestural concerns. The avant-garde German photographer Ilse Bing’s broken window in Paris, from 1934, is crisp and cutting like Weston’s — but we’ve taken several steps back, and we see a substantial part of a building’s facade, including another window. It is now therefore a picture with context, and that context is poverty. Aaron Siskind’s repeated studies of broken windows zoomed farther in, excluding most of the frames and leaving us with abstract-expressionist patterns that gave as much space to glass as to its absence. Brassaï and Gordon Matta-Clark have pictures that delight in a series of broken windows, serried ranks of angular splotches, like verse after verse of a ragged song. Paolo Pellegrin’s \"A Gypsy Woman on the Train,\" made in Kosovo in 2001, is as much about the apprehensive passenger’s face as it is about the damaged window next to her; together they evoke war and displacement. But these photographs all have something in common. Every broken window is a frozen shock. Among the broken-window photographs of the Mandalay Bay resort, there are intriguing variants. In one, a spectator can be seen at ground level, with some police tape. Others take advantage of the proximity of the Las Vegas airport to the Las Vegas Strip, and juxtapose the resort with Air Force One, which brought the president on a visit three days after the massacre. One such photo shows the plane in the airport and the golden structure in the distance behind. Another, by the Reuters photographer Mike Blake, shows Air Force One flying past the building. It manages to present the glory of airplane technology and the fragility of glass in a single image (and brings to mind a photo of the Graf Zeppelin printed from a cracked dry-plate glass negative in 1929: flight and broken glass together). Blake’s photo places the scene of the crime side by side with the presidential plane: It’s almost a political statement. But a statement saying what? That the president is ignoring the problem? That his presence is a consolation to a frightened nation? It is a clear picture, but it has no clear political meaning. Many of our encounters with photographs today, those taken by us or those made by others, are through the glass of a mobile phone. The mobile phone is a kind of window, and it is always on the verge of breaking. The image world, echoing the real world, is correspondingly fragmentary. This is perhaps what makes the various photographs of the broken windows at the Mandalay Bay resort so poignant. And perhaps here, we do have a political lesson. An intact window is interesting mainly for its transparency. But when the window breaks, what intrigues us is the brittleness that was there all along.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/magazine/the-history-of-photography-is-a-history-of-shattered-glass.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Poem: Already My Lips Were Luminous', 'text': ' Selected by Terrance Hayes \"I do not know the language of that place\" underscores this poem’s striking balance of ambiguity and mystery.

Certainly he wasn’t tired — but she was exhausted and weak. A fever made her ache all over, and she hadn’t been able to keep any food down for days. She thought a hot bath might make her feel better, but instead she felt as if her already-meager energy had dissolved in the warm water. Holding the walls for support, she made her way to her bedroom. Now she lay on her bed covered by only the damp towel she used to dry off. Every muscle, every joint in her body throbbed as if she’d been beaten. It started a few days earlier. At first she thought it was just a bad cold — her nose was runny; her head and body ached. But it got worse every day. Her throat was raw, her head spun whenever she got up and a constant cough tore through her chest. She was taking acetaminophen — her obstetrician said that it was safe for her baby. It helped a little but not enough. Earlier that evening, she went to the \"gender reveal\" party her older sister organized for her and her boyfriend. All her best friends were there, and both families were thrilled to find out she was having a boy. All that excitement and joy kept her going until she got home and remembered how awful she felt. That’s when she took the bath. ↓ A Visit to the E.R. She heard her mother walk in and say her name, but she was too tired to answer. Her mother, seeing her 18-year-old daughter on the bed, not responding, was suddenly afraid. This wasn’t just a cold. She gave her daughter’s shoulder a little shake. She slowly opened her eyes. \"You need to go back to the hospital,\" she told her. She helped her daughter dress and get to the car. They had gone to Beaumont Hospital in Dearborn, Mich., the night before, but her mother was sure they needed to go back. The 15-minute drive seemed to take forever. In the E.R., the mother explained that her daughter had been sick for a few days and was steadily getting worse. The doctors they’d seen the day before said that she had some kind of virus. The illness wasn’t strep, and it wasn’t the flu — they tested her for those — so there was nothing they could do except give her acetaminophen and fluids. And that helped — but not for long. The fever and nausea returned. She hadn’t had anything to eat or drink for days now, at least nothing that stayed down. And she just seemed so out of it. The doctors, nurses and technicians fluttered about her half-awake daughter. The vomiting and diarrhea had left her dehydrated, and her blood chemistry was out of whack. They gave her fluids to replace the electrolytes she’d lost. The obstetrician came by and made sure the baby was O.K. He was. And then they sent them home again. Just a virus, they said. She was given a prescription for Zofran, a powerful anti-nausea drug, and a suggestion to take Pepto-Bismol for the diarrhea. She should start to feel better soon. ↓ Back Home Again But she didn’t. After two more days of feeling terrible, she asked her mother to take her back to the E.R. With this third visit in five days, and virtually the same story — the same fever, the same nausea and vomiting, the same aches — the doctors had to wonder if they had missed something. She had been tested for influenza using a fast test that takes less than 15 minutes, but that test can miss up to half of all flu cases. The doctors sent off a far more expensive and reliable test to look for evidence of influenza. They also retested her for strep. And they sent off more blood to look for the cause of the nausea and vomiting. This was lasting too long to be a run-of-the-mill gastrointestinal bug. The results showed that she didn’t have strep. But she did indeed have influenza; the first test had missed it. It might be too late for Tamiflu, but there was no harm in trying it. More surprising and concerning, the blood tests showed that the levels of liver enzymes that indicate injury were more than 10 times higher than normal. Liver injury can be seen in bad cases of influenza — though the enzyme level was not usually this high. The doctors admitted the patient to the intensive-care unit. ↓ Dangers of an Injured Liver Dr. Erik Sweet was the intern in the I.C.U. He, too, was concerned about the elevated liver enzymes. Maybe it was the flu, but could there be another reason for this injury? Had she taken any acetaminophen over the course of her illness? She had, she told him. Because she was pregnant, it was the only thing she was allowed to take. How much did she take, he asked. She took two extra-strength tablets (500 milligrams each) as often as every four hours, ingesting, perhaps, up to 6,000 milligrams each day. That was twice the maximum recommended dose. Sweet was alarmed. Acetaminophen is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Half of all patients with liver failure, and one-fifth of all patients who need a liver transplant, sustained their injury using this common over-the-counter medication. When acetaminophen passes through the liver, some of the drug is broken down into toxic chemicals. A healthy liver can dispose of these dangerous components. But the liver needs nutrients to do this, and because she was so sick, this woman wasn’t taking in much in the way of nutrients. In addition, because she was pregnant, she was sharing her nutrients with her fetus. All this put her at significant risk of being poisoned by the acetaminophen. What started off as simple influenza was now even more dangerous because of this possible slow overdose. ↓ Reversing the Damage Fortunately, there is an antidote to acetaminophen toxicity. N-acetylcysteine, called NAC, binds to the toxins that result from the breakdown of acetaminophen before they injure the liver. NAC can stop the damage and save the liver, if taken in time. Sweet ordered the NAC and sent off blood to confirm that her acetaminophen level was elevated. The result was surprising: The acetaminophen level was not elevated. There was no evidence of an acetaminophen overload. Perhaps the culprit was not the drug after all. Maybe influenza was causing the liver problem. Or maybe she had hepatitis. By now it was late at night. Sweet contacted the gastroenterologist on call, Dr. Aref Alrayes, to discuss what needed to be done. Even without seeing the patient, the doctor had two recommendations. First, the patient should be transferred to a nearby hospital with a ward dedicated to severe liver disease. Second, the patient should be given NAC. ↓ Slow-Motion Toxicity When patients take a single very large dose of acetaminophen, they have what is called acute acetaminophen poisoning — a huge blast of the medication overwhelms the body’s system of safe elimination. But there is also a slow form of poisoning. When ingested over days or weeks, intake of the medicine can still outpace elimination, and the accumulation can cause a chronic type of toxicity. Nearly one-third of these patients will have a normal acetaminophen level when measured. Even those patients should be given NAC, if they have a liver injury and have been taking acetaminophen, Alrayes told Sweet. The drug can be lifesaving, if acetaminophen is the culprit. If it is not, the dose of NAC would be safe for both mother and baby. The patient was started on intravenous NAC and transferred to the other hospital. It took a day or two, but slowly she began to feel better. Her nausea improved. Her appetite returned. And after four days, her liver showed signs of recovery. She was sent home. Her mother scoured the house and threw away every bottle of acetaminophen she could find. She was shocked that this medicine, which she’d always considered a friend, could be so dangerous. The rest of her daughter’s pregnancy went just fine. And her newest grandson will celebrate his 6-month birthday in the beginning of December.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/magazine/was-this-a-virus-or-something-more-dangerous-for-her-and-her-fetus.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'My Wife Is Done With Sex. Can I Turn Elsewhere?', 'text': ' I am in my mid-60s and have been happily married for decades. I have always been a very sexual person and consider myself healthy and normal, though at one end of the bell curve. A few years ago, my wife’s health worsened, and she declared herself no longer interested in sex of any kind. I continue to cherish her, but find the lack of sexual intimacy exceedingly difficult. I asked her permission to seek a friendly but not competitive sexual relationship elsewhere. There are many ethical issues already, but I wish to address another. In my description on a dating site, I explained the situation in some detail, as I did not wish to mislead anyone. My profile received a great deal of rejection, vituperation, condemnation and accusation. This calumny seemed to have two roots: I was a \"dirty old man\"; and I was — even with permission — \"cheating\" and should be punished. Both of these responses struck me as themselves immoral and unfair. My situation is not unique. However, there seems no pathway to address the ageism and biblical rigidity of a society that spends billions on youthfulness and eroticism and nothing on thought. What should I do? Name Withheld Marital vows should not, in ordinary circumstances, be subject to renegotiation. But you have taken your wife’s declaration to mark a departure from ordinary circumstances. What now? Sex requires the consent of all parties involved, and real consent rules out substantial misrepresentation. So you’ll have to find a partner who’s O.K. with your situation. This, as you’ve discovered, may be difficult, given the attitudes of the women on your dating site, most of whom will want at least the prospect of a romantic relationship. (You refer to having your wife’s permission; some of your respondents may have wondered whether she really felt she had a choice. But presumably you’ve decided that her consent was in fact full-hearted and freely given.) So you could work through the nasty comments on the dating site and see if your luck changes. Or you could find a site that caters to those in open relationships. Either way, I worry a bit. Sexual desire can addle the brain; even if your wife genuinely accepts the opening of your relationship, you don’t actually know where an affair might lead. This may be an argument for the sin of Onan, where there’s only yourself to fall in love with. An extended family member posted very private information about me on a social media platform under the guise of honoring me. I do not value this person, whose past actions reveal the character flaws that would lead someone to do such a thing. I do, however, value the person’s family. I am a very private person who only uses social media to observe what is happening in the lives of close friends and family. I never post anything about my private life. The shock of this invasion caused me to close my account immediately, but many people did see the post and commented on it. One person who saw the post and then the disappearance of my account contacted a close family member to inquire about it. Although this has caused me great anguish and embarrassment, I have not yet confronted the individual. My immediate family believes it demands a response, but I feel incapable of responding in an evenhanded way. Still, I want to make clear that this person crossed a line. Name Withheld This is all a little indirect and abstract; you clearly find writing about this affront exquisitely painful. But the standard contemporary way of putting what I think you are talking about is to say that someone \"outed\" you. The word originally referred to the exposure of someone as gay or lesbian, but now people speak of the outing of any of a host of identities or circumstances that a person may have a reason to keep private. Norms against outing are rightly strong. (There isn’t an absolute ban, but there have to be compelling reasons to out someone.) And if you want to do something to honor someone, you should reflect on whether he or she is likely to be pleased by what you’re doing. Your relation got at least two things seriously wrong, then, and you’re entitled to resent what this person has done. Letting the person know that you resent it might be better than seething in private. But if you can’t bring yourself to do so directly, you can surely ask someone in the family to make your feelings clear. (And if you return to the world of social media, you can block him or her.) An apology is obviously in order. But the most productive role of apology is in repairing a broken relationship, and this is not what you are after. Indeed, your firm statement that you \"do not value this person\" invites the suspicion that your feelings may be reciprocated. A friend forwarded me an email she received about a college classmate of ours who recently died. It turns out that this classmate ended her life because of some psychological issues relating to an unusual condition that materialized in the last two years.  The woman who wrote the email that was circulating was my classmate’s sister; she shared some conversation screenshots with time stamps that demonstrated her sister’s growing mental distress. She made it clear that she was sharing this material because she wanted to raise awareness of this condition.  I had never heard of the condition, so it was illuminating, but I feel unsettled and guilty for knowing these details, as my classmate took so much care to keep them secret while she was alive. We weren’t close, and while I was fond of her, I wouldn’t want someone whom I knew only peripherally to be privy to such private details. But considering that this information could potentially lead me to help a friend in the future, is it O.K. that it is circulating after her death? Name Withheld A person’s interest in privacy — the topic of our previous letter — doesn’t disappear when he or she dies, though over time it diminishes. Little time has passed in this case; whatever desire this woman had for privacy carries real weight. On the other hand, the person who is circulating this information is her sister, who is motivated by the desire that others should be able to succeed in saving a life where she couldn’t.

In Spain, where I live, the cacerolada — or the banging of pots and pans together, a word that translates roughly as \"casseroling\" — is an increasingly popular form of protest. The sound comes on gradually, tapping and clanking, at first a tentative rat-tat-tat from somewhere down the street. Word spreads at the speed of Twitter, and the sound bursts forth from balcony after balcony, multiplying like aluminum wildfire down avenues and alleys. Patterns emerge: rapid-fire tattoos, son clave rhythms, the \"shave and a haircut\" riff. They pile up in a cacophony of soup spoons against copper pots, lids against lids, high-pitched pings and basso thwacks. Cars honk their horns in solidarity; chanting voices join in. Down on the street, a man walking his dog claps his hands in rhythm; a woman jingles her keys. All of Barcelona feels connected by this web of din. I don’t remember what was being protested the first time I witnessed a cacerolada, but I have a visceral recollection of the sound. I write about music for a living, and my tastes run toward styles that emphasize pulse and noise: minimalist techno, ambient drones, all manner of metallic abstraction. Hearing it rippling through the windows was as though the avant-garde records I tend to champion had been unleashed in the streets and blown up to larger-than-life size, in some kind of wild, Borgesian transmutation. It felt like a vindication of my tastes, as if the universe had handed me the aux cord and invited me to throw on whatever I liked: Lou Reed’s \"Metal Machine Music,\" Balinese gamelan, African drumming — maybe even all three at once. But caceroladas are not meant to be aesthetic experiences; they are expressions of popular indignation. There is something primal in this particular ritual too; similar traditions, like the public shamings known as charivari, or \"rough music,\" date back to at least the Middle Ages in Europe, and maybe longer. Throughout Latin America, where they are also called cacerolazos, they have been a favorite outlet for public discontent since at least the 1980s. They have been common in Spain since 2003, when they were mobilized to register opposition to the looming war in Iraq. Recently, here in Barcelona, caceroladas have been a regular occurrence in the long, drawn-out battle between the Catalan separatist movement and the Spanish central government. At first, as a foreigner, I declined to take part in the nightly protests. But after the violence of the Oct. 1 independence referendum, in which the national police broke up the voting in a shocking display of force, I joined in. This was no longer merely a protest in favor of regional self-determination; it was a cry for basic dignity. Anyone who has ever sung in a school choir or banged out \"Louie Louie\" in a garage band knows the gut-level joy of shaping sound with other people. It is all the more thrilling when your bandmate is the grandmother from the apartment next door, who is attacking her frying-pan lids as though they were crash cymbals. Banging away on my balcony, I had a flashback to my college days, when we used to observe a tradition known as the Primal Scream. The midnight before finals began, everyone would gather in the quad, or throw open their dorm windows, and shout themselves hoarse. Something about that release of energy had the effect of focusing the mind and honing the spirit. Participating in a cacerolada is no different. I have begun to wish desperately that Americans might consider importing the tradition. True, there are hurdles. The United States is a largely suburban nation, while caceroladas are optimized for urban settings. But the benefits are numerous. The elderly, children and people with disabilities can easily take part, and virtually everyone has a pot and a wooden spoon. As forms of protest go, the cacerolada is as egalitarian as it gets. Perhaps the most inspiring thing about caceroladas is that they need not express any coherent political message at all: They are an indication of shared discontent, the last refuge of the totally fed up. That certainly recommends them to the American political landscape right now, when every issue — gun control, gerrymandering, global warming — feels like a lost cause. In the face of political alienation, making a mighty racket is a powerful feeling. Maybe a cacerolada wouldn’t solve our problems, but as a kind of primal-scream therapy, it would be better than nothing. In Barcelona, the political situation changes on a daily basis. But on the ground, life lurches forward, stuck in a holding pattern. Strikes are called; strikes are called off. Marches for national unity represent the so-called silent majority of Catalans who don’t want independence — yet far-right nationalists sieg-heiling in the streets trigger troubling echoes of the dictator Gen. Francisco Franco’s Spain. No one seems to know what’s going on, but throughout it all, the caceroladas continue, their volume fluctuating depending upon the day’s outrages. I have ceased taking part in the protests: At the end of the day, even though my wife and daughter are Catalan, and Spanish, I’m still an outsider here. It’s not my battle. But I still throw open my balcony doors every time I hear the tinny pulse kick in. Even if I do feel caught in the middle, the sound of discord remains mesmerizing.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-caceroladas.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'How to Save a Knocked-Out Tooth', 'text': ' \"The idea is to get the tooth back in the mouth as quickly as possible,\" says Gene Solmundson, the dentist for the Winnipeg Jets of the National Hockey League. First, locate the tooth. Pick it up carefully, touching only the shiny crown and not the bloody root. \"Don’t put it in your purse or in your pocket,\" Solmundson says. Adults and children old enough to avoid accidentally swallowing a tooth — every year in the United States, more than five million of them are knocked out — can keep it tucked inside their cheek. Hockey players tend to be impatient with midgame dentistry, even in cases involving a mouthful of busted teeth. \"They just want to get back out on the ice,\" says Solmundson, who has a dental-exam chair in the Jets’ locker room and is a founding member of the N.H.L.’s Team Dentists Association. Rinse off any debris using milk, saline solution or water. Don’t touch or scrub the root, and leave be any fleshy bits. Insert the clean tooth into its empty socket as soon as possible to give the periodontal ligaments, nerves and blood supply the best chance to heal and reattach. \"When it’s in the right place, the person should be able to bite their teeth together normally,\" Solmundson says. Go see a dentist, who will usually splint the tooth so it doesn’t fall out again or get swallowed during sleep. Above all, do not let the tooth dry out. A tooth stored in the right type of liquid can be successfully replanted up to an hour later, but a desiccated tooth has little chance of surviving. Hockey-team dentists tend to store teeth in pH-balanced liquids made for transporting human tissue, but cold milk, saliva and saline solution work, too. Use water as a last resort. Young children who dislodge a primary tooth should have a dentist examine their mouths before reinserting the tooth to avoid damaging the permanent replacement growing in under the gum. Solmundson has fixed dozens of teeth knocked out of the mouths of pros, gaptoothed youth-league players and so-called beer-league players, who are, he says, especially prone to the reckless play that might end in a puck or stick to the mouth. The best way to save a tooth is to keep it in your mouth. \"Wear a mouth guard,\" he says.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/magazine/how-to-save-a-knocked-out-tooth.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'How the ‘Resistance’ Helped Democrats Dominate Virginia', 'text': ' on the morning of the Women’s March on Washington in January, Kathryn Sorenson was an hour west of D.C., en route to her new apartment, when a car broadsided her and broke her neck. She had been passing through a dangerous intersection — busy roads, no stoplights — and her first thought, as she waited for the ambulance to arrive, was about the inadequacy of local governance: In the Northern Virginia exurbs, rapid growth has long outstripped traffic oversight. Still, as a young Democratic campaign manager, it seemed to her vaguely unprofessional to have broken her neck on such a politically momentous day. \"I wasn’t even out fighting the machine,\" she said, \"just coming back from the dry cleaners.\" The first to arrive at her hospital bed — before her mother — were David Reid, a local businessman, and his wife, who had called around to every regional emergency room until they found her. Even if she hadn’t broken her neck, she most likely couldn’t have taken even a few hours off work to attend the march: She was the manager, and sole employee, of the two-week-old David Reid for Delegate campaign. Sorenson met Reid on New Year’s Day for a mutual interview; Reid, a well-kept, goateed father of two in his mid-50s, was a latecomer to politics, and was relieved when Sorenson agreed to lead his campaign for the House of Delegates, the 100-member lower chamber of Virginia’s legislature. In her six years out of college, Sorenson had worked continuously on campaigns, all but one of them in Northern Virginia, and despite her youth, she exhibited the grim, sardonic cheer of the veteran operative. Sorenson agreed to work with a novice like Reid because he seemed committed to real issues, and he made a sincere first impression. Also, she liked his odds. Virginia’s 32nd house district is part of Loudoun County, one of the fastest growing counties in the country and, by median income, the wealthiest. Verdant, indistinguishable subdivisions are laid out in self-contained loops between windowed blocks of strip mall and windowless blocks of data center. There are overpasses to nowhere; there are construction sites that look like Caterpillar sales lots as well as actual Caterpillar sales lots. The county and its schools are around 30 percent nonwhite, with a large immigrant population. (Sorenson’s favorite local lunch spot is an Afghan kebab joint.) The 32nd went for Hillary Clinton by 19 points. There was, Sorenson quickly got into the habit of saying, \"absolutely no reason this district has a Republican delegate.\" The day she took the job, Sorenson put together an Excel document with all the precinct-level returns from the 2013 race, which the Democrat lost by only 651 votes. \"I looked for where we needed to run it up, where we needed to hold our own and where it was going to be hand-to-hand combat.\" She soon came to understand, however, that her seasons of training had hardly prepared her for the new political reality. Twelve days after her accident, she went to a meeting of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, expecting to encounter the usual 30-odd regulars. Instead, she found 300 new faces. \"Who the heck are all these people?\" she wondered. It was, after all, an off-election year, and it was winter. They had come, she realized, on behalf of what she began to call \"the pop-up groups.\" She went to as many of their meetings as she could and found that many of their members were largely unacquainted with politics, especially on the local level. Some of them weren’t even county residents; they were from McLean, and Arlington, and D.C., and even Maryland. Though a majority of these meetings might have been better described as meetings about meetings, she nevertheless admired all these new faces and the vitality they were prepared to bring to what were ordinarily considered marginal down-ballot races. Sorenson, whose one-woman campaign — the candidate had a demanding day job — was limited by a cumbersome and unsightly cervical collar, had few illusions that all these new volunteer hearts had been set aflame by the local business owner and retired Navy Reserve commander David Reid, even if everybody who met him agreed right away that he seemed like a profoundly decent guy with the right priorities. She knew that their primary motivation was their hatred for the president, and that their secondary motivation was their hatred of their local Republican congresswoman, but she was optimistic that they might be taught to direct some of their umbrage toward Reid’s incumbent Republican opponent, Tag — \"Sorry,\" she’d say, with mock solemnity, \"Delegate Greason.\" What Sorenson needed from these inchoate volunteer armies, however, was not a collective expression of outrage; it was reliable support for campaign practicalities like door-knocking and phone-banking, tasks that lacked the glamour and solidarity of marches and protests. Even those who could readily speak about state and local issues — how the Republicans in the House of Delegates had refused the Medicaid expansion and passed a sheaf of anti-abortion bills; how Loudoun County was the only district in Northern Virginia without full-day kindergarten; how somebody needed to put a stoplight at Waxpool and Demott, where Sorenson was almost killed — were rarely acquainted with the proper channels for action. They would talk about calling their representative, and Sorenson would say, \"That’s not a congressional thing, that’s a state thing!\" or \"That’s not a state thing, that’s a supervisor thing! Call your supervisor!\" Sorenson showed them how to find out who their supervisors were. They wanted to write letters to Terry McAuliffe, the governor, about bathroom discrimination. She said: \"Don’t write letters to Terry! The bathroom bill is dead, don’t worry. It died in subcommittee, and even if it hadn’t, Terry had already promised to veto it, so pick a better battle!\" If a more grizzled campaign manager might have thought only to harness this energy, Sorenson saw an opportunity to help organize it. When the volunteers made proposals that seemed impractical or irrelevant, she did not issue judgment. \"I didn’t want to rain on their ideas,\" she said. Instead, she gently tried to usher them in productive directions. She told them about what a great guy David Reid was, how he’d come from poverty and sent his two girls to local public schools and today stood for full-day kindergarten and gun control and Medicaid expansion and distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. She also told them about Reid’s Republican opponent, Tag — \"Sorry, Delegate Greason\" — and all the party-line votes he’d made down in Richmond. \"He votes 99 percent of the time with the Republican leadership. From assault rifles to bazookas to ninja stars, he’s for it.\" To get Reid on the ballot, Sorenson explained, the campaign needed to collect 125 signatures by March. The pop-up groups were happy to help, especially because Sorenson had a pleasant, easygoing appeal, not to mention a broken neck. Within a few weeks, she was given almost 600 names. She couldn’t quite account for how it was done; these groups didn’t have leadership, exactly, or if they did, they had large \"steering committees\" — and they could be touchy if you used the wrong word or gave one individual too much credit — but they used Facebook and they contacted friends of friends and somehow they got the signatures they needed. And not only that. Representatives from some groups got the required signatures, and then representatives from some other groups materialized to vet those signatures and remove inadvertent out-of-district signatories, and then still other representatives from different or maybe the same groups suggested they might help Sorenson by formatting all of that petition data so they could merge the relevant information with their master voter file. As long as Sorenson was explicit about what she needed, it all seemed to just ... happen. In the months after Trump’s inauguration, there was no shortage of expressive opportunities for the left — protests, actions — but few electoral conduits for its new resolve. Virginia provided one of them. In what Sorenson unsentimentally called \"16,\" Hillary Clinton carried the state by more than five points, but the previous year’s election had preserved for the Republicans a considerable edge in the House of Delegates: 66 to 34. Not a single incumbent lost. Now, in advance of 2017, Democrats couldn’t help thinking it auspicious that exactly 17 of those Republican delegates came from Clinton districts. If the party could flip only those seats this year, it would come away with a 51-49 majority. This seemed like a totally fanciful possibility to Sorenson herself, but she wasn’t blind to its inspirational potency: Flip the Hillary districts, flip the house. A majority of the pop-up groups were experiments in decentralized organizing, so individual chapters were free to expend their energy where and how they pleased. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of actual elections this year, they flocked in disproportionate numbers to Virginia — and in particular to its 32nd district. Reid’s district had no primary, for one thing, and seemed acutely winnable. It also had Sorenson. She was not only competent; she was, at least outwardly, calm. She also reached out to each group on its own terms, even if that effort alone absorbed three or four hours of each day. And she didn’t want to seem exploitative, so she refused on principle to blast the groups’ lists with what she called \"hair-on-fire send-$5-now-or-the-world-will-end emails.\" Though in theory these groups had diverse goals, the impression they made on Sorenson was one of a great, reverberant longing. \"There’s just this huge energy,\" Sorenson told me, \"with people saying, ‘We want to do something right now, we want to effect change in this election.’\\u2009\" They were hard to keep track of: who was with which group, what each one cared about, which groups were subgroups or affinity groups of other groups, which had national umbrella organizations and which didn’t, which terms of art groups preferred to describe their particular variety of leaderlessness. There were chapters and huddles and pods, and they used Google Forms or Google Docs or Eventbrites or Meetups. She found herself scrolling through endless Facebook commentaries in search of group moderators or other sources of provisional authority. She began to build her own Google Doc as a central storehouse for all the fugitive information. This color-coded document included but was not limited to, in no particular order, the following groups: 31st Street Swing Left; Code Blue; Indivisible Del Ray; Indivisible VA Assembly 42; Network NoVA; NOVANation Coalition; Sister District DC; Sister District Maryland; Swing Left; Together We Will NoVA; Vienna Neighbors United; VOTE MOB VA; WofA (We of Action); ACT Empowered; We ARE the People Who Stand Up; Loudoun 4 Women’s March on Washington; Hunter Mill Huddle; Arlington Huddle Action Network; Neighbors for a Blue Virginia; Ward 3 Democrats; the Resurgent Left; Turn It Blue DC (formerly Swing Left NE DC); Dining for Democracy; #Citizen. Sorenson got a kick out of the names the groups had given themselves. She loved one called the Huddlery. Sorenson’s list included the names of the principals, to which she often felt obligated to append the qualification \"(co-leader?)\" or \"(steering committee member?).\" She documented their purpose, insofar as she could divine it; her perception of their viability (\"all talk no plans\"); and their willingness to help the Reid campaign to, as her own hashtag put it, #flip32blue. Each of the groups wanted Sorenson to make some kind of pitch for why they should direct their resources her way. Some, like Flippable, had former campaign people on staff; they just needed to hear the numbers and they’d mail a check. Others, like the West L.A. Democratic Club, asked her questions for an hour before saying no. Some had clear purity tests — \"Will you take the no-PAC-money-ever pledge?\" \"Were you endorsed by Senator Sanders?\" — and Sorenson’s campaign didn’t always check all the boxes. Others were concerned that she didn’t need the help badly enough. Sorenson did her best to put her candidate and their campaign up for adoption in a way that made their specific requirements clear. It was going to be expensive, for one thing. They had to raise at least $400,000, or $500,000 if she wanted her \"Cadillac plan.\" The map of Loudoun County is a Mandelbrot set of nested subdivisions, and three of her precincts — the Villas, Lansdowne Woods and the Ashby Ponds retirement community — are gated and thus \"unknockable,\" which meant the campaign would have to double down on phone banking. This would require a lot of coordination. Running against a seven-year incumbent, Reid also faced a huge deficit in name recognition, which meant that early preparatory canvassing was just as important as a late turnout effort. Money and time would always be the hardest asks, but while Sorenson was still neck-braced and understaffed, there were plenty of basic start-up tasks to complete. One outfit offered to make the campaign an easily updatable website. Another sent a member to take photographs, which saved the campaign $700. Sorenson offhandedly mentioned that it would be nice to have a spreadsheet itemizing all of Tag Greason’s votes in his seven years in the House of Delegates — bill number, how he voted, why it matters. She had it within hours. Yet another organization delivered print-at-home postcards that recalled classic Americana, marked with parks and schools and polling places; she wanted people to keep in mind that the 32nd district was an actual place. She loved the postcards, even if she had to send repeated reminders about which disclosures were necessary to make them compliant with campaign-finance law. It wasn’t lost on her that some of the work being done was redundant, and that some of her interactions required more effort than they ultimately returned, but Sorenson understood that the new spirits were fragile. She tried to remind herself that each group brought its own perspective or talent, even as her attempt to outline their special characteristics revealed a litany of special needs. One group was part of a Jewish organization and thus couldn’t canvass on Saturdays. Another one wanted to know how to get over to Loudoun without paying tolls, and many of its members were older and needed printed directions or car pools. But Sorenson’s willingness to keep track of and accommodate all these preferences gave her word-of-mouth fame. No research trial — volunteer-coordination software, fund-raising by text message — was too small or bug-ridden for her to disdain, and she joked that she was first in every line to serve as a guinea pig. In June, Shaun Daniels, then an executive director of an influential PAC called Win Virginia, told me, \"No one anywhere is working with more outside groups than Kathryn.\" Democratic politics had entered a new era of experimentation, he said, and \"this here is ground zero.\" By the middle of June, Sorenson had hired a field director and a field organizer, both from the Clinton campaign. They chose the weekend of June 24 for their earnest summer opener — a \"Weekend of Action\" — in part because it coincided with a Network NoVA event called the Women’s Summit. This daylong happening brought together participants from across the pop-up group universe to hear speeches from 35 of the House of Delegate candidates left standing after the Democratic primaries the week before. These primaries had delivered a remarkable slate — most of them first-time candidates, a majority of them women, including many from the working class and many of color. Sorenson did not feel competitive, and had great warmth for her colleagues in other races, but she knew that some of the pop-up groups would be tempted to exchange Reid for a candidate of greater charisma or a more diverse background, like the sheep farmer in a nearby district. She didn’t want her outside collaborators to forget that they joined up with her (and Reid’s) effort early and for good reasons. The other salient election was the recent runoff between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. Sorenson herself was not disposed to draw any big lessons from Ossoff’s defeat, which she was by nature unable to regard as a leading indicator on the president, or the Democratic Party, or the role of outside patrons. It seemed to her that the campaign was waged about as well as it could have been in a district that was close to impossible for a Democrat to win. For many of her volunteers, however, the loss felt like a dispiriting prelude to what was supposed to be a stirring campaign kickoff. Early in the morning, a crowd of campaign staff members, longstanding volunteers and outside irregulars milled around Reid’s home in anticipation of their canvassing shifts. The family’s two shiba inus were underfoot, the coffee table was decorated with back issues of astronomy and archaeology magazines and the whole place smelled faintly but persistently of maple syrup. There were cars from Massachusetts and Missouri, and Reid joked more than once about how he kept meaning to give out an award for the person who traveled the farthest to be there. The volunteers were mostly women, and mostly middle-aged, and had come outfitted for day hikes of moderate exertion. Whenever one of them was asked which group, if any, she had come with, there was a perceptible pause as she thought about the profusion of mailers in her inbox and posts in her Facebook feed. Those there for the first time were nervous about how they would be greeted. A woman from Vienna, Va., named Francesca, in capri-length cargo pants, sturdy boots and a beaded necklace, raised her hand. She had come on behalf of half a dozen groups. \"Am I going to look like a carpetbagger, or should I say that I care so much that I came here from elsewhere?\" Reid looked to Sorenson before responding. \"Nobody will ask you because you look like the district — it’s pretty diverse here. We joke that we give an award for the person who came the furthest. All of this, here, it’s really starting to make a difference.\" The volunteers were shuffled through a brief orientation, which was longer on Reid’s biography — a foster child who was the first in his family to go to college; a local businessman who sent his daughters to the public schools; a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer who gave 23 years of service to his country — than it was on his positions. But the point of the summer canvass was deliberately introductory. Francesca, the woman from Vienna, cleared a space for me in her cluttered minivan. She’d worked on clean-energy policy, she told me en route, but her entire department was recently eliminated. We passed a new data center across from a data center under construction. She delivered an impassioned monologue as she tried to pay attention to the GPS; she had an air of spiky distraction, as if stopping to scowl at news alerts while watching a TV show. \"Now the Klan is out in Charlottesville when they take down the Confederate monuments. Just the other day I went to the website of the Southern Poverty Law Center for the first time in my life. It’s intersectionality. If affluent people like me aren’t caring about Black Lives Matter, well — it kind of opened my eyes. We can’t ever not be engaged again. It’s like the Founding Fathers’ idea of the yeoman government. My progressive friends, they’re on Facebook but they’re not out canvassing and phone-banking. There’s nothing else going on in ’17, and there’s all this pent-up energy.\" Francesca said she had gone to the Women’s Summit the previous morning and left exhilarated, but what she took away from the conference wasn’t wholly clear. Each delegate emphasized the importance of gerrymandering, and health care, and school funding, and rural broadband, and the state of the roads. If the national Democratic Party really was in crisis, torn between cultural politics and pocketbook issues, it certainly wasn’t visible at the summit. The biggest applause line of the day came from Danica Roem, a transgender former journalist and \"freshman member of the Democratic Party\" who won a surprise victory in a four-way primary in District 13, to the south. \"My opponent,\" she said with national-stage charisma, \"cares more about where I go to the bathroom than how you get to work!\" Francesca, however, seemed to have little interest in low-stakes issues like the office vacancies on Manassas Drive. \"We’re literally fighting for our democracy,\" she said. \"It’s ‘Handmaid’s Tale.’\\u2009\" We got out to canvass in a subdivision of modest flagpoled homes on branching cul-de-sacs. Francesca traipsed over people’s lawns and rapped hard on doors. The hit rate with canvassing is always low, and over two hours on a hot and cloudless Sunday, we encountered only half a dozen families at home. In the few conversations Francesca did have, she was invariably friendly and polite, but her pitch about Reid was mostly that he was a great guy; every once in a while she remembered to say that he was in favor of full-day kindergarten districtwide or distance-based tolls on the Dulles Greenway. In her one extended interaction, a young mother began by saying that her family cared above all about full-day kindergarten. She had only ever voted in presidential elections, she admitted, but then managed, over the course of five minutes, to convince herself that she was wrong to do so. \"I don’t vote in the local but I guess I really need to now,\" she said. \"Well, I was never out canvassing before, either!\" Francesca said. Some volunteers I accompanied were more careful to stay off lawns, or more fluent in the local issues, or had greater experience with the mechanics of political campaigns; some remembered that a \"1\" on the voter-information sheet meant most likely to vote for David Reid, while others were sure that great enthusiasm was recorded with a \"5.\" On the record, they were always positive about their huddles and steering committees, even if off the record they wondered whether the welter of organizations meant duplicative or otherwise-inefficient resource allocation. No one, however, seemed frustrated by the fact that they reached only a handful of voters, or discouraged from making a return trip. By the end of the weekend, more than 40 volunteers had knocked on more than 2,500 doors. Sorenson rarely allowed herself to be thrilled by anything, but she conceded some satisfaction that these were patently terrific results. This wasn’t to say that everything had gone smoothly. When canvassing was over, Sorenson checked the campaign’s email account to find a restrained but irate message from a community member, upset that his home’s \"no soliciting\" sign was ignored. The volunteer stood and argued about the First Amendment. The voter leaned Republican, he continued, but had always voted on both sides of the aisle, and from what he knew about David Reid, he was interested. This encounter, however, had cost them his vote. This didn’t sound to Sorenson like one of her own people. She looked up the planned itineraries of one of the outside groups — an organization dedicated to voter-suppression issues — and found that it must have been someone from its camp. Sorenson wasn’t sure there was much she could do. \"They have a different list, and a different script, and different priorities. We tell our people in training not to get into constitutional battles, but each group does its own thing.\" The interaction was, Sorenson thought, a bummer, but she couldn’t afford to dedicate any more time to it just then. She had email to answer, and as she took out her phone, I looked down at mine. There was a news alert that the Supreme Court had upheld part of Trump’s travel ban, and I read it aloud. At first Sorenson didn’t seem to know what I was talking about. Then she said: \"Oh, him. I can’t even worry about him. I can’t even think about him.\" She was late for another call, this one with the group that had the wrong compliance box on their folksy print-at-home postcards. It lasted an hour. It is never easy to assess a campaign’s progress, particularly one that is likely to be won or lost by a few hundred votes, but over the summer the Reid campaign appeared to have cultivated a meaningfully committed base, among local voters and elsewhere. A San Francisco group called the Sister District Project, which pairs volunteers in deeply blue or red districts with campaigns in purple ones and had quickly become one of Sorenson’s most useful and beloved allies, had helped them set up an Amazon Wish List. Now far-flung supporters could buy them toner or printer paper. They handily outraised Delegate Greason for the month of June — $53,000 to his $39,000 — with five and a half times as many total contributions and 12 times as many grass-roots donors. Greason was still up $36,000 in cash on hand, but there was almost certainly enough time to close that gap, especially since the Reid campaign had raised enough money to hire a finance director, a young woman who had worked on the Ohio senatorial campaign; she would save Sorenson countless trips to the Post Office and the bank. On the third weekend in July, Sorenson was working from home when she checked the campaign’s Facebook page and saw a photo of some 30-odd canvassers, 20 of them from the group that had done the campaign’s website. \"I was like, Holy cow, you usually see those numbers later in the year.\" By the end of August they’d visited 32,556 doors. The House Democratic Caucus looked at their stats and decided to award them two additional paid positions. The major development was an unexpected shift in the dynamics at the top of the ticket. The governor and the state’s two senators were Democrats; the pipe dream for November 2017 was to bring the State Legislature into line. In August, however, the Republican gubernatorial candidate — a former lobbyist, R.N.C. chairman and all-around establishment figure named Ed Gillespie — hired an erstwhile Trump campaign operative and reinvented himself in the president’s image. He began to speak out against the removal of Confederate monuments and in favor of the travel ban. He spoke about the danger of \"sanctuary cities,\" even though Virginia has none, and ran campaign ads about Latino gang violence that prompted a rare public rebuke from Obama. It was hard to tell how this affected Sorenson’s race, though the summer poll wasn’t good; Reid was down by seven. But the race, Sorenson knew, was always going to come down to turnout. The weekend after Labor Day would hopefully set the tone for the fall, when, with any luck, the name recognition they’d worked to foster might begin to translate into voter commitments. When returning summer volunteers arrived, they found a more mature operation: there was a sign-in table in the entryway, three times the turnout and a campaign staff large enough for one person to do check in, one person to divide the turf and a third to guide the orientations. Reid as a candidate seemed looser and more confident. He’d received recent endorsements from the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, and was willing to talk about more difficult subjects. \"There’s some hesitation among people of color to put up yard signs\" for a Democrat, he told a group of volunteers, \"after what we’ve seen, down in Charlottesville and elsewhere, with the emboldening of white supremacists.\" He did not seem like the sort of person who’d ever had reason to refer to white supremacy. He was, however, still making the same joke about giving an award to whoever had traveled the farthest to volunteer. For canvassers, the script was slightly different in this phase of the campaign. They were now instructed to ask directly if the campaign could count on the respondent’s vote. The field organizer explained that if volunteers found themselves in a position to discuss Delegate Greason’s record in Richmond, they should mention that he missed more than 700 votes — 713, to be precise. A volunteer raised his hand to ask how many pieces of legislation actually came before the delegates; he thought it would be more impressive to express Greason’s absences as a percentage. Sorenson, at her computer, rolled her eyes. Once he left, she looked up. \"I know exactly how many pieces of legislation came before the chamber, and I picked that number for a reason! We do not want to express it as a percentage.\" For every volunteer who saw fit to challenge the campaign’s authority or its expertise, however, there were half a dozen there for a political education. If everybody hated the tolls, more than one canvasser asked, why were they so high? Well, the campaign answered, the Australian firm that owned the Dulles Greenway had donated $8,000 to Delegate Greason. There was something about the modesty of that figure that got even distant volunteers incensed on behalf of the local community. The conflicts surrounding Trump’s D.C. hotel and the emoluments clause were exasperating but remote in their immensity, whereas a $6 toll for a $2.29 bottle of milk was an affront you could grasp. With 11 days to go before the election, their ground strategy shifted from the voter-commitment stage to the final get-out-the-vote effort; on the campaign’s final Saturday, they enlisted 205 volunteers to go door to door helping voters articulate an explicit plan for when and how they’d go to the polls on Tuesday. The race, as Sorenson predicted, was going to come down to turnout on the margins: their tracking poll had them in a dead heat. Sorenson’s estimate was that Reid needed 13,150 votes to win, and it was easy for her to imagine that the final tallies would be within the 1 percent margin that would trigger an automatic recount. With the race tightening, Greason sent mailers that described Reid as a radical leftist who had taken \"tens of thousands of dollars from New York, Washington and California.\" Sorenson showed it to me and shrugged. \"Well, that last part’s true.\" Sorenson was grateful for all the money and help from her outside volunteers, but what most moved her was when she felt someone had made the organizational leap from political fury to political identification. When one of her Sister District captains in Maryland asked for a yard sign, Sorenson furrowed her brow and asked her why she wanted one on the other side of the river. The volunteer simply said, \"We need to expand what we think of as our own backyard.\" Sorenson didn’t have a lot of time for mawkishness, but that idea, she said, \"is just beautiful to me.\" And she could appreciate whatever it was that got people newly involved in politics and kept them there. If Indivisible wanted to call Virginia \"the first statewide referendum on Trump,\" that was fine with her, as long as they didn’t set expectations so high that their support couldn’t survive a disappointment. Election Day was a dark deluge of hard, driving rain. Sorenson put on high green galoshes and met Reid at his polling place at 7 a.m., then sent him on a tour of polling locations to shake hands and take selfies. She went back to their staging location in the rec room of some dedicated supporters. Everybody seemed to have a different idle conviction about which kind of voter was most susceptible to the weather, but Sorenson screened out the chatter, sitting on a high stool in front of her laptop, an overheated phone in her hand. She left only to vote herself, and to check up on an alarming but ultimately false story she heard about an older supporter who’d had her ballot disqualified for no reason. The foot traffic — not just the usual folks from D.C. or Maryland, but people who came from California, Florida and Iowa — was so steady that the campaign began to run out of clipboards. Volunteers would arrive, muddy and soaked, peel off their clear ponchos and hand over their unreadably macerated voter rolls. By midafternoon, they were almost finished with the fifth complete pass they’d done, over their 11-day \"mobilization window,\" of all 10,000 doors in their universe. Most returnees declared that everyone on their lists had either voted already or was just waiting for a spouse to come watch the kids; some of them stopped Sorenson to tell her stories about how they took a moment at the end of their shifts to circle back around and check on these promissory replies, and more often than not they encountered \"I voted\" stickers. Then they’d be handed a new packet and sent back out into the rain. Someone in need of reprieve asked Sorenson when she planned to wrap things up for the day. \"When do you stop? If your nearest polling place closes at 7:00 and is two minutes away, you stop at 6:58.\" Sorenson didn’t feel she could really trust the numbers that were coming in — turnout, she thought, couldn’t realistically be as high as it seemed to be — but by 4 o’clock she could no longer ignore the fact that most polling places had already far exceeded the totals they usually showed in off years. She dealt with her mounting anxiety by making new spreadsheets to compare precinct-level historical data and devoted her last hour of her campaign’s last day to one final round of phone-banking to voters in what she worried was her one underperforming precinct. The campaign party was at a favorite strip-mall wine bar. Sorenson went home to change, thinking she might have a moment to herself before the results came in, but by the time she and the rest of her team arrived, 90 percent of Loudoun’s precincts were reporting. Reid’s race was one of the first calls. He won with more than 17,000 votes, by at least 17 points. Shoals of well-wishers formed around Sorenson, touching her arms and shoulders and yelling through their tears. \"You are so [expletive] awesome,\" one said. \"You brought happiness back into our lives,\" said another. Sorenson made her way through the crowd slowly and with only a small, hesitant, curious smile. Every few minutes the growing crowd reacted to new results. Wins at the top of the ticket brought sighs of relief, but the shouted announcement of each successive delegate victory triggered gasps and whoops of astonishment: the first Asian-American woman, the first two Latina women, the first out lesbian, the first trans woman, an African-American woman, even a woman in a Trump district; altogether at least 11 new Democratic women, seven from Northern Virginia alone, in a swell that seemed likely to result in 16 flipped districts for a tied House. Eventually Sorenson sat down with her finance and field directors — the three young women, Reid later proclaimed, who organized a legion of volunteers and brought them to victory — to eat some cheese; she particularly liked the kind of Brie they had there, which is why they chose the venue for the party. She stopped to read a congratulatory text from \"Joe Biden’s guy.\" Her finance director looked over at her and asked, through a flood of tears: \"How are you so calm? I feel like we’ve all been in our little bubble, but look\" — she gestured toward the television overhead — \"we’re on MSNBC! How are you not crying?\" Sorenson just smiled her smile of mellow detachment, and finally spoke. \"I just kind of want to throw my phone into the ocean.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/magazine/how-the-resistance-helped-democrats-dominate-virginia.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '', 'text': '', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/16/magazine/uncounted-civilian-casualties-iraq-airstrikes.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Spurned by ESPN, Barstool Sports Is Staying on Offense', 'text': ' In the offices of Barstool Sports, on two floors of a narrow building in the Flatiron district of Manhattan, there’s a full bar, a semicircle of sticky leather recliners and a wall of flat-screen televisions. Almost every other bit of square footage on the editorial floor is occupied by a dude at work — dudes carrying props, dudes spitting tobacco juice into plastic bottles, dudes typing up blog posts and tracking page views. The center of the space, marked by a giant menorah, operates as a full-time modular studio, pumping out all sorts of content: Barstool produces a Sirius XM radio show (soon to be a whole channel), a growing list of podcasts and up to 90 blog posts a day. The dudes who make this stuff are uniformly young and white. In the three days I spent at Barstool headquarters, the only women I saw were Erika Nardini, the company’s chief executive; Asa Akira, the world-famous porn star who co-hosted a Barstool podcast; and the security guard. On an overcast day in June, Dave Portnoy, Barstool’s wiry, 40-year-old founder — known to followers as El Presidente — stood shirtless in front of a green screen rapping, trying to recreate an Instagram video LeBron James had posted from the gym. At the other end of the office, a gaggle of dudes in impressively obscure jerseys hyped up a one-on-one basketball game between two bloggers called Smitty and Gay Pat. I sat down next to Noah Ives, a pale, slightly hunched intern, who was 21 and recently graduated from a communications program at Syracuse University. In decades past, Ives might have spent his summers at ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Conn., coiling wires and fetching coffee. \"ESPN was definitely on my mind when I got to college,\" he told me. \"But Barstool is just a cooler brand that people my age just respect more.\" When I asked him what he meant by \"respect,\" Ives smirked and said: \"The takes are just much more relatable. It’s like Pres says — Barstool is by the common man, for the common man.\" He paused before adding: \"ESPN is just spitting facts and political correctness.\" Ives spoke the language of the culture war raging in sports media — a mix of marketing jargon and Bannon-lite populism directed, at all times, at the self-proclaimed Worldwide Leader in Sports, which stands accused of losing touch with the young bros whose attention it once owned. This is surely part of why, early this fall, ESPN announced \"Barstool Van Talk,\" a half-hour talk show that would air at 1 a.m. on a secondary channel and feature two of Barstool Sports’s most palatable personalities: Consciously or not, the network wanted to co-opt the resistance. But the day before the Oct. 17 premiere of \"Van Talk,\" Sam Ponder, host of ESPN’s \"Sunday N.F.L. Countdown,\" tweeted \"Welcome to the ESPN family\" to one of the show’s hosts — along with two screen captures of a Barstool blog post from 2014, in which Portnoy called her a \"Bible-thumping freak\" and wrote that her job’s \"#1 requirement\" was to \"make men hard.\" Other outlets, like USA Today’s For the Win blog, surfaced audio from a Barstool show in which Portnoy calls on Ponder to be more \"slutty.\" Just six days after the first episode aired, John Skipper, ESPN’s president, announced the cancellation of the show in a P.R. statement. \"I erred,\" he wrote, \"in assuming we could distance our efforts from the Barstool site and its content.\" The cancellation sparked joy in sports media’s more progressive ranks, which tend to view Barstool with the same disdain that their colleagues in political news might view Breitbart or The Daily Caller. Skipper’s statement was, however, paying Portnoy a kind of compliment. Only two years ago, any business that wanted to partner with Barstool knew it would be partnering with the unfiltered chauvinism that made Portnoy a minor celebrity in Boston, his hometown. Now the president of the biggest sports network in the world was admitting that he had believed there was a way to temper Barstool for a mainstream market. \"Once upon a time, they\" — ESPN — \"were the coolest people in the room,\" said Richard Deitsch, a media columnist for Sports Illustrated, in a podcast discussing the controversy. \"That’s not the case in 2017. It’s the opposite. They are polarizing; people dislike them on all sides.\" By partnering with Barstool, he said, they were trying \"to associate themselves with who they believe are the cool kids in the room.\" Portnoy says he doesn’t really think ESPN’s future depends on the implied politics of its on-air personalities, but he knows a branding opportunity when he sees one. And the entrenched narrative — that the once-irreverent network has fed its soul to the hounds of political correctness and liberal fake news — is certainly an opportunity. As professional athletes have knelt for the national anthem, criticized the president and railed against police violence, ESPN has been repeatedly accused of being too sympathetic to them and too liberal for its own good. A company once built on an aggressively apolitical foundation has somehow become a locus of almost every imaginable type of political fight. As it has blundered its way through widely publicized incidents like Jemele Hill’s tweets about the president and the N.F.L., the sports-radio host Clay Travis has taken to calling the network \"MSESPN\"; the reporter Britt McHenry has suggested that she was fired from the network for professing her conservative beliefs. Whether these critiques are accurate seems largely irrelevant. Neither does it particularly matter that Portnoy and his cast of bloggers are largely liberal-leaning dudes from the breeding grounds of the coastal elite. There exists a swarm of angry sports fans who maintain that they do not want to talk about Colin Kaepernick or the national anthem, and Barstool has cleared a space for them to gather and talk, mostly, about just how much they don’t want to talk about politics. They claim to be an overlooked majority — the vast market inefficiency that will richly reward anyone who will let them watch their games, memes and funny videos without having to feel bad about themselves. Barstool is their safe space. So on a balmy day in October, Portnoy — who looks like Mark Zuckerberg after five years of hard drinking and even harder tanning — called an \"emergency press conference\" in his offices to address the cancellation of \"Van Talk.\" Portnoy’s addresses to readers tend to ramble and veer off on tangents, but they do so triumphantly. This one was no different: He sidled up to a makeshift lectern made out of a water jug, stared straight into a camera and delivered an unapologetic seven-minute rant. \"We’re not going to let Mickey Mouse push us around,\" he said, referring to Disney, which owns ESPN. \"There is actually nothing that ESPN could have done to illustrate\" — he meant better illustrate — \"why we are rising and they are falling.\" El Presidente, who grew up in Swampscott, Mass., an upper-middle-class suburb, isn’t the most obvious choice for a champion of the common man, but he does describe his own life as thoroughly, unceasingly average. He says he did O.K. in school and was an O.K. baseball player. He considers himself an average-looking guy. He attended the University of Michigan, where, he says, he had average fun with his average friends. His rise to prominence came not from his skills as a sports analyst but from his ability to sniff out untapped markets. After graduating from Michigan in 1999, he worked in the sales department of a consulting firm in Boston but quickly tired of corporate life. He wanted to start his own business, preferably in the gambling scene. In 2003, on a trip to Las Vegas, he met with people in the online-gaming industry and found them desperate for places to advertise. Portnoy’s idea was to start a sports publication that might be attractive to poker advertisers — and because the only ad model that seemed viable at the time was in print, he planned to pass it out as a tabloid at T stops throughout Boston. Early in the decade, the only sports blogs with any significant audience were Sports by Brooks — which mostly aggregated news — and the writer Bill Simmons’s column on AOL’s Digital City Boston. (I later worked for Simmons for three years at Grantland, the ESPN website where he was editor in chief.) Portnoy revered Simmons and agreed with his assessment that Boston’s sports coverage, which was still centered in the column inches of The Globe and The Herald, had grown stale and out of touch with the common man. Not so for Portnoy: In an early mock-up, calling himself Devilfish Dave, he wrote that \"the people at Barstool Sports are a bunch of average Joes, who like most guys love sports, gambling, golfing and chasing short skirts.\" Barstool went through the usual spate of early hardships, and there’s every chance that had it been born out of some actual journalistic ideal, it would have folded within the year. But Portnoy’s talent was for gathering feedback from readers and advertisers and tweaking his product accordingly: \"We could pivot really easily,\" he told me, \"and chase money.\" The first breakthrough came when a local photographer told Portnoy he should start putting photos of area women on the tabloid’s covers — and offered to take the pictures himself. (A version of this idea still exists on the website, under the title \"Local Smokeshow of the Day.\") Around the same time, Portnoy noticed that readers seemed to respond more to stories about drinking, women and gambling than day-to-day sports news. He sold ads to bars and breweries and catered more and more to a certain archetypal Boston bro — the type who puts on a collared shirt to get blackout drunk every weekend while ruefully cheering on the Red Sox. His writing voice fell into a distinct rhythm, half-cocked and prone to fits of anger. When he finally mustered up a web version of Barstool, it looked like a relic from the 1990s and often crashed, but he called such inconveniences \"the Barstool difference\" — a sign, he maintained, of true authenticity. By the time Barstool began publishing, Simmons had started a national column for ESPN and moved to Los Angeles to write for television. Portnoy had Boston to himself. \"When Bill was writing on Digital Cities, he was reaching regular guys like me,\" Portnoy told me. \"I’m reaching the new me.\" Whether he knew it or not, Portnoy was also building a modern online-media business well before its time — with low overhead, an investment in brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams that could withstand fluctuations in advertising. He started hawking T-shirts and merchandise on the site, another venture that fell prey to the Barstool difference; printing and shipping could take months. He built up a network of bloggers in other cities, like Dan Katz in Chicago and Kevin Clancy in New York — Big Cat and KFC, per their Barstool nicknames. When Portnoy realized that readers were more invested in these bloggers as personalities than in their opinions on sports, he began turning the site into a sort of online reality show: Every office argument and personal-life development was written up and fed to a growing legion of \"Stoolies.\" Part of what Barstool offered these readers was escapism, something that retains a lot of power among sports fans who still see games as a nightly release from their responsibilities. The site’s enduring slogan, \"Saturdays Are for the Boys,\" promises a day free from girlfriends and wives. Search for the phrase on social media, and you’ll find videos of Stoolies relaxing at beach houses, on boats or at tailgates, surrounded by nothing but shirtless men; in some, they actually push women out of the camera’s frame. Sports could also be a reprieve from office work. In his initial mock-up, in 2003, Portnoy wrote that \"we don’t take ourselves very seriously and view working at Barstool Sports as a way to avoid becoming slaves to cubicle life.\" When Clancy, who calls himself \"the king of average,\" started writing Barstool New York, he was working as an accountant at Deloitte; when he saw that his tales of mind-numbing corporate boredom were getting traction with readers, he began writing a column called \"Cubicle Chronicles,\" grumbling rancorously about everything from bad coffee to the \"fat secretary blasting Dominic the [expletive] Donkey\" around Christmas. The only thing the Stoolies wouldn’t do, it turned out, was \"politics.\" For the most part, Portnoy and his readers employed the time-honored bro tactic of saying they had no problem with anyone — until, of course, \"anyone\" started complaining. A particularly illustrative example of this can be found in an article from 2009, in which a reader informed Portnoy about the \"Fagbug,\" an art installation aimed at raising awareness about homophobic violence. \"I could give a [expletive] less if somebody is gay or not,\" Portnoy responded, insisting that, much as he enjoyed the female anatomy, if another man preferred the male one, then \"more power to him.\" But what, he asked, was the point of the installation? \"I thought gay dudes hated being called fags? Or is this like when a black person uses the N-word as a compliment?\" He closed by saying all this \"fag talk\" reminded him of last night’s television: Did anyone else see Adam Lambert on \"American Idol\"? Every line was aimed directly at dudes who, like Portnoy, would not identify as bigots, but who also scratched their heads at the weird tendencies of anyone who wasn’t exactly like them, self-proclaimed common men. By 2010, Barstool was doing well enough that Portnoy had an office in Milton, Mass., local pages for New York, Chicago and Philadelphia and a handful of employees, including the future YouTube megastar Jenna Mourey, a.k.a. Jenna Marbles. That year, he hired a local white rapper named Sammy Adams and set up a tour of New England colleges. \"When we showed up on the campuses, they had our signs on their dorms, people were rushing after our bus,\" he told me. \"That was the first time I really thought this might be bigger than I anticipated.\" The following year, he started a nationwide party tour called \"Barstool Blackout.\" The college students who attended danced under blacklights and occasionally — the obvious implication — drank until they blacked out. (One of the slogans: \"By the C- student, for the C- student.\") It was Barstool’s first real encounter with controversy. Early in 2012, students in the Boston area demonstrated against the Blackout Parties, claiming that they promoted rape culture and circulating Portnoy’s writings on the subject. \"Just to make friends with the feminists,\" he’d written on the site, \"I’d like to reiterate that we don’t condone rape of any kind at our Blackout Parties in mid-January. However, if a chick passes out, that’s a gray area though.\" And: \"Though I never condone rape, if you’re a Size 6 and you’re wearing skinny jeans, you kind of deserve to be raped, right?\" The parties, which were held at private spaces near campuses, went ahead as planned. Portnoy issued no retractions or apologies. \"I think the controversy probably helped us,\" he says now. \"Our fans liked that we didn’t back down. They realized that I was on their side.\" In January 2016, Portnoy stood in Times Square, dressed in a tuxedo and flanked by Clancy, Katz and a Barstool editor, Keith Markovich. After a few bars of Frank Sinatra’s \"New York, New York,\" he made what he called a \"shocking\" announcement: \"I am no longer the majority owner of Barstool Sports. We have taken investment from an investment company called Chernin Digital.\" He went on to describe Peter Chernin — head of the Chernin Group, the former president of News Corporation and the Fox film executive who greenlit \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\" — as a \"big swinging [expletive] at the cracker factory,\" and alluded to Barstool’s business and technological shortcomings, all of which would presumably be fixed soon. \"When you’re a young comedian in the ’80s,\" he said, \"and you graduate, right, you had to send your résumé to ‘S.N.L.’ Five years, all these little kids, all these beautiful people — there’s only going to be one place to send their résumé: Barstool Sports.\" In a blog post about the sale — which concluded with the coy signoff \"PS — I’m kinda rich now\" — Portnoy added something prescient: \"Chernin knows about the Size 6 skinny-jean joke. They know about Babygate.\" (The \"Babygate\" controversy stemmed from Portnoy’s speculating about the size of Tom Brady’s baby’s penis.) \"They know about Al Jazeera.\" (In this one, Clancy questioned the legitimacy of any news outlet with an Arabic-sounding name.) \"They get it.\" The Barstool acquisition was engineered by the president of Chernin Digital, Mike Kerns. \"When I got access to Barstool’s Google analytics, I knew this was something different,\" he told me. \"They had something like 20 percent of their visitors coming back about 20 times a day. I’ve been in this business for two decades, and all their numbers bucked the usual trends.\" Portnoy kept full editorial control; Chernin’s bet was that it could serve cheap content to his loyal fan base, which would then pay for things like T-shirts, events and premium content. The brand would be scaled up into something that could be sold to advertisers, big media partners and even sports leagues. Every Barstool executive I spoke to mentioned the possibility of opening branded sports bars across the country; all of them talked about partnerships with networks. Since its acquisition, Barstool has released a raft of popular podcasts — including \"Pardon My Take,\" which, with downloads running up to one million per episode, is one of the biggest sports podcasts in the country. It has partnered with Facebook on a roving pregame college-football show (since canceled) and produced a widely watched baseball show that regularly features former major-league players. This bullish transition has been helmed by Erika Nardini, a 42-year-old former marketing executive who once served as the chief marketing officer for AOL. Nardini, who grew up playing sports with her younger brother, seems uniquely qualified to deal with both the business of turning Barstool into a national brand and the inevitable public- and human-relations disasters that will arise along the way. She is also a woman, and despite its growth since the Chernin acquisition, Barstool still has to work around how bad its worst moments can get — from Portnoy’s rape jokes to posts like the one a blogger named Chris Spagnuolo wrote this summer: \"Is Rihanna Going to Make Being Fat the Hot New Trend?\" The Rihanna incident highlighted how much has changed since the Chernin acquisition, but also how much has stayed more or less the same. The post was quietly taken down. But Portnoy also opined on the site that he thought the post wasn’t \"as bad as many are making it out to be,\" and that he was angry mostly because Spagnuolo had given \"feminists\" fodder to say \"there goes Barstool being Barstool again.\" And yet Portnoy himself cannot seem to stop personally offering up more and more of that fodder. A controversy last month, involving the terms of a contract offered to a sports personality named Elika Sadeghi, began on relatively professional footing. Within days, though, Barstool had released a seven-minute animated video in which a cartoon Portnoy says Sadeghi’s surname sounds like \"the monkey from ‘The Lion King.’\\u2009\" It also portrays her hanging upside down over a boiling caldron. I spoke to several women in sports media who have had run-ins with Barstool. All described the same pattern: They would tweet something critical of Barstool’s statements about women, which would prompt a response from Portnoy or one of his bloggers. Then came the swarm of Stoolies on social media, who would harass them with misogynist slurs and threats, often for days. Even random sports fans have been targeted. A few years ago, a Cubs fan named Missy suffered a brain injury after a fall; during her recovery, she found that she had trouble reading anything longer than a paragraph, so she moved her usual sports-media consumption over to Twitter. When she saw an article detailing the way Clancy and an army of Stoolies had responded to the Al Jazeera incident, Missy tweeted her support for the author of the article and women she felt had been abused online. Stoolies responded almost immediately, with three days of the usual misogynist epithets and vague threats. A year later, she says, after another comment critical of Barstool, a reader found photos she had posted memorializing a cousin who died of cancer — and reposted them on Twitter, tagging Barstool writers to do God knows what with them. There’s a uniform response from Barstool employees about the worst of the Stoolies. \"I hate seeing it,\" Katz told me. \"But it’s just a few idiots who have nothing better to do, and it sucks that people use them to smear an entire company.\" The average Stoolie, Portnoy, Clancy and Markovich all argue, is not a misogynist abuser but has been painted with a broad brush by other media outlets. \"I’m used to it by now,\" Nardini said of the constant negative press surrounding Barstool’s attitudes toward women. \"Every time anyone mentions us in the media, they’re always going to write that requisite paragraph.\" She used to be part of a network of female executives, she told me, but \"after they heard I was coming here, every single one of them dropped me like a bad habit.\" The wrath of the Stoolies can occasionally extend to Barstool’s own employees. \"There wasn’t a single day that would go by without me seeing the N-word in the comments,\" Maurice Peebles, Barstool’s first black employee, told me. Peebles ran Barstool’s Philadelphia page for three years. His administrator access allowed him to see that the racial slurs were coming mostly from a concentrated number of IP addresses, which meant that only a few readers were posting the slurs, and over time the site’s filters became better at blocking them. But he doesn’t absolve Barstool of all responsibility. \"They could’ve done more about it,\" he says. \"None of the guys who worked at Barstool ever said anything racist to me, but I don’t know if they all understand what it’s like to see that word every day.\" Barstool’s reputation \"was certainly listed as a risk,\" Kerns says. \"But I think time is on our side. The younger folks within agencies and brands get Barstool and recognize the world is increasingly taking itself less seriously.\" Over the past year, that time seemed to have already arrived. Dunkin’ Donuts, the advertiser most associated with Boston sports, had long been wary of dealing with Portnoy, but this year, Barstool dedicated an entire month to promoting the chain’s new energy drink. Wendy’s had also expressed hesitation to partner with Barstool, but this summer the company sponsored \"Barstool 5th Year,\" a Snapchat channel specifically targeted at college students. The question of whether Barstool should be held responsible for the worst behaviors of its fans reflects a fundamental question facing online media — the same one at the core of Facebook’s issues with fake news, Twitter’s with neo-Nazis and Reddit’s with various toxic communities. Unlike those companies, Barstool can’t hide behind the notion of being an open, neutral platform for the free speech of others. Its readers may come from all sorts of backgrounds, but the core Stoolies are an organic online community that grew under the caring, thoughtful hand of their very own El Presidente. Every new-media venture seeks out an \"organic online community\" like this — one that can, in Nardini’s words, \"convert content into commerce.\" That community could mean, say, subscribers of The Daily Skimm, an email for millennial women that recaps the news in a peppy, corporate voice. But it can also mean tribes of angry, disaffected young men who gather online to find shelter from the floodwaters of political correctness. This leaves companies like ESPN with a discomforting dilemma. Should they try to create their own communities — an almost impossible enterprise, especially with young audiences who have grown up on completely independent, unfiltered personalities on YouTube and social media? Or should they co-opt, sanitize and scale audiences like the Stoolies? There are two distinct visions of how Barstool could work at the scale Nardini and Chernin envision. The first would involve running back into the understanding embrace of the Stoolies and building an uncouth, unapologetic brand aimed exclusively at boorish young men. Last August, Barstool purchased Old Row, a site that posts frat-boy fight videos and photos of college girls in bikinis and sells T-shirts celebrating the Trump presidency. This month, Barstool announced that it had bought Rough N Rowdy Brawl, an amateur boxing company from West Virginia that features untrained locals knocking one another out. In an \"emergency press conference\" announcing the acquisition, Portnoy thanked Ponder, saying the ESPN controversy had led to \"the biggest couple weeks we’ve ever had.\" \"It does not matter if you like us, hate us, whatever,\" he said. \"We speak directly to our own consumers.\" The other road is to take the popular material that has been built since the Chernin acquisition and take another crack at entering media’s mainstream. I have friends and relatives — the majority of whom would be considered progressive, many of whom are not white — who read Barstool regularly, like its videos on Instagram and listen to \"Pardon My Take.\" Some are vaguely aware that Portnoy has said disturbing things about women, but they shrug it off in the same way they shrug off the cloud of bad news that continually engulfs the N.F.L. The vast majority of the Barstool content they consume ticks between standard-fare aggregation (funny videos, memes, weird stories from Florida) and genuinely enjoyable content aimed directly at men who, like me, grew up watching sports and went to colleges where we watched sports with our sports-watching friends. During the N.H.L. finals in June, I went to the Barstool offices to watch a recording of \"Pardon My Take.\" Katz, who is not as fat as he claims to be on air, sat in a La-Z-Boy, idly watching hockey and scribbling notes. His co-host, who goes by the pseudonym PFT Commenter, tried out jokes about handshake lines and the superiority of the N.H.L. to the N.B.A. When the game ended, they settled on a list of segments and piled into a small recording studio, completely bare except for poorly stapled acoustic tiles and posters of Chris Berman and Lenny Dykstra. They rattled through the show without second takes or pauses, the jokes and banter falling into a familiar, rapid rhythm. Katz is the straight man; he is mostly playing himself, an affable dude who loves his Chicago sports and could easily slide into the chair of any ESPN opinion show. PFT Commenter, who has shoulder-length hair and wears Hawaiian shirts, has created a type of character that has never really been seen in sports media — a gag version of a commenter on the well-trafficked N.F.L. blog Pro Football Talk, his tweets and columns filled with the spelling errors, prejudices and leaps of logic that plague all open forums about sports. In 2015, covering the early part of the presidential campaign, in character, for SB Nation, he would pound airplane bottles of Fireball whiskey and walk straight into scrums of reporters; outside a Republican debate in Cleveland, he held up a sign behind Chris Matthews that read, \"Is Joe Flacco a ELITE Quaterback?\" Almost everything about \"Pardon My Take\" is a densely referential sports-fan in-joke. Even the title plays off two ESPN talk shows, \"Pardon the Interruption\" and \"First Take.\" If you’ve never watched Chris Berman run through a highlight reel or admired the sports-yelling talents of Stephen A. Smith, Katz and Commenter might as well be speaking a foreign language. But most sports fans have watched hundreds of hours of ESPN programming, absorbing all the tics, clichés and motifs that Katz and Commenter have quilted together into a pitch-perfect satirical pidgin. One of its catchiest elements derives from the N.F.L.-coach habit of explaining some bit of masculine bluster by saying \"I’m a football guy\" — in my time at Barstool, at least 70 percent of conversations seemed to include some deadpan variation on \"I’m a huge [something] guy.\" This entertaining mix has attracted an impressive list of high-profile athletes and media figures to the show. Before the Chernin deal, Portnoy had not seen the value in producing podcasts, which he admitted to me was a \"big mistake\"; now \"Pardon My Take\" is Barstool’s flagship product. Katz and Commenter were, until October, proof that Barstool could be scrubbed clean and scaled up. During our conversations, Portnoy kept bringing up \"Saturday Night Live,\" mentioning it as a model for Barstool. What he meant was that he wanted to create a broad cast of characters, each capable of his or her own independent success. Barstool has hired the ESPN sideline reporter Julie Stewart-Binks; Michael Rapaport, the character actor who hosts a popular podcast; the former major-league pitcher Dallas Braden; Pat McAfee, an N.F.L. punter who retired midcareer to sign with Portnoy; and Adam Ferrone, a battle-rap champion who told me that he pestered Barstool for two years for a job. By choosing Barstool, each seems to be signing on with the gospel of Portnoy: Say what’s on your mind — and if anyone has a problem with it, fight back. The morning after Skipper sent out the ESPN memo canceling \"Van Talk,\" I met Portnoy in his hoarder’s den of an office, where Tom Brady memorabilia and stacks of paper occupied every surface. He seemed unusually subdued. His nearly manic manner had dissipated into a fog of half-formed sound bites and what felt like sincere anxiety. He expressed regret over hurting Katz and Commenter’s television prospects, denounced ESPN’s cowardice and called out the hypocrisy of any female journalist at ESPN who had ever tweeted an edgy joke in the past. \"I used to think of Barstool like a comedy club,\" he said. \"Just me talking to my guys. But things have definitely changed.\" Then, after a pause, he seemed to have a change of heart: \"ESPN thought they were going to get Barstool without Barstool. How does that even work?\" Over the days to come, Portnoy and a handful of bloggers — alongside hundreds of Stoolie volunteers — scrubbed through the social-media accounts of women at ESPN who had spoken out about them, resurfacing every comment that was even slightly off-color. (\"I hate hypocrisy,\" Portnoy told me — and that image, of ugly honesty triumphing over hypocrisy, probably explains Barstool’s appeal to young men better than any of its content.) A week later, Henry Lockwood, the producer of \"Pardon My Take,\" tweeted that Britt McHenry had \"cankles,\" leading to another spat. It was as if Barstool was doubling down on being more Barstool than ever, even though ESPN wasn’t the only partner that had been scared off: Portnoy told me another network had backed away from a deal, and that some advertisers had expressed concern. We talked about something that happened a few hours before ESPN’s announcement, while Portnoy was recording one of his daily pizza reviews — a Barstool programming staple in which Portnoy tries to review every pizza joint in Manhattan. That day, his guest was Jake Paul, the 20-year-old YouTube heel who might be the only person on the internet better than Portnoy at turning hate and controversy into merchandising opportunities. \"People know I’m a Jake Paul guy,\" Portnoy said. \"I respect people who take over the internet, and this guy has got maybe more haters than I do, which I also love.\" He ventured that \"if you put Team 10\" — the name of Paul’s company — \"with the Stoolies, I think we can bring down, like, the entire country.\" He was joking, but if companies like ESPN want to corral the millions of young people who have cut cable cords, turned off \"SportsCenter\" and flocked to unfiltered and anarchic internet personalities, they will have to reckon with Jake Pauls and Dave Portnoys. The truth about ESPN’s supposed bias will not really matter: A lot of people, like Ives the intern, believe that the Worldwide Leader in Sports no longer speaks to them. Their grievances, like those of the angry men who fume over the female cast of \"Ghostbusters\" or ethics in video-game journalism, will seem absurdly petty, whether they’re complaining about the rare yet somehow oppressive sight of a female sportscaster or the unbearable burden placed upon their consciences by a two-minute conversation about Colin Kaepernick. But they will voice these grievances online with enough volume and vitriol to worry even the most reasonable media executive. And if that executive doesn’t bend to their will, they will seek out someone, anyone, who feels more authentic to their experience, whatever that may mean. For huge media conglomerates, this dynamic might matter only in the margins; ESPN surely has more immediate business concerns. But gains in media right now occur only in the margins. The market inefficiencies will not be ignored. In his office, I asked Portnoy why he thought ESPN had been interested in partnering with Barstool in the first place, given its past. A half-smile crept over his face. \"You know, it’s like that Batman quote,\" he said. \"In a time of desperation, you turn to a man you don’t fully understand.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/magazine/spurned-by-espn-barstool-sports-is-staying-on-offense.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Three Gorgeous Cakes for the Holidays', 'text': ' Every family has its own sequence of nonnegotiable desserts during the holidays, and for mine, it’s a series of cakes. There is, without fail, a reliable slab of sticky toffee, packed with mashed, rehydrated dates, zapped under the broiler until its sauce of brown sugar and cream is bubbling furiously all along the top. My mother makes it, or I do, or my brother does. It doesn’t make a difference, because we all make it the same way. Then we eat it warm, with extra sauce on the side, picking back up on our endless conversation about the next day’s food plans, and the next day’s cake. No matter how late the night, how big the dinner, how jet-lagged the out-of-town uncles and aunties, when a cake comes out, there’s a communal surge in appetite and spirits. Everyone has room for at least one piece. A cake is how we mark the rareness, the specialness, of time off in one another’s company. This time of year, I’m eager to show my family that I care about them, to make them something delicious, but also, if I’m being honest, to take the occasional break from them. I make a sticky toffee cake by heart, but then I’m drawn in by grander, more complicated cakes, by layered, frosted, patterned projects that reward my time and attention. Much like my family, baking is both a remedy for my stress and a source of it. My earliest understanding of this goes back to Anne Shirley, of \"Anne of Green Gables,\" who at one point in the novel is sitting in the twilight of Prince Edward Island, goofing around with her best friend. She has plans to make a cake for guests the next day — fun! — but no, the task is giving her nightmares, visions of goblins, premonitions of disaster. \"I just grow cold when I think of my layer cake,\" Anne says. \"Cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad, just when you especially want them to be good.\" This is a piece of well-established cake logic, familiar to anyone who has baked for a special occasion, and no one illustrated it better than Lucy Maud Montgomery, who wrote \"Anne\" more than 100 years ago. Though I never made the same mistake as Anne (swapping in a disgusting-tasting medicine for vanilla), I was responsible for all kinds of bad cakes when I first started baking as a child, reckless and unsupervised. There were warped, sloping cakes, speckled all over with hard pebbles of unsifted cocoa. There were inexplicably dense, flabby and elastic cakes, some still trembling and raw at the center, or a bit too browned at the edges, or forgotten and burned, or stuck tight in an unlined, ungreased pan, scratched out and served in crumbling pieces. There was the occasional pretty cake, too, but it would be crushed in the fridge by a toppling container of leftovers, or balanced on the narrow sill of an open kitchen window (because isn’t that what they did in cartoons?) and demolished by the dog. The edible cakes would be cheered, regardless of how they looked, sliced and shared, gone by the end of the day. After I worked in restaurant kitchens, I learned to be more careful and precise, archiving all the tactile and visual reference points that would work like cues. I became good enough, at least, that I was enlisted to make birthday cakes for my friends. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that I became obsessed with a single-subject Tumblr account at this exact time. The site, called Doom Cakes, cataloged cakes that cast long, dark, menacing shadows in films like \"The Birds\" and \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.\" While I waited for yellow layers to cool in their tins, I’d watch Matthew McConaughey in a shiny waistcoat, struggling to hold up a structurally unsound four-tier wedding cake, and failing. The intricately decorated layers would splatter, finally, in extravagant chaos. Genre didn’t matter. In animation, thrillers and romantic comedies, a cake was vulnerable, and usually a sign of imminent disaster. These horrifying clips should have put me off, or slowed me down, but instead they propelled me to attempt more and more complicated techniques, and produce more elaborate cakes. A classic Opera cake for my mother’s birthday at home, the almond layers soaked in a boozy coffee syrup. A strawberry-and-cream sandwich built in an acetate-lined ring, carried to friends in Prospect Park on a dangerously warm day. I took a thick roll of spongecake filled with yuzu curd to my boyfriend’s father in the hospital and left it on a plastic folding table with a note, and built a wobbly whirly-domed charlotte that was grotesquely beautiful, serving it after a lunch at home of salad and fried chicken. At a friend’s apartment in Brooklyn, I glazed a sheet cake layered with mint buttercream and chocolate ganache, piping tiny, unnecessary patterns all over it out of melted dark chocolate. What I found was that I baked well with a shiver of dread, that I liked the feeling of rushing ahead without knowing with any certainty that everything would turn out all right. Dread motivated me in the kitchen, in the same way a looming deadline motivated me at my laptop. When two of my closest friends in New York married, they didn’t ask me to make the cake, but they did give me the navy blue stand mixer they received as a wedding present. Before that, I did everything by hand, switching arms when I got tired, or turning to an ancient, wheezing electric whisk that would bend if it met cold butter and whir to a halt after a minute or two. The stand mixer made me feel superhuman, taking over all the hard work of creaming fats and sugars, whisking stiff meringues, mixing boiling hot sugar syrups into buttercream. I still feel mildly anxious about making a beautiful cake, though it’s not necessary: If you read recipes a few times before you start, a cake is not, in fact, a mysterious adventure, revealing itself in snippets as you go. If it has been some time since you last baked, you can make sure you have all the ingredients ahead of time, and check the levels in your tin of baking powder and your pan sizes. The things that seem obvious now didn’t always. I occasionally take the temperature of my oven, to make sure it matches up with what’s on the dial (it usually doesn’t, and I adjust accordingly). I buy rolls of parchment paper to line the bottom of every pan. I use a digital scale and weigh everything out before I start. I let cakes cool, completely, before cutting or frosting them. All year long, I’ve baked cakes I’ve read about on blogs and in books, and found my way to some favorites. A gingerbread cake, full of spice and warmth, doesn’t always need a frosting, Genevieve Ko reminded me. She makes a version with spelt flour and rehydrated prunes, hot with ginger, cinnamon and clove, and finishes it with a dusting of cocoa powder. It’s excellent right away, particularly light and tender and full of flavor, but it seemed to get even more mellow on Day 2. It came together quickly and required no decorating, simply taking on the curves of the Bundt pan. Helen Goh and Yotam Ottolenghi’s lemon cake, frosted with black-currant buttercream, had been in the back of my mind since this past summer. It looked simple enough, but cut open, revealed several bright vertical layers, like a kind of magic trick. The technique was unusual — instead of making a long, skinny jellyroll out of the large sponge, they cut the cake into three pieces, connecting them to make one shorter, thicker roll, and then sitting it upright. I followed the recipe at home, amazed. By then it was fall, so I replaced the black currants with frozen cranberries, and the tart frosting turned a beautiful shade of pink. Few recipe writers are as precise as Stella Parks, a former pastry chef whose instructions always fill me with a sense of clearheaded confidence. The batter for her devil’s-food cake comes together in a single pot, without any special equipment. But to call it a dump-it cake would be a kind of disservice: It bakes into an exceptional, sturdy but somehow very tender chocolate cake, buttery with a soft edge of bitterness. Stacked in three layers, covered with a thick meringue frosting, then torched like a giant marshmallow, it’s one of those cakes that defines the genre of showstopper. I anticipate all kinds of minor catastrophes when my family gets together. I always do. This year, none of them have anything to do with cake. — When I first started baking in Melbourne, I made a simple chocolate cake, and it ended up on the front page of the weekend paper with the headline \"World’s Best Chocolate Cake.\" From then on, I had this cult following, and in a way, it was a lot of pressure. I didn’t have much experience, but it spurred me on to live up to this reputation. I still have my practice as a psychologist in London; I also develop cakes for Ottolenghi, Yotam’s cafes in London. These have to be visually appealing, cut neatly and keep well in the window, because it’s an unrefrigerated counter. When Yotam rang me up, saying we needed more color in our cookbook, I had the idea that the best way to get color into a cake would be fruit. (My mother used to say, \"Fruit is God’s candy.\") I had seen a vertical-stripe technique before, and it isn’t difficult to do, once you get your head around it. The thing with this spongecake is to separate the yolks and whites. The meringue uses a little sugar, because if you whip it without sugar, it gets airy and dry. With sugar, you get a very glossy, slightly denser meringue, and when you fold it into the batter, it doesn’t break down as much. It’s strong but light, and still airy from the meringue. It’s quite a rich cake to eat. When you roll it up, sometimes the seam finishes really neatly, and sometimes it doesn’t, depending on the exact pan size you use. But I don’t worry about it too much: The buttercream covers it all up. — I’ve been making cakes since I was a child; we had a babysitter who would come over to the house with a box of cake mix and a tub of frosting, and we had a blast making cakes. By the time I was 9 or 10, I was ready to graduate from a mix and make them myself. I got super into it, and I made my first wedding cake, for money, at 16. I can remember the sheer terror of delivering it: My dad drove, and I was allowed to sit on the floor of the van with the cake, unbuckled, in case the layers moved around. This was what led me to culinary school, to a baking-and-pastry program, to restaurants. I thought, I want to really figure this out, because this is so fun I could do it forever. Historically, a devil’s-food cake would have been a chocolate cake made with all butter, egg yolks, hot coffee and cocoa powder. A lot of cakes use the creaming method, because there’s so much sugar and butter that the batter is really dense, by nature. The way the ratio of mine is formulated, it’s not that dense, which means it doesn’t have the deep need for aeration that some batters do. I didn’t intend to develop a one-pot recipe, but that’s how it evolved. — I grew up in a Chinese-American family in Southern California, the first generation born here, and I didn’t taste gingerbread until well into adulthood. Both of my grandmothers lived with us — one from China and the other from Hong Kong — and they both loved sweets. As a treat, they’d offer me candied ginger, which can be hot and intense, along with many varieties of dried plums. And they’d buy cakes from Chinese bakeries, which would be very light and fluffy, not that sweet. I didn’t taste gingerbread, but I always had a fantasy of gingerbread, as a warming cake that kids ate in snowy cabins. Once I started working at American food magazines, tinkering every year with gingerbread recipes, I wished for something different, and lighter in texture. I came back to this confluence of ginger and dried plums, the flavors that had been with me my whole life. Dried plums are earthy and almost a little funky. They have a gentle tannic quality that I also find in molasses, just on the edge of bitterness, which softens the harshness of the gingerbread and gives it layers of complexity. Rehydrated, the plums make up the liquid base of the batter, which keeps the cake’s texture light. So does the spelt flour, which has a natural, round sweetness. Because it’s an oil-based cake, it stays tender for days. This is the gingerbread I was always chasing.

How does your songwriting process work? I just walk around, and I collect things. When it’s time to write, I dump them all out at the landfill and sort through them. I start grouping things by color or by texture, slowly but surely. I just made a bunch of robots out of trash: That’s what it feels like. You’ve mentioned that the artist Jenny Holzer was influential in figuring out the aesthetic of the album and the tour. In a lot of ways. I called the tour \"Fear the Future,\" because it made me laugh — it’s so ominous and prescriptive that it’s absurd. It reminded me of the big, bold edicts that Jenny Holzer would have superimposed on a building or a billboard, or of the billboards that you pass in the South: \"JESUS IS COMING SOON\" or something else apocalyptic. It just made me laugh. Does it make you laugh when you see it now? Yes, but I think everyone’s in on the joke. It reminds me a bit of Kraftwerk. I’ll take that. This is a much more straightforward pop album than your previous works. Did you consciously try to go in a new direction? I knew that I wanted programmed drums and that I wanted pedal steel and that I wanted to write about power. How much did the current social climate affect you? I was very affected — as everyone is, or was. We’re staring into the face of annihilation — what are we going to do? Blink? I was ruminating on sex and power and seduction and then thinking about something William S. Burroughs once said to the singer Genesis P-Orridge of Psychic TV: \"Your task, Genesis, is to short-circuit control.\" I would happily stand and be counted to be one of those, helping dismantle the power structure as it is. I think we’re going to see a really massive and exciting sea change toward more justice and more equality for the most marginalized. I did not start out to write a \"political\" album, because, frankly, I’m not convinced those work. The way to hearts and minds is to be honest about your own heart and mind, but my person is politicized as a result of the time we’re living in. You can’t help but be political. There’s a striking promotional image of you at a lectern and all the microphones, which seems a little political. I do so many things because I think they’re funny or ridiculous. It felt so absurd to do a lot of pomp and circumstance about announcing an album, so part of that was being absurd and self-effacing too. It’s dismantling the pretension of having an album but also poking fun at the imperious cult-leader kind of imagery of the last record. I wanted to be a little bit sillier with the presentation of it. Like, how can you be sexy \"Pee-wee’s Playhouse\"? How can it be sexy but totally absurd and self-aware and menacing? The cover image is very sexy and menacing: There’s a woman bent over and stuck in a wall. After the flood of stories of sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood, I’ve been thinking about whether, say, a disembodied butt can be an image of power. Do you take people’s reactions to statements like this as a litmus test? Not really. I’m not necessarily trying to be provocative. My reality of what’s been funny or acceptable or normal is different from other people’s. I’m not necessarily thinking, What’s going to get people riled in any way, shape or form? Though I’m happy for people to write a thesis unpacking it, I really just go off instinct. Is this intriguing to me? Is this funny to me? How does this make me feel? Maybe it’ll make other people feel that way. Have you had to answer a lot of questions about whose butt it is? It’s my friend Carlotta. She’s super beautiful and really smart and very strange, and she has a great ass.

THE KARDASHIANS An American Drama By Jerry Oppenheimer336 pp. St. Martin’s Press. $27.99. There are those who have fame thrust upon them, and those who thrust themselves upon fame like an invasion force. It is the latter troupe of shameless, relentless thrusters that occupies us here, the Trump and Kardashian clanships. Until fairly recently, family dynasties — whatever skeletons they may have had in their closets — thrived on a mantle of achievement handed down from generation to generation, whether we’re talking about the Adamses, Roosevelts, Rockefellers, Kennedys, Bushes or Flying Wallendas. Such a quaint ideal and needless effort this service obligation seems now, when exhibitionism in the pseudoraw is what gets rewarded, thanks in large measure to the phony theatrics of reality TV, which turned the social theorist Daniel Boorstin’s notion of a celebrity — someone famous for being famous — into a terrarium thronged with dance moms, mob wives and Honey Boo Boos. It has elevated into omnipresence those who would have otherwise played out a normal cycle in public awareness and then disappeared to pester us no more. Without \"The Apprentice\" and its successor, \"The Celebrity Apprentice,\" Donald Trump would have remained an egregious real estate self-promoter and gossip-column fixture, and his children minor adjuncts and boardroom props; without \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" the brood bearing that name would have been living footnotes to the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Instead, one family wields incalculable political power, the other pervades pop culture and fashion like an incurable virus. The two books under review offer peep-show views of preening lives and impostures before they went panoramic. \"It’s so many freaking Trumps,\" marvels Ivana Trump near the end of her memoir, \"Raising Trump,\" our author glowing with maternal pride at the fruitful multiplying of the three bundles of delight she and her ex-husband Donald produced — Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric — who in turn begat nine grandchildren: \"Nine little monsters!\" A self-proclaimed \"Glam-Ma,\" Ivana did a pretty nifty job rearing the three primary heirs, if she says so herself. And she does, numerous times, taking satisfaction in not raising a dreaded Kardashian or two. Where so many spoiled-rotten brats of the superrich spiral into drug rehab, jail, divorce court or a shoddily produced sex video, the Trump children, she proclaims, grew up to be faithful spouses, superb parents, accomplished business people and sterling assets during their father’s presidential campaign. \"I believe the credit for raising such great kids belongs to me. I was in charge of raising our children before our divorce, and I had sole custody of them after the split. I made the decisions about their education, activities, travel, child care and allowances.\" The Donald, as she immortally dubbed him during their marriage, was too busy being a big shot to attend to such domestic trifles. He had casinos to open, bankruptcies to declare. \"If Donald wants to write a book about fatherhood,\" Ivana says, \"I would be happy to read it, but ‘Raising Trump’ is my story, from my perspective, about what I did, and still do, for my family.\" The title, then, is a misnomer. It should be \"Raising Trumps,\" plural. It’s a book about child-rearing, not husband-wrangling. And in this I fear Ivana has mistimed her memoir and misread the mood of the troubled country, which isn’t interested in heartwarming holiday tales, family recipes, cute anecdotes about her trying to order a glass of Chablis at a Taco Bell, tips on teaching kids manners and the grown-up kids’ rote testimonials reiterating throughout the text what a swell mom she was and is (Ivanka’s initial entry has all the warmth and personality of a ribbon-cutting ceremony). We’re past the point of indulging hokum with a high thread count. Uppermost on the reader’s inquiring mind is how Ivana’s intimate perspective might help us unlock how the slick wheeler-dealer who charmed and courted her when she arrived in Manhattan in the 1970s — \"an all-American good guy,\" her instincts told her — mutated over the decades into a president so seething with ignorance, malice, prejudice and destruction. Some hints, that is, of how we got into our present predicament of being held hostage by a throbbing blister. And here Ivana is little help whatsoever. The Trump at the center of this mystery melodrama is mostly a phantom, a fitful gust of pique and an offstage rumble. \"Raising Trump\" does offer a glimpse into the trivial tyrant power Trump’s father, Fred, exercised, expecting everyone at the lunch table to order steak after he does, miffed when Ivana alone breaks ranks and orders fish. \"No, she’ll have the steak,\" Fred tells the waiter, but Ivana holds firm. Donald doesn’t back Ivana up then or afterward, but rather is displeased that she didn’t knuckle under: \"Why didn’t you just have a friggin’ steak?\" \"Raising Trump\" also provides a window into Donald’s pettiness when he pulls on Ivanka’s ski pole during a family race down the slope in order to win — cheating to beat his own young daughter! Pranks, deceptions and convenient absences come to a head in Aspen, when a young hussy swoops down on Ivana’s restaurant table and introduces herself. \"I’m Marla and I love your husband. Do you?\" Meet Marla Maples, the mistress Ivana refers to as \"the showgirl.\" Ivana divulges nothing of what was said in the heat of the ensuing battle with her husband back at the chalet, one of the many frustrating cloth-drops over the parrot cage in this book. The marital rupture inflicted a string of indignities on Ivana as the New York tabloids engaged in dueling headlines, the most infamous being Maples’s \"Best Sex I Ever Had\" boast on the front page of The Post. With her faint air of Zsa Zsa Gabor and madcap aplomb, Ivana aerated Trump’s persona during their marriage — gave his brash, crass excess a dash of dynasty dazzle and camp. Once their partnership was sundered, Ivana took her blithe esprit and comic malaprops to enjoy the high life elsewhere (\"In 2006, my yacht was parked at Cannes for the film festival, and I was having a party with two hundred people on it\"), a pity since she might have been a more inspiriting first lady than the inscrutable, animatronic Melania. As someone who grew up in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia and witnessed Russian tanks crushing the Prague Spring, Ivana would have been more sensitive and perhaps even resistant to Russian interference than our current White House has been. Hurt and humiliated as she was by Donald’s infidelity, however, Ivana remains a loyalist, proclaiming, \"I believe he’ll be a great president,\" perhaps the first in a family dynasty. Of Ivanka, she suggests, \"Who knows? One day, she might be the first female — and Jewish — POTUS.\" I’vana throw up. The subtitle to Jerry Oppenheimer’s \"The Kardashians: An American Drama\" evokes the panoramic scope and muted trumpets of a Ken Burns epic, but crack open the book and the whiff of cheese is unmistakable. It’s almost comforting knowing that we are in the able, busy hands of a veteran journeyman with few pretensions to subtlety, scene-painting and the stately march of history. The author of biographies of the Clintons, Rock Hudson, Anna Wintour, Martha Stewart, Barbara Walters and other two-legged notables, Oppenheimer doesn’t doodle around — he hacks away. The prologue kicks off with a classic bit of ooga-booga involving a Christian prophetess who told the then-obscure lawyer Robert Kardashian that, in his words, \"one day my name, the Kardashian name, would be known around the world.\" And, lo, the curse came to pass. On June 17, 1994, the day that the white Ford Bronco chase covered live from coast to coast entered American lore, Robert Kardashian — friend, legal defender and personal exculpator of the former football great and \"Naked Gun\" co-star O.J. Simpson — read aloud his client’s rambling letter of professed innocence concerning the slashing homicides of his wife, Nicole, and her friend Ronald Goldman to a locust swarm of international press. He was identified on TV screens as \"Robert Kardashian, Simpson Friend,\" and from that moment the \"Kardashian\" name has become pop culture’s most persistent rash. Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Rob and their half sisters, Kendall and Kylie … all those freaking Kardashians, but the K who counts the most is, of course, Robert’s then-wife, Kris: Kristen Houghton Kardashian and the future Kris Jenner — schemer, dreamer, mother, impresario and \"cougar extraordinaire.\" It was she who would convert Kardashian from an instant household name into a self-perpetuating media brand and meme. It can’t be said that Oppenheimer is in Kris’s corner as she bops her way to the top. Even as a high schooler she’s tagged as a \"shallow opportunist,\" and the chapter where the teenage Kris meets her first lover, a 28-year-old professional golfer, is titled \"Hole in One.\" Her marriage to Robert in 1978 would have been a parodic misalliance under balmier circumstances. For most readers, Ira Levin’s 1972 best-selling novel \"The Stepford Wives\" was a satire and cautionary tale; for the future Mrs. Kardashian, the 1975 thriller movie it inspired was a training manual. While dating Kris, Robert insisted that she listen to instructional audiocassettes to stock the bare pantry of her mind with knowledge, mistakenly assuming she would be an obedient helpmate. Unfortunately for this, Kris’s favorite mini-series was \"The Thorn Birds,\" that passion-tossed ’80s show about forbidden love in the kangaroo outback. Despite these premarital misgivings, they wed and dutifully reproduced, but this Beverly Hills housewife was never going to relegate herself to hostess duty. Living large and spending big, Kris outfitted herself with fake boobs after seeing Nicole Simpson’s new pair (\"I thought, I want two of those, please!\"), and cheated on her husband with a young soccer player (\"You can be a good mother and still be a tramp,\" as one interested bystander puts it, words to live by). Divorce follows, and Robert Kardashian’s life becomes one sad, long, dribbling anticlimax. Basking in the celebrity glory of membership in O. J.’s dream team, after the shocking acquittal he found himself shunned, mocked and blackballed, and a couple of marriages later he died at age 59 from esophageal cancer. Meanwhile, Kris flourishes still, her subsequent union with the former Olympian Bruce Jenner (later Caitlyn) supplying a second-stage booster rocket to the Kardashian brand. Kim’s infamous sex tape with her then-boyfriend Ray J provided the initial liftoff. Modestly titled \"Kim Kardashian, Superstar,\" it surfaced in 2007, the same year that the reality series \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" debuted on E!, executive-produced by the inescapable Ryan Seacrest and with Kris presiding as the \"momager\" of this ever-expanding family enterprise. One sympathizes with Oppenheimer as he tries to keep track of all these loose marbles, but his chronicle of the Kardashian Kids carries unpleasant racial overtones to which he appears tone-deaf. He mentions Khloe’s marriage to \"the 6-foot-10 black pro basketball player Lamar Odom,\" cites Kim’s divorce from Damon Thomas, \"the first of her three African-American husbands,\" and later circles back to Khloe, who \"apparently had a real thing about romancing giant-size African-American hoop stars\" (my agog italics). Composing himself, Oppenheimer covers the controversy over the Kardashians’ appropriation of black culture and iconography, as epitomized by Kim’s bare-backsided cover shot for Paper magazine (the one that \"broke the internet\"), but by then it’s too late in the book to be affecting a furrowed brow and going all Charlie Rose on us. In the epilogue, Oppenheimer notes that all is not ducky in Kardashiana. The ratings for \"Keeping Up\" (now in its 14th season) are eroding and Kardashian mugs on the covers of slick magazines have become newsstand underperformers. During Fashion Week in 2016 Kim was robbed of $11 million-worth of jewelry by masked gunmen who broke into her Paris hotel suite and left her gagged — a crime that aroused suspicion that it was all a publicity stunt (it wasn’t, according to follow-up reports) and a hardy chorus of schadenfreude across social media. Oppenheimer floats the scenario that the wily Kris has one last shazam! act to pull: a daredevil leap for the biggest prize of all, the presidency. Citing Trump’s 2016 victory, he draws the obvious, dreary parallels between their reality-TV roots and social media reach, and explains that Kris and her family \"have a big following among young African-American men, a bloc that eluded Trump, and have huge support among millennial women 18 to 34, and support in the transgender community — especially if Caitlyn, a staunch Republican, plays ball and stumps for her ex-wife if she, indeed, runs for elective office as she’s suggested.\" Please, stop. First Ivanka’s name is floated, now Kris’s, as if the most powerful office in the shrinking free world is a glorious bauble awarded after long devotion to celebrity, self-enrichment and the family brand, public service be damned. Why keep feeding their ravenous egos? Shouldn’t their brazen success be enough for them? It’d be nice if the first woman president were someone who’d actually done some good.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/books/review/the-kardashians-jerry-oppenheimer-raising-trump-ivana-trump.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'New & Noteworthy', 'text': ' FAITH FOX By Jane Gardam.

I read it in one night shortly after Trump’s election. Trumpism is not Stalinism, but the relevance of Milosz’s insights — that intellectuals yearn to ‘belong to the masses’; that there is never a shortage of ways to justify cruelty in the name of the presumptively higher truth; that those who refuse to conform are caricatured as self-righteous purists — continues to haunt me as I watch so many I used to admire offer ever-more contorted defenses of Trumpism.

That many of the founders understood that collective moral evolution is possible, a proposition the originalists implicitly deny, is referred to in the review: \"All that the proponents — even the most radical among them — could hope for was that over time, attitudes toward racial differences would ‘evolve’ and that the powerful words ‘equal protection of the laws’ would eventually be interpreted to require public schools to be equal and not separate.\" It defies credulity that the founders, as avid students of theories of government that would improve upon the monarchical system, believed their own conception of the fundamental elements of the Constitution was the last word.

In this 1986 piece, originally printed in \"The Best American Essays,\" Hardwick meditates on the art and meaning of the essay in American life. Read an excerpt below: There is a self-congratulatory sense in the essay. It wants to signify that what has been offered is not a lesser offering, not just a review, a sketch, a \"piece\" — odd, useful word — summoned to feed the hungry space of periodicals. Sometimes the vagrant coinage \"essayistic\" appears in the press, and this is bad news for the language, since it indicates an extension of murky similarity to what is itself more than a little cloudy. To be like an essay means that, in a practical bit of prose, attention has been paid to expressiveness and that to gain expressiveness certain freedoms have been exercised, freedoms illicit in the minds of some readers, freedoms not so much exercised as seized over the border. The world of the American essay is a democratic one, a meritocracy. And much more so now than in the time of Emerson, a man from the old Harvard, well educated in a nation commonly much less so. The tones of \"Self-Reliance\" and even of \"Compensation\" would not appear to be suitable orchestration today. The contemporary essay is personal in its manners, as a display, and also as a wrestling with means, how to shape the exposition. Little is proposed as a model. A collection of essays is a collection of variations. The theme or the plot is not an imaginary construction, as in the novel, but arises from some factuality of history, culture, politics, personal experience and above all from general ideas. Yet the most interesting will have the self-propelled interior life of imaginative literature, and this is true even when they are responses to an occasion. Expertise, an acquisition promoted by usefulness, is less cogent to the essay than passion, less to the point than is the soloist’s personal signature flowing through the text. Such is the art of the essay.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/elizabeth-hardwick-art-meaning-american-essay.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Andy Weir: By the Book', 'text': '  The author of \"The Martian\" and, most recently, \"Artemis\" has never read Frank Herbert’s \"Dune\": \"Yes, I know. I’m the worst sci-fi fan in the universe.\" What books are on your nightstand? An advance proof of \"Rocket Men\" by Robert Kurson, about the Apollo 8 mission. Who is your favorite novelist of all time?  I grew up reading my father’s science-fiction collection, a huge collection of those pulpy mass-market paperbacks from the ’50s and ’60s. Making my way through the Holy Trinity of Asimov, Heinlein and Clarke was what made me fall in love with science fiction, and to some extent that experience has shaped my life ever since. So I’d have to pick one of them. Who are your favorite writers — fiction writers, nonfiction, journalists, poets — working today?  Oh, I wish you’d asked me this question a couple of years ago so I could answer Terry Pratchett. But sadly, he’s left us now. I really like Ernie Cline and, of course, George R. R. Martin. What genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? Not surprisingly, I love science-fiction. I also like mysteries and crime novels. Plus I like comedies in general, regardless of their genre. I generally avoid fantasy — with the exception of Pratchett, who was awesome. I avoid dystopia like the plague. I think that’s been thoroughly played out lately and I never really liked it in the first place. Though I do like full-on postapocalyptic stuff like \"The Stand.\" I tend to avoid fiction that’s too dark or serious or has a political message. For me, fiction is a form of escapism. I want to leave the real world, not sit around and stress about it. Just my personal preference. For the record, my stories are meant to be purely escapist. They have no subtext or message. If you think you see something like that, it’s in your head, not mine. I just want you to read and have fun. Tell us about your favorite science fiction books and short stories.  I think my favorite is \"I, Robot\" by Asimov. It was the first book I read that had multiple stories taking place in a consistent setting. It made the setting so rich and believable to me. Heinlein’s \"Tunnel in the Sky\" gave me a love of survival stories. As for recent fare, I absolutely love \"Ready Player One\" by Ernie Cline. I even wrote fanfiction for it that Ernie included in a later edition. That’s every fanfic author’s dream right there. What classic novel did you read recently for the first time? Okay, so here’s a confession: I didn’t read any of the \"Foundation\" books until last year. Somehow I skipped over them when I was a kid, and then I just never thought to go back to them. One day I did a reading and Q.& A. at a bookstore in the Bay Area and they gave me a vintage copy of \"Foundation\" as a thank-you gift. So I cracked it open and finally read one of the greatest science fiction tales of all time. What kinds of books do you reread and why? I rarely reread books, but a few years back, I was cleaning out my closet and found a box of old paperbacks from my youth. Among them were the \"Incarnations of Immortality\" series by Piers Anthony. I reread most of them. It was a completely different experience than when I read them as a teen, to say the least. What are your reading habits? Paper or electronic? Morning or night? One at time or simultaneous? I read paper, mostly. There’s nothing wrong with e-readers. I’m just used to paper is all. I will eventually move over to e-readers, I suspect. What’s the most interesting thing you learned recently from a book? During missions, astronauts are hooked up to biomonitoring systems so Houston can keep track of their health. As a rule, during a launch, their heart rates will spike to about 110 to 120 b.p.m. Not surprising, right? Well, the commander of Apollo 16 was an astronaut named John W. Young. During the launch, his heart rate never got above 70. Ice water in his veins, that guy. What book might people be surprised to find on your bookshelves? They’d probably be surprised by all the books on cocktails. High-end cocktail recipe books, history of cocktails, stuff like that. I’m an amateur mixologist. I even have a wet bar in my home. They’d probably be less surprised to see my D & D rulebooks. Take a moment to praise a few unheralded writers. Who should we be reading?  Well if you’re not reading Peter Clines’s books, you should be — though I don’t know if he would qualify as \"unheralded.\" And I really liked Robert Asprin. He seems to have been left behind since his passing. But his Myth Adventure series and Time Scout novels are fantastic. What kind of reader were you as a child? Your favorite book? Most beloved character? I was an avid reader as a kid, completely obsessed with science fiction. My favorite book back then was probably \"The Rolling Stones\" by Heinlein. It’s one of those great Heinlein juveniles, about a family on a grand space adventure from the Moon to Mars to Saturn’s rings. As for a character, I liked Kip Russell from \"Have Space Suit — Will Travel\" (yes, more Heinlein). I had some rough times when I was a kid, and the idea of just suddenly leaving Earth and going on adventures was awesome. You’re hosting a literary dinner party. Which three writers are invited? Do they have to be alive? If not: Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke. My aforementioned Holy Trinity. If it’s only living authors, I’ll take: George R. R. Martin, J .K. Rowling and Stephen King.  Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn’t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? Well, yes but I don’t want to say bad stuff about living authors. So I’ll confine my answer to authors who have passed on. Despite being a huge Heinlein fan, I’ve never understood the appeal of \"Stranger in a Strange Land.\" It was a huge publishing phenomenon in its time and sort of a milestone for the genre — I’ve seen it referred to as the first science fiction novel ever to appear on the New York Times best-seller list. And I can understand that the ideas in it blew people’s minds when it was published. But as a novel it’s just so far off the mark for me, I have a hard time seeing how it ever caught hold the way it did. On that subject of duds by my heroes: Clarke’s \"Rendezvous With Rama\" was a fantastic book. But I thought the sequels were plodding and dull. Who would you want to write your life story? Dave Barry. Let’s get some humor in there. What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet? (Looks left.) (Looks right.) (Looks left again.) I’ve never read \"Dune.\" Yes, I know. I’m the worst sci-fi fan in the universe. I’ve seen the film, the SyFy miniseries, and know pretty much every plot detail of the book from just hearing people talk about it. But I’ve never actually read it.  What do you plan to read next? Well, now that I’ve admitted I haven’t read \"Dune,\" I guess I should read \"Dune.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/books/review/andy-weir-by-the-book.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Novelist Revisits a Deadly Textile Union Strike From 1929', 'text': ' THE LAST BALLAD By Wiley Cash 378 pp. William Morrow/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99. In 1929, the National Textile Workers Union tried to gain a Southern stronghold, beginning with the Loray Mill in Gastonia, N.C. Many workers, pushed to near impossible production while fearing loss of pay or, worse, \"an arm or a hand or a finger or three,\" joined the union. The mill owners refused to negotiate and most of the 1,800 strikers reluctantly returned to work. When armed citizen deputies and police officers entered the tent village of the holdouts, shots were fired. Gastonia’s police chief was killed. The events of this summer of struggle are recovered in Wiley Cash’s vigorous third novel, \"The Last Ballad.\" The book begins with a newspaper ad, calling on every citizen to \"do his duty\" against the strike, which has been organized by \"Communists\" and \"Bolshevists\" who \"do not believe in our God, our Constitution or our government\" and are ready to \"kill, kill, kill.\" Ella May Wiggins is trying to keep four children alive on $9 a week. As Cash portrays her, \"with lint hung up in her throat and lungs like tar,\" Ella is a tough 28, a skilled spinner at American Mill No. 2, owned by the Goldberg brothers, who are considered \"white but not American\" and are tolerated by locals as long as their workers are treated as poorly as those at other mills. The employees at No. 2 may even make a little less, since it is the rare mill with an integrated work force. Housing remains segregated, though Ella heads the one white family living in Stumptown, the black residential neighborhood. Cash’s Ella is based on the union organizer and balladeer of the same name, though her story certainly wasn’t taught in any North Carolina schools this reviewer attended. She was a known folk hero to some: Alan Lomax published her ballads and Pete Seeger recorded them. Now Wiley Cash has given her a powerful book that speaks to contemporary concerns through historical injustice. Caught between caring for a sick child (one has already died of whooping cough) and missing mandatory 12-hour shifts, Ella decides to attend a rally, and causes a sensation when she sings one of her own songs, \"The Mill Mother’s Lament.\" She becomes an organizer, seeking to bring both white and black workers into the union, which doesn’t go over well with many people, including some labor leaders. After a Gastonia rally, Ella’s truck is run off the road, and things turn just as violent as you might expect. Though Ella is the central figure, the story is told from alternating perspectives, including that of a black train porter, a mill owner and a mill owner’s wife, who has a slightly far-fetched awakening of sympathy for working women. In the only contemporary and first-person passages, Ella’s now elderly daughter fills in her nephew, and the novel’s readers, on the tragic details of her mother’s life. It is in fashion to rely on factual evidence or autobiographical detail to bolster fiction, which is now considered even by some novelists to be \"artificial\" or \"embarrassing.\" Leaning on the \"real\" can yield a mesmerizing verisimilitude, but it can also limit imagination. In the retelling of the Loray Mill strike and the courageous role of Ella May Wiggins, Cash vividly blends the archival with the imaginative. As the historian Perry Anderson has noted, good historical fiction has the ability \"to waken us to history, in a time when any real sense of it has gone dead.\" When the willingness to suspend disbelief has taken on a new and sinister meaning, we not only need the novel of well-known history, we need the lost-to-history novel. Cash, with care and steadiness, has pulled from the wreckage of the past a lost moment of Southern progressivism. Perhaps fiction can help us bear the burden of Southern history, which is pressing down hard on us today.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/wiley-cash-last-ballad.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The Day Wall Street Collapsed', 'text': ' A FIRST-CLASS CATASTROPHE The Road to Black Monday, the Worst Day in Wall Street History By Diana B. Henriques 393 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $32. Diana B. Henriques is an award-winning financial journalist and a best-selling chronicler of the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme. Her new book focuses on a 30-years-ago crisis — the Black Monday debacle of 1987 when the stock market turned in a one-day loss that, on a percentage basis, was almost twice as large as the steepest drop in 1929. In making her case for the importance of the 1987 crash, Henriques has produced a valuable and unfailingly interesting account of a crucial two-decade period in Wall Street history — when markets made a full-bore transition from serving individual investors to a system dominated by giant corporations, mostly trading for themselves, and competing by means of arcane computer algorithms and spectacular processing speeds. A critical factor in her tale is the \"financial future.\" Futures are an old instrument used in trading commodities, like wheat. At spring planting, farmers and wholesale buyers could execute future contracts to lock in prices at harvest. Futures regulation, however, wasn’t fully formalized until the creation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (C.F.T.C.) in 1974. A portentous milestone was passed when the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or \"the Merc,\" started trading financial futures on a host of instruments — Treasury note interest rates, government-issued mortgage bonds, foreign currencies and various stock index futures, like Value Line and the S & P 500 stock indexes. After a jurisdictional catfight between the C.F.T.C. and the Securities Exchange Commission (S.E.C.), the regulators settled into an uneasy truce, although the Chicago institutions consistently outgunned the S.E.C. and the New York Stock Exchange in creativity and aggressiveness. It took only about a decade for futures and related instruments like options to dominate Wall Street trading. The intellectual motivation came from new axioms of \"efficient markets\" and \"rational agents\" that held that untrammeled markets were always self-correcting. Portfolio mathematics superseded fundamental business analysis. Computers and new cadres of \"quants\" reigned. In the 1970s, two young professors at Berkeley’s business school, Hayne E. Leland and Mark Rubinstein, conceived the idea of \"portfolio insurance,\" a technical method for protecting the value of a large institutional portfolio. They joined with John O’Brien, a highly sophisticated trader and a master salesman, to form a company, Leland O’Brien Rubinstein Associates (LOR), that soon was racking up stunning sales. LOR’s product was a set of algorithms that clicked in during a market downturn to limit losses. When the insurance algorithms were triggered, computers would sell futures to lock in a pricing floor, and then reverse the process as markets recovered. The concept was simple, but its execution requirements were formidable. Skeptical customers asked what would happen if the markets didn’t step up and buy futures at \"rational\" prices. That was easily waved off. Yes, in panicky markets, the futures clearing prices might be lower than the rational price, but canny traders would soon recognize the bargains on offer. That glibly danced by a scarier issue, however — the sheer scale of portfolios that were protected by insurance. A truly serious downturn could trigger huge robotic futures sales that could overwhelm the capacities of the traders. And that duly happened on Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987. After several weeks of slipping markets, floods of computer-driven futures orders hit the Chicago markets, overwhelming their systems and driving a steep plunge in futures prices, many all the way to zero, which signaled no bids at all. As futures prices collapsed, the implacable insurance algorithms accelerated the selling. Henriques gives us a gripping, almost minute-by-minute account of the weeks that followed, including the posturings, the denials and the panics, as well as the \"web of trust, pluck and improvisation\" that pulled the markets through. Summing up the crisis, Henriques places blame on \"disparate, blindly competitive and increasingly automated markets … gigantic and increasingly like-minded institutional investors\" and \"a regulatory community that was poorly equipped, ridiculously fragmented, technologically naïve and fatally focused on protecting turf.\" Henriques overstates her case, however, when she writes that \"more than a trillion dollars in wealth had been lost.\" And she cites a comment from President Reagan at an impromptu news conference during the worst days of the crisis that \"all the business indices are up. There is nothing wrong with the economy,\" which she compares to Herbert Hoover’s complacency in 1930. Actually, Reagan was right. The economy was fine. From 1986 through 1989, real (inflation-adjusted) growth was 3.5 percent, 3.5 percent, 4.2 percent and 3.7 percent. The 1980s stock market was a roller coaster. It opened with historically low price-earnings ratios, which allowed canny leveraged buyout investors to snap up solid companies at bargain prices. As copycat investors flooded into the buyout markets, the quality of deals deteriorated — laughably, one major acquisition was insolvent on the day the deal closed. The trillion-dollar drop in market values was just a recognition of reality. The saps who took the losses were counterbalanced by the lucky investors who got their money out in time. That said, Henriques has produced a highly intelligent and perceptive analysis of an important transitional era in modern finance. She is quite right that the quant-driven market complexities of the 1980s finally caused a real crash in 2007-8. Sadly, the deregulatory crusaders of the current administration seem to have paid no attention.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/diana-b-henriques-a-first-class-catastrophe.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Deadly Deeds, From Snowy Iceland to the 42nd Street Library', 'text': ' Who made you judge and jury? It might seem like a selfless public service to tie down a child molester and feed him to a ravenous pit bull — but what if you got the wrong guy? That’s the challenge Linwood Barclay throws down in PARTING SHOT (Doubleday Canada, $27), a tough-minded crime novel about the dangers of vigilantism. Cal Weaver, the low-key private eye last seen in Barclay’s \"Promise Falls\" trilogy, has been tasked with protecting 18-year-old Jeremy Pilford from the nameless and faceless internet mob that would like to see him dead. Jeremy’s sin was evading a charge of vehicular homicide on the grounds that he’d been \"so pampered, so excused from ever having to do things for himself, for ever having to accept responsibility for any of his actions,\" that he never developed a sense of right or wrong. That earned him both a nickname, \"the Big Baby,\" and the intense hatred of the public. \"The boy had been reduced online to a caricature,\" Weaver notes. \"A whining, pampered infant.\" As a protective move, Weaver bundles his charge off to Jeremy’s great-aunt’s summer home on Cape Cod, where the detective sees a side of this young man that makes him question his own assumptions. Barclay introduces some creative variations on his theme, including a theatrical stunt that involves capturing a suspected offender and tattooing a confession on his back. The most cynical is posting a candid photo of the Big Baby on an internet website that goes by the name of \"Just Deserts.\" There’s good money in that, according to one amateur paparazzo who has been stalking Jeremy. Real crimes, unspeakably nasty ones, including murder, figure in this well-built novel. But what stays with you is Jeremy, hounded by strangers competing to report sightings of him as if he were an insentient avatar in some violent video game. In DEADLY CURE (Pegasus, $25.95), Lawrence Goldstone presents a chilling account of the deadly respiratory diseases (and even deadlier medical treatments) that are claiming the lives of Brooklyn children during the hard winter of 1899. With effective cough medicine as yet undiscovered, parents are dosing their babies with dubious patent potions like \"Orangeine\" that kill some of them, sicken many more and cause others to become addicted. Dr. Noah Whitestone, the civilized sleuth in this medical mystery, understands the distinctions between two new wonder drugs, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and acetalized morphine (heroin), and promptly sounds the alarm. But greedy pharmaceutical companies race their offerings into production before the government can ensure their safety. The Pure Food and Drug Act won’t be passed until 1906, and not even New York’s governor, Theodore Roosevelt, has the clout to rein in the \"vast web of corruption in our pharmaceutical industry\" that has cost so many lives and introduced the world to some killer drugs. ♦ There’s always a solid sense of history in Arnaldur Indridason’s moody Icelandic mysteries. Although set in present-day Reykjavik and featuring a retired cop named Konrad, THE SHADOW DISTRICT (Thomas Dunne/Minotaur, $25.99), translated by Victoria Cribb, looks back on World War II, when Iceland was \"a poor farming community … torn up by its roots and dragged into the maelstrom of world events.\" Newly independent in 1944, the republic was politically neutral during the war, although occupied by Allied troops, mainly Americans, who were warmly welcomed by some of the local women. But when one of them was strangled behind the National Theater, suspicion fell on an American soldier. Konrad enters this story in modern times when he investigates the murder of a very old man who kept a horde of newspaper clippings about that wartime crime. With his usual delicate touch, Indridason weaves in just enough folklore about the huldufolk (elvish \"hidden people\" who create havoc when disturbed) to remind us that a nation can never live down its legends. ♦ How is a librarian like a bartender? This particular bartender, Brian McNulty, and this particular librarian, Raymond Ambler, are both the creations of Con Lehane, who clearly admires those who toil selflessly in the helping professions. McNulty makes no more than a cameo appearance (just enough to remind us that, like Hickey in \"The Iceman Cometh,\" he’s been sorely missed) in MURDER IN THE MANUSCRIPT ROOM (Thomas Dunne / Minotaur, $25.99). The second title in a nicely bookish series, this one highlights the formidable memory and ratiocinative skills of Ambler, the curator of crime fiction at the landmark New York Public Library building on 42nd Street, whose work on a planned exhibit called \"A Century-and-a-Half of Murder and Mystery in New York City\" (and doesn’t that sound positively delicious!) is interrupted by the discovery of a corpse stuffed among the shelves of murder mysteries. \"It’s a big building,\" the cop who’s been assigned to the case notes, \"lots of places to hide a body\" — an observation that no doubt gave Lehane the idea for this warm and cozy new series.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/books/review/new-crime-fiction-linwood-barclay.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '‘Murder on the Orient Express’ Reveals Its Mysteries Anew', 'text': ' MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS By Agatha Christie Read by Kenneth Branagh 6 hours, 12 minutes. HarperAudio. $29.99. Before I pressed play on the new audio version of \"Murder on the Orient Express,\" I visited a particular corner of my den, a shelf crammed with muzzy-edged paperbacks, some of them missing chunks of their covers. The list price on most of them is 50 cents, which doesn’t take into account the extra markdowns from the secondhand bookstores I haunted in high school. That was the peak of my Agatha Christie obsession. I collected a few dozen of her novels, and I read them cover to ragged cover, staying up as late as it took. Back then I lived for the day when I would actually spot the murderer before Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple explained who it was to me. (Never happened.) I’d reach the end and then scan back through pages for all the clues I’d missed, and I’d see how the puzzle was put together. Occasionally after enough time had passed, I’d reread one, pretending I didn’t remember the ending, and then I’d congratulate myself for figuring it out, feeling significantly smarter the second time around. I couldn’t do that with \"Murder on the Orient Express.\" I couldn’t even pretend not to remember the ending: It’s one of Christie’s most convoluted and shocking. So as I settled in to listen to Kenneth Branagh’s always mesmerizing voice tell me the story of the Orient Express and the potential murderers roaming its passageways, I wondered if over six hours might be a bit of a chore. After all, I knew who did it. There was no puzzle to solve. Instead, the book was a revelation: It turns out that my teenage self (unsurprisingly) had not really appreciated Christie. Because by focusing on the puzzle, I had missed the pure joy of her voice. The sly humor and clever asides. The cutting way she sums up a character in a few strokes. You can tell she liked Dickens. One traveler has \"a long, mild, amiable face rather like a sheep.\" An intimidating Russian princess commands the eyes because of her sheer unattractiveness: \"It was an ugliness of distinction — it fascinated rather than repelled.\" And when an English military man glances past Poirot without pausing, \"Poirot, reading the English mind correctly, knew that he had said to himself, ‘Only some damned foreigner.’\" The conjuring power of Branagh’s voice is the perfect complement to the wit and breadth of Christie’s. There is plenty of room here for him to play — he summons up an Italian, a German, a Swede, a couple of Hungarians, a Greek, a Frenchman, a Russian, and assorted Brits and Americans. (It’s this last one that made me laugh out loud more than once.) Branagh brings them to life in a few words, and it’s an impressive balancing act. The accents are all slightly exaggerated, but the humor has a soft touch; it’s never cartoonish. He manages to give each potential cliché a soul, and then he sends them off, one by one, ready to slip into their respective slots among the whirring mass of gears and levers that form the plot. Oh yes. The plot. It goes like this: While headed home to England for a much-needed rest after solving a case in Syria, master detective Hercule Poirot finds himself booked on an unusually full train during a slow time of year. As he settles in for the three-day trip across Europe, he finds that the passengers are a mixed bunch, including a mysterious young woman and the English colonel who admires her, the dragonish Russian princess, an American woman who talks ceaselessly at high volumes and one solitary older man who exudes \"a strange malevolence.\" Soon enough one of the passengers — I’m not saying who — is found murdered inside a locked sleeping compartment on the same night that the train has run into a massive snowbank in the middle of Yugoslavia. Everyone on board is trapped for an unknown amount of time. It seems impossible that the murderer could have left the train — there are no tracks in the snow. And in the murder victim’s room there are, if anything, far too many clues, several of which point in opposite directions. The killer is left-handed. The killer is right-handed. The killer is a man. The killer is a woman. All of Christie’s trademarks are here: red herrings on top of red herrings, astonishing leaps of logic by Poirot and enough low-hanging clues to leave you feeling as if you’re getting a handle on the thing…until you realize you have no idea at all. That sense of not being able to keep up is, I think, compounded by the format — if I were reading a print version, I’d like to flip back to remind myself of what the efficient British woman whispered to the colonel or what the diplomat said about his wife’s sleeping pills several chapters earlier. At times while listening, I itched with the need to check my memory. That’s not really an option. You’re at the mercy of Poirot’s recaps of the information, with no ability to shore up your own investigative efforts. Which doesn’t matter in the least. Just sit back and enjoy the whir of all the moving parts, and trust two spellcasters to bring it all together.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/murder-orient-express-agatha-christie-audiobook-kenneth-branagh.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Celebrity Couples Therapist Turns to Adultery', 'text': ' THE STATE OF AFFAIRS Rethinking Infidelity By Esther Perel  Read by the author11 hours, 57 minutes. HarperAudio. $24.99. I’m kind of in love with Esther Perel. We spent nearly 12 hours together lately, Perel’s cat-nippy French-accent whispering in my ear. She’s got this whole older woman, sexy-wise, passionate intellectual thing that makes you feel she knows the depths of your shame and the vibrancy of your lust. Her voice is tinged with a sadness you imagine she’d like to soothe by reading Anaïs Nin aloud to you in bed. She also staunchly calls out your self-deceptions, which, in a sex expert, is just what you need. Many people met Perel 10 years ago when she published \"Mating in Captivity,\" a smart, incisive international hit that dealt with how to stay married, or really how to keep having decent married sex. (Perel’s answer: Try maintaining at least a tiny bit of mystery.) That book secured Perel’s place as one of America’s hottest couples therapists. Over the past decade she’s held dozens of workshops and training seminars and launched a podcast that broadcasts what happens in her therapy room. Now she’s back with us, the listening public, with \"The State of Affairs.\" Here Perel, once again, takes on the subject of monogamy and sex, though not from the tautologically dull perspective of faithful spouses bored with each other but from the far more tantalizing angle of husbands and wives who stray. Woo-hoo! Right? With the possible exception of death, extramarital affairs are humanity’s greatest source of intrigue and drama. \"The State of Affairs\" is thorough, even exhaustive. The book itself has 14 index entries under adultery (e.g., \"adultery, children resulting from\") and 28 under affairs (\"affairs, with exes,\" \"affairs, erotic charge following\"). One imagines enraged cuckolded spouses in their cars, fast forwarding to find if there’s a section on \"marriage, to a total ass.\" Perel divides \"The State of Affairs\" into four parts: What are we talking about when we talk about infidelity, what happens after you cheat, why did you cheat in the first place, and what now? Along the way she makes many excellent points. Even happy people cheat. An affair is not necessarily evidence of a problem in the relationship. The urge may arise from an individual’s desire for self-discovery or need to feel more alive. The word jealousy fell out of favor in the ‘70s. Perel notes that we’ve replaced it with terms that give the moral high ground to the betrayed: trauma, intrusive thought, attachment injury. Spouses in traditional (and untested) marriages often fail to discuss what they mean by monogamy. Is flirting a transgression? What about Skype porn? A kiss? Perel is Belgian, the daughter of parents who both lost their entire families in the Holocaust. She believes we can survive more pain than we think. \"Whenever I tell someone I’m writing a book about infidelity, the immediate reaction is usually ‘Are you for or against?’\" she says. \"My answer is, ‘Yes.’\" Listeners may remember this and many of the book’s best lines from Perel’s TED talk and…pardon the interruption, but can we talk about the TED talk to book superhighway for a minute? TED talks are about 2,500 words. Publishers snap them up and insist their authors bloat the contents to 80,000 words, at which point the original becomes flabby, misshapen and lame. The filler stuffed into \"The State of Affairs\" takes two forms. The first is endless first-name-only anecdotes meant to illustrate Perel’s points. In real life, I’m sure, the stories were all-consuming. But through your headphones they are excruciating. \"Alex and Erin understood the need to negotiate boundaries and lay down agreements to deter these all-too-human emotions,\" Perel says in her chapter on revenge. Are you kidding me? \"During her two-year affair with the owner of the local bike shop, Megan got tired of hiding from everyone around her.\" Snore. The tedium is broken (not in a good way) with Perel saying words like Tinder and Grindr, which I suspect she does to sound with-it but have the opposite effect. The only blessing is that, after hours of listening to Perel’s anecdotes, your mind gets soupy and Perel herself, while reading, begins to sound so jaded and cold that you start to wonder if she’s slightly perverted, which, at least momentarily, makes the listening more interesting. Perel also fills up \"The State of Affairs\" with quotes. Proust! Leonard Cohen! Goethe! Anne Sexton! Shakespeare! Cheryl Strayed! These people, too, are magnificent when encountered in full, and before Perel makes it clear she’s reading a quote, you think she’s suddenly upped her writing game. But over all, the regular interjection of others’ words sounds simply dutiful and uninspired. Plus the first-person quotes are a real tease. They make you realize how desperate you are for Perel to share more of herself. Still, \"The State of Affairs\" provides some new tools for handling the toxic trash heap of emotion infidelity leaves in its wake. This is the focus of the book’s last section, where Perel really shines. What now? To Perel, this is the real question. Marriage creates a \"core existential paradox.\" Not all needs can be met and we all know it. \"Security and adventure, togetherness and autonomy, stability and novelty.\" You can’t have it all with one person. Is there not a better way? Perel thinks so. Toward the very end she argues that she, too, has grown weary hearing all these tales of infidelity and in the not-so-distant future, she believes, the idea that marriage must be sexually exclusive will be seen as retrograde. \"It will never work! you may be thinking,\" she says, anticipating the American rebuttal to what she calls \"ethical nonmonogamy.\" \"Marriage is complicated enough. It will destroy the family! It will be bad for the kids!\" She spits out this last sentence with obvious contempt. \"But people used to make the same predictions in the 1980s with couples pioneering religious, racial and cultural intermarriages.\" Perel divides couples working through infidelity into three categories: the Sufferers, the Builders and the Explorers. You can hear in her voice that she likes the Explorers best. They do not \"reject our unruly yearnings,\" \"double down on comfort and safety,\" and \"deafen the rumblings of eros,\" all of which Perel seems to find prudish. Instead, in the wake of an affair, \"these couples home in on each other with a level of intensity they haven’t experienced in years.\" Infidelity hurts, yes, but so does life. The explorers are \"deeply engaged — in pain, but alive.\" This is the Perel we love — the Perel who believes in the resilience of the human heart, the Perel who sees our darkest selves and accepts us anyway. \"When a couple comes to me in the aftermath of an affair,\" she writes, \"I often tell them this: Your first marriage is over. Would you like to create a second one together?\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/state-of-affairs-esther-perel-audiobook.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Nate Dern Narrates His Schizophrenic but Substantive Collection of Writings', 'text': ' NOT QUITE A GENIUS By Nate Dern Read by the author 7 hours, 43 minutes. Simon & Schuster Audio. At the start of his self-narrated audiobook, \"Not Quite a Genius,\" Nate Dern admits the obvious: \"I like attention,\" he says, \"I like it too much, so I do dumb things to get it.\" Such is his excuse for having joined the cast of a reality TV show called \"Beauty and the Geek\" when he was a student at Harvard. In an age of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo accounts of sexual harassment and assault — at a time when we are just a tweet away from nuclear war with North Korea — I was honestly unsure whether I could care what Dern, a senior writer for Funny or Die, had to say about the world. But that skepticism soon made way for a much deeper appreciation for a voice I now consider to be talented, hilarious and, to my surprise, meaningful. There is a lot going on in \"Not Quite a Genius\" — sometimes too much. Dern takes on many perspectives (from his own to those of an archeologist exploring a suburban man-cave and a scientist-turned-governor); formats (the collection encompasses both fiction and nonfiction); and themes (i.e., capitalism, gender nonconformity, death) — all delivered, thanks to his skillful audio performance, in a plethora of voices. But Dern is often at his most convincing when he is not being Dern per se. As a category, the first-person nonfiction essays did the least for me, which meant the book got off to a slow start. However, he had me by the second chapter: \"Before We Begin Our Yoga Practice, a Few Words About Our Other Offerings and That Hissing Sound.\" First off, points for the title. Second, this essay is the first of many that demonstrate Dern’s gift for satire, a gift I became intimately familiar with and snobbily judgmental of during my five years working for The Onion. Dern effectively mimics the voice, style and tone of a yoga instructor to gradually reveal the demonic cult that this studio actually serves. It’s a slow and sneaky revelation that I, much like the studio’s imaginary clients, did not see coming. Also, it’s worth listening to the audio edition of the book just to hear Dern perform the word \"Ujjayi.\" Throughout the book, Dern proves himself a pro at creatively commenting on seemingly banal, annoying or trendy aspects of contemporary life in a way that actually feels and, more important, sounds interesting. Man buns, handwashing signs, the cold-pressed juice industry: Each of these is obviously deserving of ridicule and public mockery, but Dern’s approach was refreshingly original. When I heard the chapter heading \"Walt Whitman, Spin Class Instructor,\" I laughed out loud while walking down the street. \"Whatever satisfies the soul is truth. Pedal to the beat,\" the American poet/fitness instructor preaches. \"Keep your face always toward the sunshine — and shadows will fall behind you. Also, keep your heels down — and your core will be engaged,\" he continues, offering an optimistic, nonreligious path through his verse. There are many ways and reasons to clown spin classes. Invoking Walt Whitman to do so is one of the most inspired devices I’ve yet encountered. He applies the same incisiveness and absurdity to other topics like fire safety signs, meteorology headlines, and parents who won’t vaccinate their children. In fact, Dern invokes so many forms and tackles so many subjects, I occasionally felt disoriented. But beneath the frenzied surface waters of this collection, I found deeper currents. I have a soft spot and a high bar for comedic commentary on technology. I have to hand it to Dern for using digital terminology to explore the beyond-digital substance of how rapidly our world is changing. The chapter \"Flowers for Ai_One\" actually made me hit the pause button at certain points. It was difficult to hear in audio because the language is written in a pseudocomputer syntax, but the core of the story comes through nonetheless. Dern rewrites Daniel Keyes’s classic short story-turned-novel \"Flowers for Algernon\" as the reporting logs of an artificial intelligence device. The protagonist’s journey brought me as much excitement and sadness as the original story did. A third of the way through the book, I felt fully confident I was in the trained hands of a professional comedian who had taken the \"yes and\" so deeply ingrained in improv comedy and constructed multiple layers of funny to expose multiple layers of truth about the world around us. Nate Dern is funny. Officially. He works for a company with the word \"funny\" in its name. But the most moving parts of the book are those filled with — I have no better way to say this — heart. I found myself most affected by the pieces that didn’t even try to be humorous, or did so only fleetingly and rarely with any early indication of the tough subject matter they’d be addressing. In \"How Many Farts Measure a Life?\" I thought I was going to get a short story about how the modern notion of friendship has been altered by the distractions of screen-based app notifications and social media addiction. Instead, the story goes far beyond selfie culture to questions of mortality, the afterlife and self-worth. To Dern’s immense credit, he approaches these ideas sideways to expose how it’s often the tiny, almost insignificant moments in life that lead us to question the existence of God, our own value to the world and our commitment to keep living another day. The greatest gift of Dern’s book is this inconvenient, no-warnings reminder of the awkward and painful and uncomfortable. To be honest, I expected the first-person college anecdotes and the Wi-Fi terms-and-conditions parody. What I did not expect, and therefore most appreciate, were chapters like \"Negative Visualization,\" which probably does the most to combine Dern’s concerns with society, technology and death, in the form of a court transcript for a case that asks how seriously we should take commentary posted in online forums. So no, Nate Dern may not be quite a genius. Still, he has written a book that is very smart, funny and thoughtful, and that might be just what the world needs.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/nate-dern-not-quite-a-genius-audiobook.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Wresting Golda Meir From the Shadows', 'text': ' LIONESS Golda Meir and the Nation of Israel By Francine Klagsbrun Illustrated. 824 pp. Schocken. $40. In late September 1973, Israel’s Labor Party made its final campaign pitch for the upcoming elections. It placed ads in all the newspapers with a picture of its leader, the admired and beloved prime minister, Golda Meir, surrounded by reassuring words: \"Quiet reigns on the banks of the Suez. The lines are secure; the bridges are open; Jerusalem is united.\" Days later, on Yom Kippur, Syria and Egypt launched a massive pincer attack from north and south, their advancing tanks crushing the illusions of a complacent nation and forever shifting public opinion away from Meir. Despite hard-fought victories in both the war and the postponed vote, she resigned four months after re-election, condemned as a woman out of her depth (emphasis on \"woman\"). She died in 1978. And while American Jews remember her with pride and fondness (she spent her girlhood in Milwaukee and spoke a disarming Midwestern English of pinched nasal vowels), Meir has remained an object of some scorn in Israel. Her miscalculation contributed to the deaths of thousands. Her dismissal of the Palestinian nation (\"no such thing as Palestinians,\" she notoriously said) has won her few admirers on the left. But perspectives have begun to shift with the passage of time. As 2018 approaches — the 120th anniversary of Meir’s birth — we are in the midst of a re-evaluation of her legacy that places the 1973 disaster into a broader context of a life of rich accomplishment. In that emerging view, her failure to anticipate the attack must be understood as a reflection of the thinking of her security establishment; her leadership during the war was forceful. Last year, the Israeli state archives published a 700-page volume of her notes and documents with scholarly comment that reflects such revisionism. A grandson of Meir’s has recently started a foundation in her name to spread the word and to mark the anniversary. Events are planned both in Israel and the United States. To this growing Golda rethink, Francine Klagsbrun has contributed a thorough and absorbing examination of the woman and her role in Zionism and Israel. \"Lioness\" wrests Meir from the shadow of the Yom Kippur War and presents her life and career as a lens to examine Israel’s challenges — borders, settlements, occupation, terror and the social and ethnic divide between Jews of European and those of Middle Eastern origin. The author of more than a dozen books, many on Jewish subjects, and an essayist for The Jewish Week, Klagsbrun has spent years reviewing thousands of pages of documents, interviewing those closest to Meir (most now dead) and, while writing with affection, applying the tools of a contemporary truth tester (no, Meir never witnessed a pogrom as a small child in Kiev despite often invoking memories of one; and no, despite a Broadway play and a book by Seymour Hersh, Meir didn’t threaten to unleash nuclear weapons in the 1973 war if Nixon didn’t airlift needed supplies). In many ways, as Klagsbrun’s narrative makes clear, Meir was the archetypal Zionist. An Eastern European Jew who, after a lengthy American detour, immigrated to Palestine in 1921, Meir embodied the movement’s socialist and egalitarian modesty as well as its tough-minded militarism. She was what the Israelis call a bitzuist — a doer. She not only raised millions of dollars for Zionism and Israel but also fought to save European Jews from the Nazis, carried out clandestine visits to Jordan’s King Abdullah and, as labor minister, built tens of thousands of homes for new immigrants. Born Golda Mabovitch in the humblest of origins (her father’s inability to earn an income kept the family in penury for years), Meir quickly stood out once she landed in America with her family, embraced the Zionist movement and rose through relentless focus and networking. But, of course, Meir was highly atypical for a simple reason: She was a woman. When she was named foreign minister in the 1950s, she was the only woman in the world to hold that job. When she became prime minister in 1969, she was one of three women in such a post but the other two — Indira Gandhi of India and Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Ceylon — came to their roles following the death of a father and a husband. Everything about how Meir dealt with her gender is fascinating, telling and often somewhat tragic. She suffered from it but was not above exploiting it (\"Call me Golda,\" she disarmingly told everyone). Just as Barack Obama studiously avoided being seen as a black president, Meir stayed far away from both femininity and feminism. She wore no makeup, smoked like a chimney and, although she began her political rise through the Zionist women’s associations in the late 1920s, she claimed later never to have belonged to a women’s organization. Nixon said of Indira Gandhi that she acted \"with the ruthlessness of a man but wanted always to be treated like a woman,\" whereas Meir \"acted like a man and wanted to be treated like a man.\" Ben-Gurion referred to Golda as \"the only man in the cabinet.\" There is every reason to see all the manliness pretense as a survival mechanism, pure and simple. There was no model for an ambitious female politician and Meir was not about to devote time to inventing one. Meir married her American boyfriend Morris Meyerson, a dreamy lover of music and poetry who (like her father) never earned much of a living, never really wanted to move to Palestine and pretty much never saw his wife. The marriage collapsed as Golda took lovers from among her political colleagues (and she later took the Israeli name \"Meir\"). Their son and daughter were badly neglected as she spent months at a time abroad on fund-raising and diplomatic missions and, when home, stayed at meetings late into the night. Despite suffering personally from societal indifference toward working mothers, Meir never made the issue her own. She was vicious to Shulamit Aloni, an Israeli feminist and civil rights lawyer, a rising power within Labor whom she forced out. In the 1970s, when feminists began to exert influence globally, she dismissed them as \"crazy women who burn their bras and … hate men.\" Klagsbrun presents all this as part of the broad sweep of Meir’s life but the topic is ripe for deeper exploration. As part of the renaissance in Meir scholarship, others are taking a closer look at her specifically as a woman leader. (Pnina Lahav, a law professor at Boston University, is deep into a book that analyzes Meir as a victim of sexist mores, a trailblazer and a role model.) Golda Meir was prime minister of Israel when the Palestinian movement became enamored of terrorism, hijacking planes and kidnapping Israeli Olympic athletes. She had no patience for talk of a Palestinian state other than Jordan. \"There will be no third state in the area,\" she said. While that put her at odds with most thinking in the recent past, she would feel at home with the political debate in Israel today, where talk of a Palestinian state is fading fast. That may not bring the world any closer to peace in the Holy Land. But it will probably aid in Meir’s rehabilitation.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/francine-klagsbrun-lioness-golda-meir-israel-biography.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Father-Son Bonding, With Homer as Guide', 'text': ' AN ODYSSEY A Father, a Son, and an EpicBy Daniel Mendelsohn 306 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. \"Few sons are the equals of their fathers,\" Athena says in the \"Odyssey.\" \"Most fall short, all too few surpass them.\" Odysseus, the great storyteller, traveler, survivor, husband, lover, warrior and revenge-hero, is one; Daniel Mendelsohn, the distinguished critic and classicist, may well be another. But that is the question this subtle and profoundly moving book poses. Can a man surpass his father? Can he even know enough of his father to know if he has surpassed him? And is that Oedipal urge, the desire to take the father down, to be as good or better than he was, really the right one? Do not love and honor have in the end something more to say? Just like the \"Odyssey,\" which it consciously mimics, \"An Odyssey\" is an intricately constructed journey, conglomerating the stories of a son and his father and their travails through life and love. Like Homer, Mendelsohn weaves his basket with many wands: first, the story of the \"Odyssey\" itself, which patiently, book by book, he explicates with exemplary and generous clarity. Folded into that is the story of his own life, his distance from his father, his coming out as gay when a teenager, his falling in love with the ancient Greek texts as a place of precision and austerity in books whose pages were \"as cool to the touch as sliced apples.\" These many stories of a man’s life, a family and a father-son relationship are themselves set within a frame of the undergraduate \"Odyssey\" seminar Mendelsohn teaches at Bard College, which, amazingly, Daniel’s 81-year-old father, Jay Mendelsohn, decides to attend, as well as a 10-day \"Retracing the ‘Odyssey’\" cruise that Daniel and Jay take together when the seminar is over. Described like that, the book might sound dense and impossible, overladen with structural elements, but Mendelsohn’s skill as a verbal architect and manager of scenes — he began his academic career as a brilliant critic of Euripides — means that this complexity is a route to revelation. Nothing is plodding here. He rearranges time, as the \"Odyssey\" does, working and reworking different moments from the poem itself, the seminar and the cruise into one intricately woven fabric — the image that Homer himself repeatedly uses of poetry and the poetic. The complexity seems natural, an account of the quality of life itself, transcribed as it needs to be, not formalized or homogenized, but ripplingly various and multidimensional, as Homer, Odysseus and their stories all are. It is, in many ways, the poignant account of a search for a father, looking beyond the curt, undemonstrative and frightening figure of childhood and reaching after the reality of the person. The poignancy comes from a repeated mismatch. Mendelsohn’s subtle, investigative mind, so often able to see clearly and empathetically into the texts of a remote and long-gone civilization, and to lead his students to that shared understanding, finds himself reaching in the dark, drawing \"a blank,\" when looking for the man who may be closer to him than any other. Jay Mendelsohn is a retired research scientist, a reductionist, a simplifier, a solution-finder, for whom \"x is x,\" not a weaver of tales but a doubter of them, with \"a reverence for struggle\" and a love of baseball because of its \"geometries.\" He had been involved in the designing of early target recognition systems, a technological task he described to his son as \"teaching computers to see,\" and believes that there is \"a deep and inscrutable essence to things\" if only one took the trouble to find it. He is appalled by the flux of life, can’t stand traffic and has to predict every part of a journey before he sets out on it, even identifying the final parking spot before he leaves. It seems to his son that for Jay, as Poseidon was for Odysseus, \"some implacable traffic god\" was always against him. And so the book arranges itself around the polarities of fixity and flux, certainty and doubt, rigidity and tenderness. Like Odysseus, Mendelsohn sees in existence a pattern of eddies and back-turnings, an endlessly shifting density field in which identity and truth come and go. Homer describes Odysseus as poikilometis, meaning dapple-skilled, spotty-skilled, essentially various. That beautifully flickering self is at the heart of Homer’s meaning in the \"Odyssey,\" which, as Mendelsohn says, effectively buries the \"Iliad,\" moving beyond the beefcake vision of the heroes at Troy to something much more subtle and adaptable — and modern. Odysseus’ unreliability is his virtue. Mendelsohn père cannot see that. For him Odysseus is not a real hero because he lies and cheats on his wife, tells false, self-inflating stories, is always relying on the gods to get him out of trouble, is not really all-man in the way of more singular, self-sufficient heroes, but is always shifting into difference, like the shimmering polychrome cloths with which the Homeric world was entranced. Mendelsohn is too attentive a writer to remain content with that straight-up characterization, and, as the book evolves, his father’s rigidity starts to fracture and dissolve. Jay seemed so hard but \"every now and then he would say things or let slip a remark that was so unexpectedly tender or generous or poetic that you’d be confounded — would find yourself in a state of what the Greeks called aporia, ‘helplessness’ … ‘without a path.’\" Jay begins to treat his son not as a son but as another man, with the mysterious quality on those first, changed interactions, not of manliness or man-to-manliness, but of humility and gentleness. He allows himself to talk in front of the seminar about his life-shaping love for Daniel’s mother. Daniel learns that when his father was young a beautiful boy had fallen in love with him and that Jay had in that experience come to understand something of his son’s own homosexuality. It emerges that Jay’s childhood was deeply isolated and that his early life had been dogged by defeat and repeated failures of nerve, so that time and again he had not dared to embrace the life he might have had. His awkward, prickly, undemonstrative self became the price of a protected vulnerability. It was not Odysseus who was unheroic but Jay Mendelsohn; and his son comes to love him for that fragility. \"The best way to tell a certain kind of story,\" Mendelsohn says of Homer but knowing that it applies also to what he has written, \"is to move not straight ahead but in wide and history-laden circles.\" Turning back and looking again, confessing ignorance and accommodating failure is truer to human experience than any mathematician’s diving for the answer. A consciousness of mortality, the great and final failure, plays its part. \"Good teaching is like good parenting,\" he says of himself and of the man his father was slowly allowing himself to become; both \"arise from an acceptance of the inevitability of death.\" And it is with Jay’s death, about a year after the seminar and the cruise, that the book ends, as it must. Homer calls Odysseus the man of \"twists and turns,\" but he is also the man who knows \"the minds of many men.\" The two qualities are one: Indirection is the route to understanding and the shimmering, beautiful, dapple-skilled intelligence of this book, fueled by the belief that what you feel is intimate with what you know, is all the evidence of that you will ever need.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/daniel-mendelsohn-an-odyssey-memoir.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The First Modern President', 'text': ' PRESIDENT McKINLEY Architect of the American Century By Robert W. Merry Illustrated. 608 pp. Simon & Schuster. $35. At the turn of the 20th century, America emerged as a global power. The United States annexed Hawaii and the Philippines, liberated Cuba from Spanish rule, laid the way for the Panama Canal and began to pursue its own form of quasi-benevolent imperialism. In the public imagination, the figure most prominently associated with this burst of national energy is Theodore Roosevelt. \"T.R.\" charged up San Juan Hill (actually, Kettle Hill) at the head of his Rough Riders, dispatched a naval fleet around the world when he was president and wound up as a face on Mount Rushmore. William McKinley, the president who actually was responsible for America’s new role in the world, is largely overlooked or forgotten. In his measured, insightful biography, \"President McKinley: Architect of the American Century,\" Robert W. Merry seeks to set the record straight. He notes that the willful, flamboyant Roosevelt upstaged the staid, placid McKinley. Even Roosevelt’s children joked that he wanted to be \"the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral,\" and Roosevelt was not above personal derision. When McKinley seemed to hesitate before declaring war on Spain in 1898, Roosevelt is said to have suggested, in a private remark that inevitably became public, that the president’s backbone was \"as soft as a chocolate éclair.\" (The quip has also been attributed to House Speaker Thomas Reed.) In reality, Merry argues, McKinley was shrewd and patient, wily beneath the bland exterior. Elected president in 1896, McKinley was beginning his second term when he was assassinated by a deranged anarchist in September 1901. He was succeeded in the White House by Roosevelt, who had leveraged his war hero status to become governor of New York, before scrambling on the national ticket as McKinley’s running mate in 1900. On McKinley’s watch, the Spanish-American War had already been won and American sway broadened around the world through martial aggression and skillful diplomacy, including the Special Relationship with Britain and the Open Door policy toward China. At the time and still today, McKinley was regarded as a stolid, amiable figure, but plodding or nearly inert, more or less carried along by forces he could not or would not control. It is true that the idea of making the United States a global maritime power, a potential rival to Britain and its Royal Navy, was first pushed by Roosevelt and his friend Henry Cabot Lodge, a senator from Massachusetts, who coined the term \"the large policy.\" Roosevelt wanted to make America a great conquering nation. In a particularly bellicose speech to the Naval War College in 1897, he used the word \"war\" 62 times. McKinley disliked such swagger. Unlike Roosevelt, he had experienced combat as a young man. Serving as a quartermaster in the Civil War, McKinley had bravely, if unglamorously, driven a food wagon through heavy fire to deliver supplies to the troops at Antietam. Though he liked to be called \"the Major,\" he did not boast of his wartime exploits, and at a reunion of old soldiers he once wisely observed, \"My comrades, the memories of the war are sweeter than service in the war.\" At the beginning of his administration, McKinley had been wary about making Roosevelt assistant secretary of the Navy, the job T.R. coveted as a platform to push for American sea power. \"I want peace,\" McKinley told a mutual acquaintance, \"and I am told that your friend Theodore … is always getting into rows with everybody.\" When Roosevelt, grudgingly elevated to the post by McKinley, and Senator Lodge began agitating for American intervention in Cuba’s ongoing revolt against Spain, McKinley remarked, \"I have been through one war. I have seen the dead piled up; and I do not want to see another.\" Nonetheless, McKinley saw that \"isolation is no longer possible or desirable\" for a rising industrial giant in a global economy. America needed new markets and protected trade routes. President McKinley told a friendly congressman, \"I suspect that Roosevelt is right, and the only difference between him and me is that mine is the greater responsibility.\" Merry persuasively contends that McKinley, working quietly and deliberately, through indirection rather than bombast, guided America not only to liberate Cuba from Spain but also to seize the Philippines and press American interests all the way to China. On a scrap of paper, McKinley wrote, \"While we are conducting war and until its conclusion, we must keep all we get; when the war is over we must keep what we want.\" McKinley was not a tub-thumper for national grandeur. He spoke more idealistically about the need to \"uplift and civilize\" the Filipino people. Not unreasonably, he was attacked at the time by anti-imperialists like Mark Twain for hypocritically grabbing foreign lands while trying to sound like a good Christian. But as Merry notes, it was McKinley who first struck a balance between projecting power and serving humanitarian ends — between realism and idealism — that would become the guideposts of 20th-century American foreign policy. Elected congressman, governor of Ohio and two-term president, McKinley was a highly skilled politician. A sweet-tempered man who forswore carrying grudges, he was loving and endlessly solicitous of his invalided and complaining wife, Ida. Voters seemed to sense that he was kind and thoughtful. But his magnanimity was studied, and he could be ruthlessly manipulative when he needed to be. With his deep-set eyes and fastidious manners, McKinley had a \"demeanor of heavy quiet,\" Merry writes in a typically descriptive phrase. The president \"had a way of handling men so that they thought his ideas were their own,\" said Elihu Root, his secretary of war. \"He cared nothing about the credit, but McKinley always had his way.\" McKinley ended a period of congressional dominance and centralized federal power in the White House, and he transformed presidential politics by methodically building a national base by identifying voters for the Republican Party rather than simply relying on inspirational speeches. Merry is not alone in seeing McKinley as the first \"modern\" president, nor does he claim to be. He forthrightly credits Margaret Leech, whose \"In the Days of McKinley\" was published in the late 1950s, as well as more modern scholars like Lewis L. Gould and H. Wayne Morgan. He might have also pointed to Karl Rove, the Republican political organizer whose book on the 1896 election, \"The Triumph of William McKinley,\" identified McKinley as a genius at coalition building. Merry, a casual acquaintance of mine from his days as a Wall Street Journal reporter, is a veteran observer of Washington politics. McKinley is the second president he has rehabilitated; in 2010, Merry published a respectful volume on James K. Polk. He brings an old-school dispassion to his work. While hardly unopinionated — Merry’s \"Sands of Empire\" (2005) is a sharp attack on the hubris of American interventionism — he has a healthy respect for the facts, wherever they lead. Like his current subject, Merry is methodical and deliberate, perhaps overly so, and readers of \"President McKinley\" may learn more than they wish about Ohio politics in the 1880s. Clear and thoroughgoing, Merry’s book is a deft character study of a president. It is also a brief for the slow-and-steady school of leadership, a subtle reminder that showboating moralizers can be balanced by grounded and wiser souls.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/robert-w-merry-president-william-mckinley-biography.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Elizabeth Hardwick Showed What Essays Could Do', 'text': ' THE COLLECTED ESSAYS OF ELIZABETH HARDWICK Edited by Darryl Pinckney 610 pp. New York Review Books. Paper, $19.95. Elizabeth Hardwick, who was born in 1916 and died in 2007 and published eight books in between, was a writer perturbed by biography. Those three statements, in fact — the birth, the death, and the books — would likely have struck her as sufficient biographical information. When it came to the ways in which writers were canonized, she was passionately exasperated by a myopic chronicling of a life, rather than an interrogation of the work. What mattered was how an individual life illuminated literature and vice versa, not the flotsam and facticity of someone’s days. The most prominent facts of her own life — her marriage to the poet Robert Lowell, her involvement with Partisan Review and then The New York Review of Books — are themselves fully enmeshed in literature: the arguing about it, writing about it, building love affairs around it. She was visibly and professionally a writer, but her higher vocation was \"reader.\" As Darryl Pinckney, a former \"fascinated and silent\" student of hers, notes in his introduction to her \"New York Stories,\" \"she wrote to honor the fiction she cared about, which was why in fiction she was so easily discouraged.\"  The fiction, particularly her third novel, \"Sleepless Nights,\" has a quality of supreme distillation, as do her short stories. This has nothing to do with them being short — their length is the only thing that could be said to be average about them. Instead, this quality of compression owes itself to a kind of humility — an odd word, perhaps, to use for a writer of grand ideals and ambitions, but the humility and the high ideals work together: She holds herself, unrelentingly, to the task of saying something important. As she puts it in her essay \"Grub Street,\" \"Making a living is nothing, the great difficulty is making a point, making a difference — with words.\" Her distaste for the Gradgrindian plod of biography, then, is the counterpart to her love of literature. Literature does what life can’t and what boring biographers won’t: omit all the tedious bits that clot our days and signify nothing. In good fiction, every sentence and detail is necessary. The same is true of these impeccably economical essays, which, collected here with a wise introduction by Pinckney, offer a rich immersion in both her brilliant mind and the minds of so many others. \"The Decline of Book Reviewing\" is an essay that’s often called \"seminal,\" which is not the same as \"good,\" at least by Hardwick’s own standards. Reading her in righteous and lambasting mode is certainly fun and invigorating, but this is also a fish-shooting sort of screed, taking easy aim at the failure of those responsible for the \"sweet, bland commendations\" that \"fall everywhere upon the scene\" — a scene in which \"a book is born into a puddle of treacle; the brine of hostile criticism is only a memory.\" In 1963, four years after the essay was published, Hardwick and her treacle-allergic comrades founded The New York Review of Books, a proud vessel to plow through briny oceans. In \"The Decline of Book Reviewing\" she had written that \"the interest of the mind of the individual reviewer is everything,\" and those words could serve as the magazine’s credo. As these essays demonstrate, criticism should be commensurate with its subject. A piece on George Eliot, for example, begins in a way worthy of a first line by that novelist: \"She was melancholy, headachy, with a slow, disciplined, hard-won, aching genius that bore down upon her with a wondrous and exhausting force, like a great love affair in middle age.\" What follows is not, of course, a sweeping and gravid 19th-century novel about a woman seeking a life of meaning within a world of compromise, but something almost as good — a spry appraisal of a genius that is, in its own way, also a piece of writing about a woman seeking a life of meaning within a world of compromise. Eliot and Hardwick merit each other. The prickling irony of \"The Decline of Book Reviewing\" is that Hardwick’s subject, insipid writing, is not worthy of her. It’s a fool’s errand to try to make something truly good from something boringly bad. In an early review copy of this collection, the essays were ordered differently so that \"The Decline of Book Reviewing\" came first, as if to kick things off with a bellicose bang. It’s far better that the finished copy begins, instead, with \"Memoirs, Conversations, and Diaries,\" which is both more constructive and subtle, and, if we accept that any collection’s first essay is unavoidably read as a kind of manifesto, a more appropriate one for Hardwick’s mind and mode. In it, she makes appalled mention of a recent profile of Hemingway in The New Yorker: \"Before this it seemed never to have occurred to us that brute sound, as it were, might be a novelty; that ‘pieces’ may after all simply be made with words, any words, if they have been truly uttered by a person of some celebrity.\" Later, in an essay from 1991, she diagnoses her bugbear, the \"exhaustive, definitive coziness in the current American mode of entranced biographical research.\" Writing about the great Simone Weil, who died at age 34, Hardwick notes that \"the present fashion of biography, with the scrupulous accounting of time, makes a long life of a short one.\" Sylvia Plath, too, or rather, the Plath of her own biographies, is \"another example of reduction by expansion — high school, tennis lessons, dates.\" Hardwick’s own prose aspires to the converse, an expansion by reduction. She loves the asperity of an em-dash or the efficiency of a colon. Here she is, brisk and lucid and doing both as she introduces a Pulitzer Prize winner: \"The life — some scandal and a considerable amount of folly: Katherine Anne Porter was born. …\" In the third book of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan tetralogy, Lena, hitherto a deferential reader, realizes the insurrectionary potential of books: \"I never actually used them, I never turned them against themselves. This is thinking.\" Hardwick does something similar with writers; they are a way to understand other writers. Gertrude Stein, with \"her prose an intimidating heap of bare bones,\" is understood via Hemingway — there are crosscurrents of illumination. This collection is also, then, an education in 20th-century American literature; a book to send a reader to other books. Hyperbole is so strenuously resisted that when Hardwick pronounces Simone Weil’s essay \"The Iliad, or the Poem of Force\" \"one of the most moving and original essays ever written,\" it’s received as a blessed diktat: Go read now. There can be a private and wicked glee to Hardwick’s wit. Boston, for example, is not a small New York, \"as they say a child is not a small adult but is, rather, a specially organized small creature with its small-creature’s temperature, balance and distribution of fat.\" A mind delighting in itself on the page is not always palatable, but Hardwick, in doing so with such restraint, is irresistible. In one of two essays on Melville (she later wrote a book about him), she begins with a 13-clause sentence that reads like watching Simone Biles execute a sequence of back flips and somersaults; only when it’s over do you realize you’ve been holding your breath the whole time. Relief and awe rush in with the exhale. After this prolix bravura Hardwick announces, \"My own reading is largely concerned with the nature of Bartleby’s short sentences.\" I laughed out loud. Every piece of writing is autobiographical. It evinces the concerns, personality and insecurities of the writer herself. There is, as Hardwick puts it, \"the pathos of autobiography lurking in the text.\" She wrote that about Margaret Fuller, whose life (a sequence of dramas ended with a literal shipwreck) easily threatens to eclipse the text. But did Hardwick know that she was also writing about herself? Astringent and unsentimental, these essays span over half a century and, as such, constitute a monumental, if unwitting, autobiography. There is indeed a pathos in that. The literature has primacy over the life, yet the truest and most vital life is not in the facts, but the fictions.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/collected-essays-elizabeth-hardwick-darryl-pinckney.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'In ‘Nomadland,’ the Golden Years Are the Wander Years', 'text': ' NOMADLAND Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century By Jessica Bruder Illustrated. 273 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $26.95. At the steering wheel of her Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo is a silver-haired grandma named Linda May, towing her home: a secondhand, pale-yellow 10-foot-long fiberglass trailer she calls the Squeeze Inn — \"there’s room, squeeze in!\" — to a new job in a new place. At 65, Linda is houseless but not, she feels, homeless. She has raised two daughters, mostly on her own, and before heading off, she slept — feeling \"stuck\" — on the living-room couch of the rented house of her daughter and three teenage grandchildren. Formerly a long-haul trucker, a Home Depot cashier, a building inspector, an I.R.S. phone rep and a co-owner of a flooring store, Linda is heading out to a $9.35-an-hour summer job as a campground \"host.\" \"Get paid to go camping!\" the concessionaire brochure reads brightly. In the San Bernardino National Forest, she will help campers with check-in, shovel broken glass from campfire pits and mostly clean 18 toilets three times a day. Moving \"like blood cells through the veins of the country,\" Jessica Bruder writes, a growing number of older people, post-recession refugees from the middle and working class, are, like Linda, crossing the land in their Jeeps, campers and repurposed buses in search of work. We meet a 67-year-old former San Francisco taxi driver who, squeezed out by Uber, unloads truckloads of sugar beets in North Dakota. We meet Chuck, a former McDonald’s vice president who lost his home on a golf course in a gated community in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and now sells beer and hamburgers at spring training for the Oakland A’s. We meet Don, a former software executive of 69 with a white goatee, who lost his savings in the 2008 crash and lost his house in a divorce. He now lives with his dog in a 1990 Airstream and works 12-hour shifts during the pre-Christmas season at an Amazon warehouse. Other nomads \"pick raspberries in Vermont, apples in Washington and blueberries in Kentucky. They give tours at fish hatcheries, take tickets at Nascar races and guard the gates of Texas oil fields.\" Still, it has not been easy; workers mentioned hip replacements, bad knees, a minor stroke. While many live in recreational vehicles with names like Lazy Daze, these nomads do hard work for low wages, and know how to find a free shower, cut-price dentistry and discount Viagra. In this stunning and beautifully written book, Bruder, the author of \"Burning Book: A Visual History of Burning Man,\" describes her journey with Linda and her other interviews conducted in five states over three years, with more than 50 nomads in the first year alone. Bruder also worked at a beet processing plant — \"Be Part of an ‘Unbeetable’ Experience!\" in the parlance of the recruitment brochure — and describes trying to catch large beets that flew off a processing machine as akin to \"catching bowling balls in a pillowcase.\" After a while, she gets her own van and names it Halen. Bruder also worked at an Amazon fulfillment center, among workers in their 50s and up. \"We’ve had folks in their 80s who do a phenomenal job for us,\" one official for CamperForce, \"a program created by the online retailer to hire itinerant workers,\" said. \"Some walk 15 miles on concrete floors, stooping, squatting, reaching and climbing stairs as they scan, sort and box merchandise,\" Bruder notes. \"Buns of steel, here we come,\" an instructor tells gray-haired listeners. Amazon receives federal tax credit for hiring the \"disadvantaged,\" which includes those on Supplemental Security Income or food stamps. The CamperForce newsletter was upbeat: \"Make new friends and reacquaint with old ones, share good food, good stories, and good times around the campfire, or around the table. In some ways, that’s worth more than money.\" But nomads took the jobs for the money, toiling in warehouses where the summer heat could rise above 90 degrees and you could be asked to lift 50-pound loads. Amazon offered its workers free, over-the-counter pain-relief pills. How are we to understand the Lindas of our nation? Is she a latter-day Okie, like one of the Joads in \"The Grapes of Wrath\"? Perhaps, but the Joads traveled together as a family, not alone. Or does Linda resemble migrant workers from Mexico or the Philippines? Like her, many travel alone, but they often do so with an eye to settlement or return. Unlike the black migrants from the South who, over decades, moved North and West during the Great Migration, Linda — like most of those profiled in Bruder’s book — is white; she may fear poverty, but her migration isn’t propelled by racial intimidation. Linda presumably joined black and Hispanic workers in quite a few places she worked; nearly a quarter of workers in Amazon’s more than 50 warehouses across the country are black, and 12 percent Hispanic. Other of Bruder’s nomads join guest workers from abroad picking fruit. Bruder wonders why the van-dwelling community itself, though, is \"so white.\" She cannot pinpoint a definitive reason among the various possibilities she raises, though she does note that \"living in a vehicle seems like an especially dangerous gambit for anyone who might be a victim of racial profiling.\" From time to time, Linda meets other nomads at R.V. desert rallies. Among the largest ones is the Rubber Tramp Rendezvous near Quartzsite, Ariz., an annual winter \"pop-up metropolis,\" as Bruder calls it. There tens of thousands gather, some workers, some leisured, in small vans and large, parked snugly, not set apart by green lawns as they might be in a suburban tract. As in the community that blossoms around Burning Man festivals, a barber gives donation-optional haircuts. A woman offers banana-nut bread baked in her solar oven. Groups sit around bonfires to burn old bankruptcy papers and share hobo stew. It’s hard to know how many elderly van-dwellers roam the nation. Many of Bruder’s nomads had lost their homes, jobs or both in the 2008 crash. In 2010, 1,050,500 properties were repossessed. Social Security benefits are modest, Bruder reminds us, especially for women. She also tells us that, at the time of her writing, there were only a dozen American counties and one metro area where a person working full time at minimum wage could afford a one-bedroom apartment at fair market rent. What forces set these nomads in motion? Here I wish Bruder had given us a view from beyond the driver’s seat. For years, stockholders have taken the lion’s share of rising corporate profits, leaving a shrinking share to the middle- and working-class worker. The current administration and Congress aim to cut the nation’s safety net and to loosen regulations on banks, stirring fears of another devastating crash. The stage seems set to leave Americans on their own to travel a potentially bumpy economic road, a scene that would seem to fly in the face of the picket-fence stability and localism bandied about in conservative rhetoric. Republicans like to talk about \"freedom,\" but the tax reform they’re currently proposing would most likely widen the gap between rich and poor even further, reducing Linda’s freedom to stay put if she wanted to. To Linda, the American dream has been whittled down to self-sufficiency and the open road. The tires on her Jeep are worn thin, the \"check engine\" gauge doesn’t work, and she suffers occasional dizzy spells. Her gumption and work ethic seem so admirable, but her van and her health seem so precarious, her hopes so vulnerable to fate. The Lindas of America are largely invisible. When Bruder drove her own van home to Brooklyn, she began to notice vans she hadn’t noticed before — parked on a residential street, in a gas station, a store lot. As I reluctantly put down this brilliant and haunting book, I thought back to the vagabond songwriter and musician Woody Guthrie, who fled the great Oklahoma Dust Bowl of the 1930s, later riding the rails and singing, \"From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters / This land was made for you and me.\" Those huge, billowing clouds of topsoil that drove millions from their homes now seem safely tucked away in sepia-tinted photos of a bygone past. But without ominous clouds above to warn us of what lies ahead, the powerful force of automation and the destruction of any safety net may silently push more and more of us onto the open road.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/nomadland-jessica-bruder.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '‘I Can’t Breathe’: Eric Garner’s Life and Death', 'text': ' I CAN’T BREATHE A Killing on Bay Street By Matt Taibbi 322 pp. Spiegel & Grau. $28. \"Homicide\" is too simple a word for what happened to Eric Garner on that Staten Island sidewalk three years ago. Many of us would personally testify to the term’s technical accuracy, having watched, ad infinitum, the horrifying video of the 43-year-old grandfather and loose-cigarette dealer gasping for air as a New York City police officer, Daniel Pantaleo, uses a chokehold and wrestles Garner down to the pavement. Saying that the chokehold killed Garner feels incomplete. Politics, race and money play roles in nudging us all to our fates, and Garner’s demise on July 17, 2014, involved all three. Assessing his end solely based on what happened that day is tempting, given the video evidence. However, a more thorough understanding is required. Matt Taibbi, the author and Rolling Stone contributing editor, has published a new book that properly depicts the Garner killing as a consequence of our society’s ills. Its title, \"I Can’t Breathe: A Killing on Bay Street,\" seems to imply a narrow focus on the Garner killing, belying the book’s prismatic approach to both the people and policies involved in Garner’s life and death. Taibbi has recently come under renewed scrutiny for a 2000 book he co-wrote with Mark Ames, with whom he edited an English-language newspaper in 1990s Russia, in which they describe sexually harassing and assaulting their female employees. Taibbi has since posted two apologies on Facebook, saying that such passages in the book were intended as satire. Satire or not, the criticisms will no doubt be disqualifying to some readers. But one should not mistake a review of this book on Garner with an endorsement of the author or his previous work. This time, as Taibbi wrote in one of his Facebook posts, he found a story that \"had to be told without my voice, without linguistic cartwheels or jokes or any of the other circus tricks I learned to use.\" Indeed, \"I Can’t Breathe\" is a work of deep reporting, as chapter by chapter, Taibbi introduces us to individual players — from Garner’s fellow street hustlers in the beleaguered Tompkinsville section of Staten Island to activists who protested the grand jury’s refusal to indict Pantaleo (a man whom we also get to know much better, as Taibbi unearths what he can of his past). The story of the Garners’ tumultuous and often combative family life is told by people who were there, including Garner’s daughter Erica, an activist. In this book, humanization does not equal lionization, and sympathy is never confused for pity. This applies to everyone, in particular the book’s principal subject. Though he aims to flesh out and contextualize what happened to Garner, this may be the most critical look at the man himself. Every fault, compulsion and bad choice is presented in full relief. Still, as Taibbi writes early on, \"Eric Garner may have created a lot of his own problems, but he was also the victim of bad luck and atrocious timing.\" It is impossible to understand how society’s pressures and inequities wore Garner down without examining an obsession with providing for his family that went so deep that he ignored his own needs. But Taibbi’s reportorial voice, often blunt and forceful, is most compassionate when he is integrating political realities with facts about Garner and the incidents depicted. Taibbi describes in full the horrors of institutionalized poverty in neighborhoods like Tompkinsville, from the real-estate scams that created them to the overseer mentality of the police patrolling them. Crooked landlords and legal quagmires all shaped Garner’s world. Taibbi is smart to depict the structurally racist system of law enforcement in this country as a character in and of itself. The misguided and destructive \"broken windows\" policing tactic is portrayed here as Frankenstein’s monster, built with good intentions without thought to tragic consequences. \"Right or wrong, the threat of being stopped went from an annoyance to a thing that took over his life,\" Taibbi writes. Like the Moirai of Greek mythology, other people made political choices that directed the course of Garner’s life and accelerated its end. The first half of the book, as it progresses, feels increasingly like a train without brakes that is rolling downhill. If readers are unfamiliar with the fatalism and frustration that racial discrimination, poverty and poor policing engender in men like Eric Garner, Taibbi provides an able introduction.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/i-cant-breathe-matt-taibbi-eric-garner.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Life, Love and Mortality in the City of Light', 'text': ' PARIS IN THE PRESENT TENSE By Mark Helprin 394 pp. The Overlook Press. $28.95. With a sure sense that drama is contrast, Mark Helprin’s new novel about Paris begins in that city’s mighty opposite, New York. And not in the light that is Paris’s hallmark but in the darkness above Manhattan as Air France 017, heading eastward, splits \"a path through the night, rising and falling more smoothly than a boat on a gently rolling sea.\" This is only the first of the innumerable contrasts wrapped helix-like around the story of Jules Lacour, a septuagenarian cellist of extraordinary sensitivity and gloominess (he is French, after all). There is the contrast of the evanescence of music — \"born into the air only instantly to die\" — and the absoluteness of silence. There is the contrast of men and women (he is French, after all), of coarse America and subtle Europe, of Jew and gentile, of the Nazi past in which his parents perished and the ominous present in which his grandson, Luc, lies dying of leukemia. And finally there is the contrast of youth and age, for although Jules falls in love instantly and often — in Raymond Chandler’s words, he’s about as hard to get as a haircut — he falls most hopelessly for his beautiful young student Élodi, who is entering life just as he is increasingly aware of his own evanescence. In other words, \"Paris in the Present Tense\" is a novel about love, and therefore about loss. If these are clichés — what’s more threadbare than May and December, student and amorous teacher? — Helprin revitalizes them with the energy of his language. A rhetorician might slice his prose style into scraps of Greek — asyndeton here, hypotaxis there — but that would fail to account for the intensely lyrical voice that both heightens and deepens every sentence, at times attaining a kind of Joycean beauty: \"The compassionate dead looking on were infinitely wiser than the living, so many of whom never stopped for an instant as they thrashed through life like fish in a net.\" Part of this force comes from the images that fly off Helprin’s sentences like glitter from a sparkler. (Motorcycle riders are \"helmeted like bugs.\" Antennas on a roof shake in \"aluminum hysteria.\") Part of it comes from the sensuality of Jules’s response to the physical world around him — the erotic flow of cloth over body in a flight attendant’s uniform or as simple a thing as the burning of a stack of wood, in which he sees a \"ballet of rising smoke.\" And especially there is his response to color and motion. As he runs toward the novel’s climax, Jules hears all around the music of his life, gathering \"everything he knew and had known,\" turning it into \"a massive whirlwind of red and silver light\" and then into \"a lion of fire, the sun’s leaping corona.\" This is not to say the novel is without flaws. The plot moves andante. Maddening coincidences will elicit a groan. Characters confuse conversation with autobiography. Jules’s self-absorption leads to occasional passages of wearying profundity, when the golden sentences begin to fray. And, as always, the comic — Helprin’s heavy-handed satire of Americans — shows itself the enemy of the lyric. You never know what is enough, Blake said, unless you know what is too much. But Helprin’s generosity of language and emotion allows room for missteps as well as brilliance. His Paris does exist in the present tense, irresistibly, undeniably real and alive, as though summoned by its creator rather than imagined. In this, the novel performs perfectly the function of literature, which is not to escape the world but to enter more completely into it.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/mark-helprin-paris-in-the-present-tense.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Soccer Novel More About the Players Than the Play', 'text': ' We associate literary risk with aesthetic dazzle: formal experimentation; idiosyncratic language.

Tom is gay, and his simmering affair with the groundskeeper, Liam, conducted in excruciating secrecy away from the macho banter and ritualized bonding of his teammates, edges him even further from a sense of belonging. \"A Natural\" is overtly concerned with shame. It picks at the conflict between socially conditioned masculinity and gay desire. As is noticeable in the sex scenes between Tom and Liam, this is a space in which pleasure is seemingly impossible: \"He was unhesitant, aggressive, forcing Liam’s cheek flat against the top of the trestle table and watching with hot revulsion his pale lips stretching, catching against his teeth. … He moved his hands to Liam’s neck and felt the breath constricting inside his throat, the need rising again to make him hurt, to make himself hurt, to know without any doubt that he was abnormal, worthless.\" For about a third of the novel, this feels uncomfortable. Raisin risks diluting queer experience to a washed-out sadness. In emphasizing shame over pleasure, he gave this reader concern that a distinctly heteronormative gaze was being manipulated. Can straight male readers empathize with gay life only by imagining how awful, how shameful it must feel to be a gay man? Or is queerness here merely a lens, an angle by which to view straight masculinity? Raisin also gambles with narrative stasis. Tom spends very little time playing football. Instead, he watches from the reserves bench, first injured, then sidelined by more talented teammates. This becomes a novel not of action but of inaction, or action thwarted. As the book progresses, though, Raisin’s careful path through self-imposed pitfalls becomes clear. The way is lit by his keen perceptions; the novel suggests the frustrations that arise when lived experience fails to align with what was imagined, and analyzes the gap between spectatorship and participation. For Tom, his experience of playing or not playing football never quite matches his experience of watching football from the stands and imagining himself playing it. Although Raisin never says as much overtly, the sex in this book follows the same pattern: Reality can never be fantasy; pain and disappointment will always intrude. What enables Raisin to navigate such fraught terrain is his deep and unwavering empathy for others, and an ability to find flashes of beauty in life’s unforgiving ugliness. His language might be spare, but his turn of phrase is strikingly elegant. A view over the town reveals \"the cracked spines of terraced roofs\"; a man’s exertion results in \"taut white maggots of flesh beading on his forehead\"; the bags under a character’s eyes are \"two little beards of ruined skin.\" At the same time, the quality that hampers Raisin’s young hopefuls — doubt — is entirely absent from his writing. His commitment to a flattened emotional affect beautifully mirrored by a gray, featureless English landscape might be risky, but it is total, and the confidence and skill with which he pursues his vision is not just persuasive, it’s powerful. By its end, \"A Natural,\" having set off at such a restrained pace, builds to a painful and claustrophobic tension, until the reader wills for the characters the very thing their misfortune for so long denies them: release, escape, liberation. If Raisin has chosen to focus on that which stifles rather than frees us, he has done so to demonstrate precisely why we need all the things that society and circumstance suppress.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/ross-raisin-natural.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'After ‘Mad Men,’ Matthew Weiner Turns to a Novel of Madmen', 'text': ' HEATHER, THE TOTALITY By Matthew Weiner 138 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $25. If television shows really have replaced the novel as the preferred mirror for our busy lives, then Matthew Weiner is surely one reason. As the creator of \"Mad Men\" and a major contributor to \"The Sopranos,\" Weiner has done as much as anyone to prove that TV drama can be as emotionally rich and formally artful as any first-rate novel, while at the same time offering all the senses-saturating enchantment of great cinema. The combination is powerful enough to have put just about every novelist I know into a state of at least mild crisis. How can we possibly compete? It comes as a surprise, then, that Weiner has turned to the form he’s helped speed toward redundancy, for his latest project, \"Heather, the Totality.\" Of course, with his gift for the steady disclosure of complicated characters and his keen ear for the subtexts of human interactions, he ought to be a natural. Still, it’s an interestingly counterintuitive move. In a note on the novel’s origins, Weiner recalls: \"I walked past this beautiful schoolgirl going into a building under construction, and I saw a man working there stare at her with threatening intensity. … What I wrote down was, What if her father saw that?\" The book stays faithful to this initiating vision. Schoolgirl, Worker and Father are duly sketched out, imbued with the qualities of vulnerability, creepy lust and paternal jealousy required by their respective roles, and set in motion toward that ill-omened encounter. There’s also a Mother (the caps are the author’s), and the foursome make up pretty much the entire cast. It’s a brisk, undemanding read, with alternating sections on the family (rich, tame) and the Worker (poor, psychopathic) creating an efficient mechanism of suspense. The cogs don’t actually mesh until over halfway through, which is a little late, but the question of who is going to do what to whom keeps you queasily engaged, especially after the Worker modifies his plan of rape and murder in favor of something more florid. And yet, it has to be said, the book also seems seriously at odds with itself, in all kinds of ways. Its extreme brevity (a mere 138 pages) suggests an ambition to join the company of those swift, spare thrillers that deploy a diagrammatic precision and economy of detail to uncannily powerful effect (Josephine Hart’s \"Damage\" and Tim Krabbé’s \"The Vanishing\" come to mind). But a countervailing expansiveness — whereby Weiner crams a full chronicle of the 15-plus years of Mark and Karen Breakstone’s marital ups and downs, career fluctuations and childhood memories into the book’s tight confines — works against that minimizing impulse. The result is a strange mixture of curtness and bagginess, with far more information about Mark and Karen’s unremarkable lives than the story needs, delivered in far denser chunks than the reader can digest with any pleasure. Here’s a typical passage: \"His Father found him lacking in aggression and eventually gave up bullying him, finding him best suited for supporting the real warriors, like a girl. Mark did eventually show some athletic ability in cross-country running, which required psychological discipline but was solitary and dismissive of the teamwork his Father thought most valuable. By junior year Mark knew that he preferred to be quietly competitive and that he didn’t get along with men because he hated the anonymous place they assigned him when they were in groups.\" Despite this expository abundance, the characters remain oddly vague. Mark (whose corporate job is never fully described, making it hard to care deeply about his shifting financial fortunes) comes across as a dull milquetoast one minute, a conniving manipulator the next. Karen veers between snooty poise and mousy social neurosis. Heather, the daughter, is distinguished by a precocious empathy that prompts her, aged 5, to tell a woman (or rather a Woman) on the subway: \"You shouldn’t be sad even if your bags are heavy. I can carry one.\" But Weiner seems undecided whether to present this as a sympathetic trait (it’s part of what draws Bobby, the Worker, to her) or an obnoxious one (which is how it actually reads), and so in between assuring us of the girl’s miraculous radiance, he sends out what appear to be winking invitations to laugh at her. All three are strikingly bland, even in the middle-school pettiness of their preoccupations with looks, possessions and status. Bobby is more vivid, with some gruesome accomplishments in his résumé, but even he remains a generic figure, built from familiar components (poverty, drugs, abuse) all handled with a conspicuous lack of nuance and zero attempt at imaginative sympathy with the world he comes from: \"Having Bobby did little to alter his Mother’s belief that heroin was the best thing in her life.\" Why Weiner should have wanted to devote time to such a depleted, rudimentary collection of human beings is a mystery. This is the creator of Don Draper! None of it is helped by what seems a studied disregard for the one useful, if hoary, piece of received wisdom about fiction writing, that it is generally better to show than tell. There’s almost no showing in the entire book; little real-time action or direct speech. You keep waiting for a fully imagined scene with the kind of immersive detail that persuades you of the reality (to borrow Nabokov’s phrase) of what is going on. But even on the rare occasions when one arrives, or seems to, it quickly switches gear into a synopsis-like reporting of things: \"One night, after a very expensive bottle of wine, while they lay spent in the after, Karen told Mark that other women had never used her as a measure because she easily receded in groups, most comfortable as an approving spectator.\" The effect is to give the events a muffled, offstage quality; the last thing you’d expect from a world-class dramatist. It may be that the habits of mind of a writer accustomed to the luxury of accomplished actors and lavish sets to flesh out his ideas simply don’t lend themselves to the novel, where words have to do it all. But I think the problem has more to with a fundamental uncertainty (again) on Weiner’s part as to precisely what disturbed him about that scene he observed on the street. There are some pithy social observations that suggest an interest in using the encounter for purposes of class satire in the manner of Tom Wolfe, but aside from a running theme about coffee consumption, the book never commits to a sustained look at the specifics of contemporary life. Occasionally a deadpan drollness, reminiscent of George Saunders, flickers in the prose, hinting at a possible interest in doing gothicky Americana, but that’s also fitful. It isn’t that every suspense story has to have some higher purpose. Playing it for pure chills would have been fine by me, but even there the book seems undecided, offering titillating suggestions of incest and darker transgressions one moment, only to back off the next, as if finding itself too squeamish, after all, to go there. What you’re left with is just that calibrated convergence of predator and prey. It holds your attention, but it doesn’t leave you with much.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/books/review/matthew-weiner-heather-the-totality.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Why the Greek Bailout Went So Wrong', 'text': ' ADULTS IN THE ROOM My Battle With the European and American Deep Establishment By Yanis Varoufakis 550 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $28. In 2010, Greece was insolvent. The profligacy of Greek governments and the staggering laxity of lenders after the country joined the European common currency in 2001 had left it with huge debts that, in the aftermath of a global recession, it could no longer afford to service. Countries in such straits usually go through ad hoc bankruptcies known as sovereign debt crises, in which the currency is devalued and debts defaulted upon and/or written down. These can be messy, but they do at least allow for fresh starts. Short of leaving the euro, a move with no precedent or procedure and a high risk of cascading chaos, this was not an option for Greece. So in May 2010, the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund stepped in with what was characterized as a 110 billion euro ($146 billion at the time) bailout. It wasn’t so much a bailout of Greece, though, as of its lenders, notably the struggling big banks of France and Germany. Greece still owed an impossible amount of money, only now its main creditors were the \"troika\" of E.C., E.C.B. and I.M.F., which went on to impose harsh austerity measures. That austerity accelerated Greece’s economic decline, making repayment of its debts even less likely. More bailouts that weren’t exactly bailouts followed. \"Fiscal waterboarding\" is the name that the University of Athens economist Yanis Varoufakis gave to this process, after the torture method that simulates near-drowning again and again. And just as intelligence experts generally don’t think waterboarding is an effective way to extract information, it is hard to find an outside economic or financial expert who thinks the troika’s Greece policy has been effective or sensible. So why has it continued? This is the most important question Varoufakis sets out to answer in this account of the six months he spent as Greece’s finance minister in 2015. \"Adults in the Room\" is several things: a gripping tale of an outspoken intellectual’s sudden immersion in high-stakes politics, an at times overwrought riposte to the many people in and outside Greece who derided his efforts and a solid work of explanatory economics. Most of all, though, it is an attempt to divine why smart, seemingly decent politicians and bureaucrats would continue pushing a pointlessly cruel approach long after its pointlessness had become clear. The book’s subtitle (\"My Battle With the European and American Deep Establishment\") might lead a reader to expect all manner of sinister machinations. But while there are a few internal Greek political plots that can be fairly described as conspiracies, at the international level it’s mainly what Varoufakis calls \"an authentic drama … reminiscent of a play by Aeschylus or Shakespeare in which powerful schemers end up caught in a trap of their own making.\" At the outset of the narrative, the former United States Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers asks Varoufakis in a dimly lit hotel bar in Washington, D.C., whether he is an \"insider\" or \"outsider,\" warning that outsiders (those who \"prioritize their freedom to speak their version of the truth\") tend to have a hard time getting anything accomplished in government. Varoufakis was and is obviously an outsider. He had made his name with colorful critiques of Greek and European economic policies. Even as he allied himself with Alexis Sipras and his leftist Syriza Party to run for office in January 2015, he didn’t actually join the party. And once in office he continued to behave in ways that finance ministers aren’t supposed to, tooling around Athens on his Yamaha XJR motorcycle and famously showing up for a meeting on Downing Street in a too-tight, too-bright blue shirt and a leather overcoat described by one British fashion writer as a \"drug dealer’s coat.\" That bold fashion statement, Varoufakis recounts, was unintentional — the result of leaving his suitcase in a cab in Athens two days before. Arriving in Paris on a Saturday evening after most stores had closed, he had to make do with a couple of shirts from Zara and a coat borrowed from the Greek ambassador to France. So Varoufakis wasn’t always trying to make waves. And he seems to have approached his chief task with great seriousness. He got Summers on his side, with the Harvard economist frequently emailing and calling with advice and information. Playing an even bigger role was Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia, who helped Varoufakis craft his debt restructuring proposals and accompanied him to meetings with European and I.M.F. officials. James Galbraith of the University of Texas, who had brought Varoufakis to Austin as a visiting professor, holed up at the finance ministry in Athens to develop contingency plans for a Greek exit from the euro. Other members of Varoufakis’s kitchen cabinet included the former chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont (a Tory), the former Deutsche Bank chief economist Thomas Mayer and even, on occasion, the French economy minister (now president) Emmanuel Macron. This was no amateur hour. That the effort nonetheless ended in failure seems to have been only partly about that insider-outsider thing. A bigger obstacle was political deadlock in the country that now calls almost all the shots in Europe. Varoufakis had hoped to engineer an orderly bankruptcy for Greece within the euro, with the country’s debts significantly reduced and austerity scaled back. Failing that, though, he was willing to pull Greece out of the euro and go the sovereign-debt-crisis route. The German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble, the dominant figure in European financial affairs, openly favored the latter course. His harsh but not entirely unreasonable view was that it had been a mistake to let Greece into the eurozone, and that the only way forward was for Greece to leave. Chancellor Angela Merkel, on the other hand, was unwilling to contemplate a \"Grexit\" that might lead to an unraveling of the common currency. But she was also unwilling or unable to force Schäuble to offer a better deal to Greece. The result, as Varoufakis writes: \"Stalemate!\" Reinforcing the stalemate was what Varoufakis calls the \"eurozone runaround,\" the repeated protestations from officials at the E.C., E.C.B. and I.M.F. that, while they sympathized with Greece’s plight and agreed with many of Varoufakis’s recommendations, they alone couldn’t change the troika’s course. Jack Lew, then the United States Treasury secretary, similarly offered sympathetic words but made clear that he had no interest in crossing the Germans. The end finally came in July 2015, when — right after 61 percent of Greek voters decided to reject the latest \"bailout\" from the troika — a fearful Sipras chose nonetheless to submit. Varoufakis resigned after that. Varoufakis does a magnificent job of evoking the absurdities and frustrations of his tenure. This is what it’s like to go from meeting to interminable meeting for six months, trying and failing to negotiate your country’s way out of a terrible impasse. At least, this is what Varoufakis says it was like. I did wonder on occasion how much I could trust his play-by-play. I’m reviewing this book, not fact-checking it, but I couldn’t resist asking Summers for his assessment of the opening scene in the hotel bar. \"Somewhat embellished,\" was the verdict. Leaving aside whether Varoufakis’s recollections might be more accurate than those of a man who has met with so many embattled finance ministers over the past quarter century that he has probably lost count, I’m good with that. A truth somewhat embellished is still pretty much the truth.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/yanis-varoufakis-adults-in-the-room.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Journey of Belonging', 'text': ' REAL AMERICAN A Memoir By Julie Lythcott-Haims 272 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $27 Earlier this year, the movie \"Get Out\" established a psychological purgatory called the \"sunken place,\" where black people who have been hijacked by white people are frozen in a Munch-like anguish, a silent scream. But there also exists an anguished place for mixed-race people who can’t figure out where they belong, or how to talk about that confusion. In America, mixed-race identity tends to invite both curiosity and suspicion, largely because few have found a way to interrogate it without centering whiteness as the scale by which to evaluate blackness. Those who fumble at this examination are burned online. (For recent examples, Google \"race and Tinashe\" or \"race and painting and Zadie Smith.\") It’s with this trepidation that I approached \"Real American,\" Julie Lythcott-Haims’s new memoir about growing up biracial. But any fears that I initially had about the book were laid to rest by two gut-wrenching lines near the beginning that show the author intends to probe not her blackness but rather America’s perception of it. \"I come from people who survived what America did to them,\" she writes. \"I’m so American it hurts.\" Lythcott-Haims, the author of \"How to Raise an Adult,\" was the dean of freshmen at Stanford University, and she began writing poetry in 2007, after reading Lucille Clifton; the pacing of \"Real American,\" staccato at times, rushed and frenetic at others, infuses the book with a lyricism that hums with the frustration and sadness she felt growing up what she calls \"un-Black.\" Her feelings metamorphose into palpable anger and resentment as she reaches adulthood, and she finally begins to grasp the perversity of a system that tries to undermine black Americans from the moment they arrive in the world. What sets Lythcott-Haims’s book apart from others is that she doesn’t seem to be contextualizing the experience for white people — she’s working through the issues that she’s faced all her life, unpacking them in an effort to isolate and extract them, as a surgeon might inspect a cancerous cluster of cells before excision. The most moving parts of \"Real American\" come when Lythcott-Haims stares unflinchingly at her own self-loathing, writing about the racist encounters of her childhood that convinced her from a young age that there was something inherently wrong with being black. She walks the reader through a journey of belonging, of trying to construct a sense of self amid the backdrop of a virtually all-white Wisconsin town and eventually stepping into her identity as a black woman, which happened for her as an undergraduate at Stanford University — meeting other black and mixed-race kids who could offer a template for being. She reveals the painful process of unlearning and psychic deprogramming that black people in America must navigate in order to undo the rhetoric of a culture that attempts to condition them to think they are inferior. She talks about the surreal disorientation she experiences when a (white) neighbor mistakes her (black) father for a gardener. She recalls how she tries to make herself palatable and less threatening as she moves through the world, delivering \"a reassuring smile\" to salesclerks in a department store \"that says I’m Black, but I’m not here to steal from you.\" She recounts what it feels like to come of age as the only black student in her high school class, the way she inherits the assumption she must not be pretty or attractive, and the looks she receives after marrying a white man. Here, the book threatens to veer into that \"sunken place,\" as Lythcott-Haims laments giving birth to a fair-skinned daughter, whom she names Avery. She takes Avery outside, holding her up to the strong California sun. \"Darken her. Make her mine,\" Lythcott-Haims writes. \"I felt her lightness lessened my Blackness,\" she continues, as if racial identity were contained in a skin tone. But she saves it with vulnerability, with a stunning and painful admission. \"I wasn’t ashamed of Avery,\" she concedes. \"I was ashamed to be me.\" These feelings of self-loathing — that she felt uncomfortable being black, was even afraid of other black people — are not easy things to admit, but important and inherent and instructive to understanding how a culture of whiteness can affect a person of color. Lythcott-Haims never comes to a tidy conclusion about how to view race relations in America, because there isn’t one. By allowing us to witness a woman coming to terms with herself, and finding nothing but pride and love there, she offers a blueprint for how others might try to do the same.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/real-american-julie-lythcott-haims-memoir.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Bowling, Football and Edna St. Vincent Millay', 'text': ' GEORGE & LIZZIE By Nancy Pearl 278 pp. Touchstone. $25. The retired librarian Nancy Pearl loves books. In fact, Library Journal named her librarian of the year in 2011. She appears on public radio to talk about books, has a monthly television show in Seattle called \"Book Lust With Nancy Pearl\" and is also the author of \"Book Lust,\" a collection of recommended \"reading for every mood, moment and reason.\" With this in mind, approaching \"George & Lizzie,\" Pearl’s first novel, feels like heading out to sea with a collector of nautical charts. You assume she appreciates them very much, and that she knows how to use them. Or you hope. Because no one wants to see an ardent lover of maps end up in a mud flat. Sailing along with \"George & Lizzie,\" I often clutched at its sides, sure the vessel’s rigging was off-kilter. Occasionally I felt queasy, unsure of the direction we were heading. But the prose was sturdy and the subject matter provocative. Pearl makes regular references to other books, and I clung to our shared favorites (like Dodie Smith’s old-fashioned tale of English girlhood, \"I Capture the Castle\") as if to a life preserver. \"George & Lizzie\" is a peculiar romance since it charts a relationship in which one party, Lizzie, is merely going through the motions. Watching a person take someone else (i.e., George) for granted can be dreary. But this isn’t happening in a sad, Swedish, Ingmar Bergman kind of way; rather, it’s infused with an American rom-com cheeriness. George and Lizzie meet at an Ann Arbor bowling alley in the early 1990s. She’s a sophomore at the University of Michigan, majoring in English. He’s studying to be a dentist. She’s self-medicating a broken heart with pot; he’s distracted because he’s out with his dream girl from dental school. Yet soon George and Lizzie start dating. Lizzie has a secret. In high school, also in Ann Arbor, where her emotionally detached parents are psychology professors at the university, she slept with every one of the starters on the football team. Her best friend, Andrea, had proposed the idea as a way to be adventurous, \"like a sign that we really lived.\" The next day, Andrea sensibly declared her own plan \"nuts.\" But Lizzie plowed ahead with what they called the Great Game, doggedly working through the lineup from the middle of September until the middle of April. \"It was a chore, like slogging through ‘Vanity Fair’ had been the previous year.\" (Sing it, sister.) From one of Pearl’s detours into Woody-Allenesque whimsy, a list of \"Why George Loves Lizzie,\" we know that he adores Lizzie beyond all things (her breasts enter the list at No. 4). But her fear is that any man who knows about this dicey episode from her past won’t be able to see beyond it — and she has some evidence to support that theory. Her first college boyfriend, Jack McConaghey, dumped her after he found out about the Great Game. And Jack was a catch: a sensitive soul who shared her admiration for A. E. Housman and was at least open to reading her beloved Edna St. Vincent Millay (unlike her misogynistic professor, who calls Millay \"That, ‘Oh God, the pain’ girl?\"). Lizzie’s longing for Jack steers the narrative for years thereafter. Poor George. Poor Lizzie. The Great Game is her great trauma. It merits more examination than it gets, if only to persuade us that it’s plausible. Pearl punctuates her narrative with descriptions of the players and their positions (\"the kicker,\" \"the strong safety\" and so on) but they’re just a muddle of eager, clumsy, amiable boys. Even though Lizzie is stubborn, even considering that her cartoonish parents treated her like a psych experiment, it doesn’t seem conceivable that she would play this game. \"I guess I wonder why you did it,\" Jack tells her. \"It just doesn’t seem like you.\" What does jibe is the way Lizzie’s feelings for Jack warp her life. He’s the romantic Holy Grail, and her obstinate belief in their short, long-gone relationship is at the center of this strangely conceived yet ultimately endearing novel. Pearl succeeds in showing how hard it is for Lizzie to combat its power. Offering oneself up for the pleasure of a team of football players has to be one of the weirdest premises ever devised for a romantic novel. Pearl’s steering may be off, but let it not be said that she’s afraid of uncharted waters.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/george-lizzie-nancy-pearl.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A History of Humanity Told Through Genetics', 'text': ' A BRIEF HISTORY OF EVERYONE WHO EVER LIVED The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes By Adam Rutherford 416 pp. The Experiment. $25.95. A recent and, even by its own lofty standards, especially hilarious and cringingly tasteless episode of \"South Park\" features the passionate and petulant schlimazel, middle-aged dad Randy Marsh, watching TV, when a commercial for a fictional consumer genetics company comes on the screen. \"Wouldn’t you like to know the story of you?\" the unctuous announcer asks. \"What makes you you?\" We then see a parade of white people doing entitled white people things — biking, painting, jogging — as they give testimonials about their DNA test results. All are thrilled to find out that their genomes have revealed them to be not just plain vanilla boring Caucasians, but rather to have some fraction of exotic — and more important, persecuted — ancestry. \"I’m 21-percent victim!\" exclaims one satisfied customer. A reference to \"South Park\" would be right at home in Adam Rutherford’s impressive history of humanity as told by its DNA, \"A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived\" (published in Britain last year and now updated for this American edition). Without ever undermining his seriousness of purpose, Rutherford himself alludes to an earlier episode of \"South Park,\" along with the early ’80s TV show \"Fame,\" the comedian Eddie Izzard and a B-side by Tupac, among various other pop-culture touchstones. This is not a textbook (although it should be). The other reason the \"South Park\" set piece fits right in with Rutherford’s message is that he is cleareyed about exactly what genetics can and cannot tell us about ourselves and why those limitations so often leave us wanting more. \"Our desire for these stories fuels the companies that sell them,\" he writes. Sometimes the genetic ancestry data live up to the hype (the unearthing of Richard III from beneath a London parking garage and subsequent sequencing of his DNA) and sometimes they don’t (the recent and wholly unconvincing DNA identification of Jack the Ripper). As popular science writing, \"A Brief History\" is nothing less than a tour de force — a heady amalgam of science, history, a little bit of anthropology and plenty of nuanced, captivating storytelling. While Rutherford, a geneticist, science writer and broadcaster, makes both his ambition and cheekiness clear in the title, he somehow manages to deliver on its great promise. He takes us back to the beginnings of the most recent iteration of humanity in Africa circa 300,000 years ago and fills us in on all of the other ancient hominins who preceded — and in a couple of cases had sex with — Homo sapiens, but he does so in such an entertaining and engaging fashion that the book never feels pedantic. Over the last 150 years genetics has developed in part at the hands of fallible and occasionally bigoted human beings. Here too, and especially on questions of race and racism, Rutherford does not avert his gaze. While Charles Darwin became a fervent abolitionist, his half cousin, the brilliant and arrogant Francis Galton, became something else. In addition to world-changing statistical concepts (correlation, regression toward the mean), Galton came up with the term \"eugenics\" and then practiced what he preached, hoping, for example, to keep those without superior ability or inheritance from procreating. He also coined the phrase \"Nature versus nurture,\" which, Rutherford reminds us, \"has plagued geneticists ever since.\" The distinct possibility that we are currently repeating it notwithstanding, the sorry history of 20th-century eugenics is well-plowed ground. Thankfully Rutherford’s wise, funny and occasionally cranky narrative visits lots of other places. Beyond giving us pop-culture Easter eggs, he is able to render esoteric and unfortunately named aspects of the science of inheritance (hi there, linkage disequilibrium!) in ways that give the lay reader a sense of how genetics works without yet another ninth-grade exhumation of Gregor Mendel. So long pea plants and fruit flies, hello earwax, lactose intolerance and a bunch of geneticists in a bar creating a betting pool for how many genes would turn out to be present in the human genome (spoiler: fewer than any of them thought). Ever the scientist, Rutherford never sacrifices data on the altar of a good story: \"A Brief History\" is full of qualifiers, complications and \"we just don’t know\" that will no doubt disappoint white supremacists and genetic determinists of all stripes. \"Ancestry is messy and difficult,\" he writes. \"Genetics is messy and mathematical, but powerful if deployed in the right way. People are horny. Lives are complex. A secret history is truly hidden in the mosaics of our genomes, but caveat emptor.\" If genetics can ever offer us words to live by, I reckon these are probably the best it can do.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/brief-history-everyone-who-ever-lived-adam-rutherford.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'An Expert on Warfare Examines Centuries of Evolving Mayhem', 'text': ' THE FUTURE OF WAR A History By Lawrence Freedman 376 pp. PublicAffairs. $30. When it mattered most, the next war was too awful to imagine. In 1933, the year Adolf Hitler took power in Germany, an influential French author warned what might happen: \"A hundred planes each carrying a ton of asphyxiating shells would cover Paris with a gas sheet 20 meters high, all in an hour.\" To a French public preoccupied with aerial bombardment and chemical warfare, much of the appeal of appeasing Nazi Germany was that the alternative was unthinkable. To justify selling out Czechoslovakia to Hitler in 1938, Neville Chamberlain played on similar fears among the British, emphasizing how \"horrible, fantastic, incredible\" it was that a foreign quarrel led to \"trying on gas masks here.\" In \"The Future of War,\" Lawrence Freedman offers a field manual to how past generations of Americans and Britons envisioned their conflicts to come. Again and again, they were blindsided by the conflagrations that upended their societies and wrecked their orderly lives — much as people today would be dumbfounded by an armageddon exploding from the Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Straits, the Persian Gulf or the Baltics. \"History,\" he writes, \"is made by people who do not know what is going to happen next.\" The oracles usually got it wrong. It’s hard enough to understand wars when you’re in the middle of them, as demonstrated daily in Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen; it’s tougher still to predict what future combat will be like. Freedman — an emeritus professor at King’s College London, one of Britain’s pre-eminent strategic thinkers and a former member of its official Iraq war inquiry — argues that the prognosticators often expect to limit the destructiveness of the next war through a surprise knockout blow. But they tend to overlook what happens if that first salvo doesn’t win a quick victory, underestimating the salience of demographics and economic capacity while overestimating citizens’ willingness to keep on fighting and dying in a prolonged struggle. Bloody stalemates at the front can spark revolutions, mutinies or civil wars at home. Insightful and opinionated, Freedman charges from the interstate wars of the 19th century to the Cold War to attempts to make sense of civil strife in the 1990s, ending with current fears about clashes with great powers like Russia or China using high-tech weaponry. He expertly covers centuries of evolving mayhem, from brutal European colonial wars to present-day counterterrorism, cyberwar and urban gang violence. Two of the seers who pop up in Freedman’s fascinating pages are Defense Secretary James Mattis, then a Marine Corps general puzzling over how to fight against irregular forces, and Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, now the White House national security adviser, appearing as an acidic skeptic about military technology. Another one is Freedman himself: With no small British coyness, he quotes and praises a major doctrinal speech about military intervention by Tony Blair, burying in an endnote the fact that he helped the prime minister to write it. Freedman is eclectically curious not merely about the predictions of generals, spooks and nuclear strategists, but also novelists, from Arthur Conan Doyle — who in 1914 wrote a prescient potboiler about German submarines sinking British civilian ships — to a chilling 1958 novel of nuclear annihilation that became the basis for Stanley Kubrick’s film \"Dr. Strangelove.\" The greatest of these futurist authors was H. G. Wells, an antiwar progressive who in the early years of the 20th century dreamed up a battle tank and imagined German airships bombing American cities. His famous \"War of the Worlds,\" about a Martian colonization of England, was a caustic parable denouncing European empires. After recently waging \"a war of extermination\" on outgunned Tasmanians, Wells wrote, how can we \"complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\" Having spent a lifetime studying wars, Freedman doesn’t expect to see the end of them. Resolutely skeptical, he’s particularly tough on those who believe that war is becoming obsolete, from the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Norman Angell — whose popular book arguing that warfare was economically futile came out a few years before the outbreak of World War I — to the excellent psychologist Steven Pinker today. Sobered by the ferocity of nationalist passions, he’s wary of idealistic efforts to criminalize warfare and supplant power politics with international law. He’s unimpressed by the prominent conventions created at The Hague in 1899 and 1907, which to this day remain a foundational legal limitation on belligerents at war, arguing that their logic \"was not to outlaw war but to make it more palatable by smoothing down its rougher edges.\" Military necessity, he thinks, will override legal restraints. Richly exploring American and British futurology, the book has less to say about strategic forecasting elsewhere. Do the Chinese, Indians, Russians and Egyptians stumble into the same mental traps? There’s an important Asian case in point, mentioned only briefly here, that strongly supports Freedman’s warnings against delusions of knockout battles: Japan in World War II. Plotting their surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese militarists hoped to win some quick victories and then negotiate peace on more favorable terms. Gen. Hideki Tojo, then the army minister and later prime minister, said, \"Occasionally one must conjure up enough courage, close one’s eyes and jump off the platform of the Kiyomizu\" — a lofty ancient temple in Kyoto. When, as more prudent Japanese officials had feared, the war degenerated into an unwinnable competition against overwhelming American industrial power, the militaristic leadership kept trying and failing to score one decisive battlefield victory — not at Saipan, nor Luzon, nor Leyte. Today the allure of a swift victory comes packaged in new military technologies combining information with more accurate targeting from afar, killing enemies without endangering American soldiers. Freedman is unbeguiled by our current tech obsession. While studies of the evolution of warfare have often concentrated on newfangled weaponry like machine guns, nuclear submarines or artificial intelligence, he spurns the \"constant temptation to believe that there were technical fixes for what were essentially political problems.\" Although he sees tactical advantages to aerial drones — they can hover over a remote target for hours, and they don’t get scared or traumatized if a nearby drone gets blown up — it still takes old-fashioned armies to hold territory and establish order. In Afghanistan and Iraq, American troops have found themselves mired in counterinsurgency campaigns amid the civilian populations, getting killed by low-tech improvised booby traps. At the same time, terrorist groups have also innovated, with Hezbollah modernizing itself into a hybrid force of guerrillas, anti-tank fighters, information specialists and armed drones. This book makes especially disquieting reading under a president who acts like an overwritten character from those dystopian novels. It’s likely enough that Donald Trump will get into a war, possibly a sizable one, as did Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush before him. A military crisis will pose strategic, cognitive and ethical challenges far beyond the elementary presidential chores Trump has already botched. Doomsday statecraft and battlefield clashes are hellishly difficult to control even for a president, like the elder Bush, who spent decades assiduously preparing for the job. Facing potentially catastrophic confrontations with China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, Trump doesn’t know how much he doesn’t know about the unknown unknowns. If you can’t stand to imagine him at war, this book shows why the reality could be a lot worse.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/lawrence-freedman-the-future-of-war.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '11 New Books We Recommend This Week', 'text': ' Two old friends debate the issues that accompany aging; an old friend of thriller readers (Jack Reacher) shows a softer side; a new story about Humpty Dumpty gets told with a twist.

John WilliamsDaily Books Editor and Staff Writer AGING THOUGHTFULLY: Conversations About Retirement, Romance, Wrinkles, & Regret, by Martha C. Nussbaum and Saul Levmore. (Oxford, $24.95.) This book is framed as a conversation between the law professor Saul Levmore and the philosopher Martha C. Nussbaum, colleagues at the University of Chicago. They debate mandatory retirement ages, cosmetic surgery and other subjects. \"Nussbaum and Levmore are as interested in asking the right questions as they are with notching the right answers,\" our critic Dwight Garner writes. KEEPING ON KEEPING ON, by Alan Bennett. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $40.) Life’s small dramas, unappeasable longings and sorrows, and political outrage are all on display in this collection of diaries by Bennett, the British playwright of stage-to-screen hits like \"The History Boys\" and \"The Lady in the Van.\" \"His book is a string of wry asides to the audience — pensées, jokes and anecdotes with the compression and tang of a Lydia Davis short story,\" our critic Parul Sehgal writes. THE MIDNIGHT LINE: A Jack Reacher Novel, by Lee Child. (Delacorte Press, $28.99.) A more compassionate Jack Reacher emerges in Lee Child’s latest novel about the lonely drifter with knuckles the size of walnuts. The plot is driven by Reacher’s desire to learn how a West Point class ring ended up in a pawnshop. The novel \"adds its share of classic moments to the Reacher canon,\" our reviewer Janet Maslin writes, and \"the last chapters have more emotional heft than anything Child has written before.\" MY LAI: Vietnam, 1968, and the Descent Into Darkness, by Howard Jones. (Oxford, $34.95.) This book about the famous massacre of Vietnamese villagers by American soldiers may be difficult to read — but it is essential for understanding our recent history. \"It is a book at once painful and useful,\" our reviewer Thomas E. Ricks writes, \"and is likely to become the standard reference work\" on the subject. BIRDCAGE WALK, by Helen Dunmore. (Atlantic Monthly, $26.) In her radiantly charged final novel, Dunmore (who died of cancer in June) imagines the turbulent life of an 18th-century British woman, a political activist at the time of the French Revolution, and the effect her radicalism has on her daughter’s troubled marriage to an imposing real estate developer. KISS ME SOMEONE, by Karen Shepard. (Tin House, $19.95.) A sharp-edged short story collection that vividly demonstrates how a woman can be another woman’s worst enemy. \"They’d always walked the line between teasing and cruelty,\" Shepard writes of four bridesmaids, nominally friends, in one story. A MOONLESS, STARLESS SKY: Ordinary Women and Men Fighting Extremism in Africa, by Alexis Okeowo. (Hachette, $26.) A Nigerian-American journalist profiles ordinary Africans living in defiance of the continent’s extremist movements, dramatically at times but more often through simple daily endurance. AFTER THE FALL, by Dan Santat. (Roaring Brook, $17.99; ages 4 to 8.) What if Humpty Dumpty (here decked out in jeans and a skinny tie) decided to pull himself together and get back up on that wall? Santat’s picture book explores that premise in a delightful tribute to resiliency and facing fears, with a stellar surprise ending. THE STARS BENEATH OUR FEET, by David Barclay Moore. (Knopf, $16.99; ages 8 to 12.) In this debut novel celebrating community and the power of imagination, a 12-year-old boy in the Harlem projects, still grieving his brother’s recent death, finds answers to his life’s questions by competing to build cities with Lego. TUMBLE & BLUE, by Cassie Beasley. (Dial, $17.99; ages 8 to 12.) A generations-old family curse and a mystical swamp-dwelling alligator are at the center of Beasley’s second fantasy novel, featuring a warmhearted exploration of fate. GOOD NIGHT, PLANET, by Liniers. (TOON Books, $12.95; ages 4 to 8.) The latest picture book from the Argentine cartoonist Liniers is a lively tale of a stuffed rabbit who, once his little girl falls asleep, promptly heads out for an adventure of his own.

Reviewing the book in The Times of London, Will Hodgkinson noted that Iron Maiden’s hits \"are essentially pop songs, albeit ones with squealing guitars and vocals from a man who sounded as if his testicles were snagged on a fence.\" That would be Dickinson, whom Hodgkinson goes on to describe in more detail: \"An everyman in Spandex who was at once relatable and fantastical, he perfected a howl of glory while sporting the look of a codpieced medieval knight on a trip to the disco. Stardom was inevitable.\" Dickinson probably wouldn’t mind the knight comparison. \"On one occasion,\" he writes, discussing his love of swordplay, \"I ended up fencing outdoors at the Renaissance Faire in California, amidst a crowd of pointy-hatted wenches and stout gentlemen wearing Elizabethan dress shouting ‘prithee’ in a Californian twang in 100-degree heat. After I cleaned the cow dung off my kit I was presented with a rosette that read ‘For valor.’\" If Dickinson’s sundry interests make him seem like an overcaffeinated gerbil with A.D.H.D., they may also have helped him cope with a certain ambivalence toward his primary career. \"I can’t listen to hours of continuous heavy metal,\" he told The Los Angeles Times in 1987, during the band’s heyday. \"It’s O.K. for a while, but then it causes your brain to explode. I want to listen to something else after a while.\" TOUCHÉ: Dickinson isn’t the only one with a thing for fencing.

AMERICA THE ANXIOUS: Why Our Search for Happiness Is Driving Us Crazy and How to Find It for Real, by Ruth Whippman. (St. Martin’s, $15.99.) Moving to the United States from Britain, Whippman notes an unsettling paradox: In a nation obsessed with contentment, why are so many miserable? Her catalog includes social media, parenting approaches and even a \"happiness city\" in Nevada with high suicide rates. PACHINKO, by Min Jin Lee. (Grand Central, $15.99.) Lee’s novel chronicles decades of a Korean family’s travails in Japan. After becoming pregnant by a married mobster in Korea,, 16-year-old Sunja leaves for a Korean neighborhood of Osaka; her departure sets off a multigenerational saga in which — as our reviewer, Krys Lee, put it — \"what is gained is a compassionate, clear gaze at the chaotic landscape of life itself.\" BUILDING ART: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry, by Paul Goldberger. (Vintage, $20.) Goldberger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic, explores the life and influences of Gehry. Born to a Jewish family in Canada, Gehry and his parents arrived in Los Angeles when he was 18. Goldberger focuses less on evaluating Gehry’s work than examining the factors that shaped it: the anti-Semitism of the mid-1900s; what lured Gehry to practice architecture; his pursuit of power and fame; and his rapid ascent. THE FALL GUY, by James Lasdun. (Norton, $15.95.) Charlie invites his cousin, Matthew, to his upstate New York home for the summer, where tensions brew between the men and Charlie’s wife. \"There’s something reptilian in Lasdun’s gaze, a coldblooded interest in furtiveness, in the lithe selfishness of the genteel,\" Charles Finch wrote here. \"This is exactly what a literary thriller should be: intelligent, careful, swift, unsettling.\" WHEN IN FRENCH: Love in a Second Language, by Lauren Collins. (Penguin, $17.) Collins, a staff writer for The New Yorker, reflects on the estrangements and intimacies that come with living abroad and falling in love with a Frenchman.

Paper, $15.99. Sims — the author of the novel \"A Questionable Shape\" — doesn’t hesitate to use his rich and borderline arcane vocabulary in this debut story collection, which moves readers from one beleaguered mind to another by way of nearly hysterical examination. From the first story, \"House-Sitting,\" in which a young man becomes plagued by the same nightmares he imagines must once have plagued the cabin’s owner, to the last, in which a film professor who has been denied tenure watches in horror as his nemesis delivers a well-received lecture on Hitchcock, Sims delves into the unhinged, the unnerved and the merely unwell. \"Your mind is racing,\" the house-sitter thinks. \"At the etymological level, your mind cannot stop cataloging all the terms that the vocabularies of architecture and psychology share. Entrance, for example. For while entrance is a psychological verb, referring to the process of hypnosis, it is also, at the same time, an architectural noun, referring to a point of ingress. To be entranced, psychologically, is to be pushed through the entrance of an alien thought structure. Hypnotized, you stand inside a new structure of thoughts, one that has been designed especially to encage you.\" Some readers may become frustrated by the author’s verbal pinwheels and conclude that his exacting, relentless explorations into the minds of his characters sacrifice content for style. But anyone who admires such pyrotechnics of language will find 21st-century echoes of Edgar Allan Poe in Sims’s portraits of paranoia and delusion, with their zodiacal narrowing and the maddening tungsten spin of their narratives. DEAD GIRLS And Other Stories By Emily Geminder 176 pp. Dzanc. Paper, $16.95. The girls of Geminder’s title may be dead, but her debut collection brims with life. Whether she’s writing, in the first story, about a displaced young girl at odds with her family and herself and this world or, in the last, about a young woman seeking meaning through her interactions with a corpse named Gracie (to which she’s assigned at a four-day anatomy workshop), Geminder demands attention through her prose. The worlds her characters inhabit are chaotic, disorienting, nightmarish and vital. When the middle school girl who narrates the first story meets an older boy her family will hate, she tells us he \"just slipped through some rip in the universe\" and has \"green cauldron eyes. … When he leans in toward me behind the gas station, somehow I know it’s him: the one who’ll save me.\" If it’s true that good art is often in conversation with the good art that preceded it, then Geminder’s stories seem to be in conversation with Aimee Bender’s work — the collection’s second story, \"1-800-FAT-GIRL,\" especially calls to mind Bender’s \"Debbieland,\" from the book \"Willful Creatures\" — as well as the work of master storytellers like Steven Millhauser and John L’Heureux. In short, this is a breathlessly fast-moving collection that leaves a reader enchanted, provoked and curious about the little-noticed corners of the darkening world. CATAPULT Stories By Emily Fridlund 199 pp. Sarabande. Paper, $16.95. Fridlund has had an impressive 2017: Her debut novel, \"History of Wolves,\" published in January, was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize, and now here comes a powerhouse of a first story collection notable for its temerity and its skilled combination of humor and insight. Awarded the Mary McCarthy Prize in Short Fiction by Ben Marcus (who praised its \"piercing\" wisdom and \"destabilizing insight\"), this is — seriously — a laugh-out-loud collection as wise as it is funny. Take this line from the final story: \"I think a teenage daughter must be like one of those lawn ornaments everybody has, one of those grotesque little gnomes that are so useless and absurd you don’t even need to look at them.\" It’s a funny image, made funnier by the fact that the speaker is herself a teenage daughter. Or this passage from the title story, delivered by a young girl who is too smart, too perceptive, too already bored with the world for her own good, as she renounces a former set of playmates: \"When we were 11, 12, I’d taken care of them all. Summer evenings, I used to usher them into the woods to play in the stand of old pine behind our houses. … I’d taken their shoes from them, and I’d taken their socks. I’d made their wimpy girl fantasies into categorical facts. … Look, the club-footed horse thief made you lame so you’d have to love him. Limp, limp. … There were only believers and doubters: I saw no other distinctions, considered none of them friends. You either believed what the mind could do — and took your severed horse hoof and found what solace there was — or you didn’t, and were a kid. I had no patience for pretenders, for people who needed shoes or snacks. I converted them all.\" THE AGE OF PERPETUAL LIGHT Stories By Josh Weil 258 pp. Grove. $25. \"No Flies, No Folly,\" the opening story of Weil’s brilliant new collection, reads like a microcosm for the book itself. The story traces the character development, over a number of years, of a peddler in Pennsylvania around the turn of the 20th century, an era of epic change, and his devotion to a large married Amish woman who is herself devoted to the Edison lamp. With its tightly woven and comprehensive scope, the story is a fitting introduction to the collection as a whole, which spans an entire century before pushing into an overlit future of wonderment. From story to story we are introduced to details so fine and clean that their observations are at once accessible and overwhelming for their acumen. \"The Age of Perpetual Light\" is a long collection, thanks partly to the fact that Weil seems most comfortable writing Deborah Eisenberg-length stories of 25 to 50-plus pages that can read more as novellas, in the best way possible. They are patient and provocative, nuanced and far-reaching. For their breadth, intensity and audacity of ambition, the stories of \"The Age of Perpetual Light\" situate themselves as natural heirs to such masterpieces as Denis Johnson’s \"Train Dreams\" and James Joyce’s \"The Dead.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/books/review/four-new-story-collections.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Day in the Life of Tina Brown', 'text': ' I’ve always kept a diary — I started when I was 10 and no one’s read it except for me — but, as time has gone by, just much more sporadically.

A much smaller portion of the audience in the South — mostly those living in Florida — will see Jacksonville at Cleveland. And then there is the pocket of TV viewers in Mississippi who will be shown Kansas City at the Giants. The Giants are a very bad team, and the Chiefs are not exactly Mississippi’s team. So what’s the explanation? On each Sunday during the football season, CBS and Fox broadcast several football games simultaneously, but send only one to your home. The process by which the networks decide which game you will see is called regionalization. At CBS, the executives Rob Correa and Kelly Wood, along with a team of researchers and staff members, decide which one. Each week, they prepare a preliminary schedule for three weekends out, a tentative schedule for two weekends out and a final schedule for one weekend out. \"We never know what week it is,\" Correa said. \"We literally come in on Sunday and go, ‘What week is it?’ \" There are compelling — and often contradictory — justifications for placing certain games with each of the 200-plus CBS affiliates, but generally it comes down to predicting which game will draw the biggest rating. Strategy, Correa dismissed, is \"a fancy word for picking the best games.\" But Correa and Wood can’t put the games just anywhere. There are myriad N.F.L. rules, broadcast restrictions and requests from local CBS affiliates influencing the process. They must consider esoteric sports-broadcast issues like home blackouts, flexing, cross flexing, prime flexing, constants, mandatory pullouts, primary markets, secondary markets and protected games. In other words, it’s not as easy as, \"Hey, everybody either really hates or really loves the Patriots, so let’s just put that game on everywhere.\" Here is how CBS went about regionalization for Week 11. Week 11 is a doubleheader week for CBS, meaning it is showing games in both an early window (1 p.m., Eastern time) and a late window (4:25 p.m.). CBS and Fox have nine doubleheader weeks and eight singleheader weeks apiece throughout the season. When a network has a doubleheader the other network has a singleheader; the exception is Week 17, when they both have doubleheaders. CBS generally broadcasts the American Football Conference, while Fox broadcasts the National Football Conference. When there are interconference matchups, like the Chiefs versus the Giants, the conference of the road team determines which network gets the broadcast. But some matchups are \"cross-flexed\" onto networks they wouldn’t normally be on. In Week 11, this means the Buffalo at Los Angeles Chargers game — between two A.F.C. teams — is on Fox. Therefore, CBS has three games in the early window and two in the late window. Kansas City at the Giants is the early-window game with the widest footprint, going to about 45 percent of the country. This game will be seen widely in the New York and Kansas City areas, as well as in New England and the areas of Kansas City’s A.F.C. West rivals. The game’s reach across the Mid-Atlantic will be constrained because Baltimore is playing at the same time. And what about that portion of Mississippi that will be served Chiefs-Giants? Giants quarterback Eli Manning starred at the University of Mississippi, and CBS believes that a lot of people in the state still want to watch him play. Individual players are usually not important enough to dictate where a broadcast goes, but there are a few exceptions — mostly quarterbacks who are from, or who attended college in, places other than major metropolitan areas. Besides Manning, Carson Wentz (North Dakota State), Deshaun Watson (Clemson), Teddy Bridgewater (Louisville) and Marcus Mariota (born in Hawaii) are among the players who might influence a broadcast decision. \"J.J. Watt, as unbelievable of a player he is, is not changing our map,\" Correa said. (Watt, who plays for the Houston Texans, is from Wisconsin and was a standout at the University of Wisconsin.) Five cities, comprising about 9 percent of the country’s population, will not get any N.F.L. game at all on CBS at 1 p.m.: Minneapolis, Chicago, Houston, New Orleans and Miami. The N.F.L. long maintained strict blackout rules to compel fans to fill stadiums; until 2014, games that were not sold out were not broadcast at all in their home markets. But those rules have all but withered away. The last important rule remaining is that no N.F.L. game can be broadcast opposite a home team in its primary market. At 1 p.m. Sunday, the Vikings, the Bears, the Texans, the Saints and the Dolphins are all playing at home — those games will be broadcast on Fox — so CBS cannot broadcast a game in those areas. Similarly, Fox will not be broadcasting games in New York, Green Bay or Cleveland. In the late window, 4:25 p.m., Eastern time, about 86 percent of the country will watch New England play Oakland in Mexico City. But the timing of when CBS flips from the early to the late game, or whether it flexes out of the game because it’s a blowout, depends on where you live. Oakland and most of Northern California, as well as Boston and some of New England, are designated mandatory pullout markets. Even if the early game runs long, even if it is the greatest game in N.F.L. history, these markets will be pulled out to see the New England at Oakland kickoff. Only a small percentage of markets are designated mandatory pullouts. \"You don’t want to be pulling people out of a game; it could be a great game,\" Wood said. On the flip side are the constant markets. By N.F.L. rules, if a team has an 18-point lead or greater in the third quarter, CBS can switch viewers to a different, more competitive game. But some markets — mostly those that were mandatory pullouts, plus a few others — are constants, meaning CBS will not switch them away from the game in progress. Twelve days before a given Sunday’s games, CBS sends out tentative game assignments to its affiliates. A small number of affiliates usually respond with requests — to receive a different game or to have their constant or mandatory pullout status changed. CBS accedes to most of these requests. Six days before a given Sunday’s games, CBS sends out final game assignments. It makes changes based on affiliate requests, as well as any major developments in Sunday’s games. A game’s footprint may decrease after a star is injured, for example, or increase after two teams score upset victories and enter the playoff picture. Week 11’s final assignments look quite similar to the preliminary assignments. Eight game assignments were changed in the 1 p.m. window, all because of affiliate requests. Seven affiliates dumped the Baltimore at Green Bay matchup, mostly switching to the Kansas City at Giants game. Thirty-six hours before the games, nothing will change. Well, unless … \"Unless a game moves, nothing is going to change,\" Wood said. \"Which has happened,\" Correa interjected. \"Hurricanes or snowstorms. Remember the one in Philly, where they got like two inches of snow? \"You remember all this crazy stuff.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/sports/football/why-people-in-mississippi-have-to-watch-the-giants.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Big N.F.L. Game Comes to Mexico City. These Guys Have it Covered.', 'text': ' MEXICO CITY — To wink at the New Orleans Saints’ rise, they bellowed \"When the Saints Go Marching In,\" doing their best, if slightly accented, Louis Armstrong impersonation. Half-arguing, like fans at a bar, they assessed the best football coaches of all time, pointedly leaving out one visiting here this weekend: Bill Belichick. And, even thousands of miles south of the United States border, the lowly Los Angeles Chargers could not escape some lumps for failing to fill their small, temporary and noticeably empty stadium. \"Nuestros amigos del podcast podrían llenar ese estadio,\" joked Ulises Harada. (\"Our podcast friends could fill that stadium.\") Maybe he wasn’t kidding. Harada is a host and founder of Primero y Diez, or First and 10, a collection of morning zoo-style podcasts, filled with songs and zany sound effects, about all things N.F.L. Its online programs, cousins of the Men in Blazers mode of coverage, are some of the most popular in Mexico, reflecting an unabashed devotion to the sport that has helped persuade the league to stage and promote games here. Primero y Diez began as a blog in 2008, run by Harada and a friend, and has mushroomed into four podcasts, with a paid staff of 12 and, it says, 1.5 million visits to its programs monthly during the football season. Primero y Diez has grown in sync with Mexican interest in the N.F.L., accelerated by the regular-season game here last season — the first in Mexico City in 11 years — and by a matchup Sunday between the New England Patriots and Oakland Raiders at the city’s famed Estadio Azteca, with another game planned for next year. Mexico’s proximity to the United States and a developing middle class fluent in American culture, not to mention innumerable cross-border ties, make it a market with unfulfilled potential for American sports leagues. The N.B.A., too, has a serious eye on Mexico, with two regular-season games to be played here in December and its commissioner, Adam Silver, professing interest in adding a franchise in Mexico City. Formula One, for the third year, staged a prominent race here in October, and Major League Baseball has plans to hold a three-game series between the San Diego Padres and the Los Angeles Dodgers in May in Monterrey, the first regular-season games in Mexico in 19 years. The leagues are finding that these big events carry a cachet that Mexicans, regardless of their level of interest in the sport, are willing to pay for. \"There is a social effect, and one of not wanting to miss the big event in the city,\" said Rodrigo Latorre, an independent sports marketing analyst. \"In that regard, a lot of attendance is guaranteed.\" Both N.F.L. games, in a stadium with a capacity of 72,000 for American football, sold out in less than an hour. The average price was $95. On Primero y Diez programs, the complicated discussions and debate that occur in the United States — over concussions, domestic violence, racial protests by players and whether the sport is in decline — take a back seat to full-throated dissections of Philip Rivers’s floating passes, and Blake Bortles’s interceptions, and whether the Rams \"can play with the big boys of the N.F.C.\" \"Here in Mexico they like sports, but they don’t like to talk about what surrounds sports,\" said Harada, 32, who worked in public relations and sports journalism before beginning the site to satisfy his own demand for saturated N.F.L. news and commentary. When the site shut down for a week in September, out of respect for the 370 people killed in and around Mexico City by an earthquake , a wave of complaints came in. \"People were looking for information to place their bets,\" said Andres Ornelas, 34, who does a betting podcast for the site. \"They said it’s how they pay their rent.\" A loose vibe prevails in the cramped, rented booth where the podcasts are recorded. A cardboard cutout of Raiders quarterback Derek Carr loomed over the hosts last week, and during one taping they sipped cold beer while riffing on the weekend’s games. \"There is great quality in their content with a lot of different elements that give great, additional value,\" said Eric Arriaga, a 34-year-old government lawyer who follows the podcasts. \"All their work is unique and original.\" Though overshadowed by the more widespread, rabid following of soccer, American football has long been popular here, with youth leagues (some of them financed by the N.F.L.), high school and college programs and fledgling professional teams. The N.F.L. is betting on a future of long-term economic growth in Mexico to expand the middle class and lure more sponsors; further develop a growing fan base (the league’s surveys put it at upward of 10 million self-described hard-core fans); and increase sales of merchandise, as well as television and media rights. In a typical week, nine games are aired in Mexico City, two on broadcast television and the others on cable — in some cases more than what is available in most American cities. As in the United States, ratings have slipped \"in the single digits,\" said Arturo Olive, the N.F.L.’s point person in Mexico. Some of that loss, he said, has been made up through the growing popularity of the league’s Game Pass service, which allows viewers to stream any game, and Olive predicted that the N.F.L. and Televisa, the Mexican broadcasting powerhouse that carries the regular-season games, would renew their contract when it comes up in 2020. Most analysts believe that security and logistical hurdles make putting a permanent team here largely a fantasy. The city’s smog and elevation of about 7,500 feet are enough of a challenge that extra oxygen tanks will be on hand for the players this weekend. But the league reaps benefits in business deals around the visits. Olive said the game on Sunday would turn a profit for the league, but he declined to elaborate. \"At the very least, the underlying long-run effect of the N.F.L.’s traveling expansion-relocation gambit is ultimately to widen the league’s worldwide media footprint,\" said John Vrooman, a Vanderbilt University economist who has studied the league’s strategy. The N.F.L. decided to resume regular-season games here after Estadio Azteca, a showcase venue for soccer, was remodeled last year for its 50th anniversary, adding two locker rooms suitable for professional football teams and internet and communications upgrades expressly to lure back the N.F.L. The Patriots and the Raiders are two of the most popular teams in Mexico. The Cowboys and the Steelers lead the pack, since their games were the first to be broadcast in the country in the 1970s. When fans are encountered here, they tend to be rabid about the sport. \"What I would tell you is the level of knowledge that fans have of the game, the Xs and Os, the sophistication, is as strong as it is in the U.S.,\" said Mark Waller, the N.F.L.’s chief international executive. \"When you become the fan of a sport in another country, almost by definition you become more knowledgeable because you have to force yourself to learn it.\" The young men behind Primero y Diez exemplify that. Their site is housed in an incubator for tech start-ups in a hip neighborhood, buzzing with well-educated 20- and 30-somethings like themselves. Jorge Tinajero, 41, a computer engineer who is another founder of the site, traces his passion for the sport to a family tradition of football, in his case a father who played at a college in Mexico. Tinajero played touch football as a boy and remembers getting hooked for good while watching John Elway in the Super Bowl against the Giants. \"And then I started suffering every two or three years like die-hard Broncos fans,\" he said. Carlos Gorozpe, 31, a social network and website consultant and a commentator on Primero y Diez, said he had never caught the soccer bug, instead inheriting a fondness for the Buffalo Bills from an uncle mad about the team and about college football here and in the United States. \"As a kid, I woke up to watch bowl games,\" he said. Primero y Diez receives news media credentials from the N.F.L. — and Harada writes occasional pieces in Spanish for the Steelers’ website — but it otherwise is not affiliated with the league, which Harada said he preferred. \"I like the idea of independence, I have so many ideas,\" he said. This week, Primero y Diez has been in its element. It has published a magazine on the Patriots-Raiders game, filled with statistical breakdowns, player snapshots, a history of the stadium. And it was planning live shows on Facebook in the days leading up to the game. \"I don’t see the Raiders winning this game, but … \" Gorozpe said during a recording session, setting up an argument about the strengths and weaknesses of the teams. The debate litigated, among other points, whether the Raiders’ having played here last year (in a 27-20 win over the Houston Texans) was a bonus or the Patriots’ general dominance and their altitude training in Colorado this week would give them an edge. \"I don’t know what the Raiders are going to do to deter the offense of the Patriots,\" Tinajero said. Harada settled on a prediction: Raiders over the Patriots, 31-28. It surely did not come out of thin air.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/sports/football/mexico-patriots-raiders.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Before Thanksgiving Week Showdown, Alabama and Auburn Order Cupcakes', 'text': ' Charleston Southern. Georgia Southern. Georgia State. Western Carolina, twice. Chattanooga, three times. This is the murderers’ row that Alabama’s football team had faced, at home, in the penultimate weekend of each regular season since 2009. All played at the time in the lower-tier Football Championship Subdivision. On Saturday, the No. 1 Crimson Tide (11-0) routed Mercer — another F.C.S. team, which stood about as much chance of winning in Tuscaloosa as Bear Bryant did of coming back to life and reassuming his coaching duties. In addition to serving a purpose for each side — so-called guarantee games typically involve a payment to the visiting team and a lucrative seventh home game for the host — for Alabama, the timing of this game often makes it function as a light workout near the end of a grueling regular season. \"It’s an important game to us for a lot of reasons,\" Alabama Coach Nick Saban said on Wednesday, adding, \"we have some new guys playing — it’s really good for them to develop confidence and experience.\" The game also involves preparation for what comes next: the Iron Bowl, Alabama’s annual in-state rivalry game against Auburn, which lately has been something like college football’s preplayoff Super Bowl. In five of the eight completed seasons since 2009, the winner of the Iron Bowl has gone on to win the national championship. The victor has qualified for the national postseason every single year. With No. 6 Auburn (9-2) having recently walloped No. 7 Georgia — the team the Iron Bowl’s winner will face in the Southeastern Conference title game on Dec. 2 — this year’s big game, which will take place at Auburn next Saturday, is another high-stakes affair. To prepare for it, Auburn does much the same thing as Alabama. Its most recent pre-Iron Bowl opponents have been Alabama A&M (twice), Samford (twice), Chattanooga, Furman, Idaho and, on Saturday, Louisiana-Monroe, a 42-14 loser. Idaho and Louisiana-Monroe are at least in lower-tier conferences of Alabama and Auburn’s own Football Bowl Subdivision. (Auburn has already played an F.C.S. opponent at home, beating none other than Mercer, 24-10, in September.) Schedules like Alabama’s and Auburn’s tend to prompt the talk-radio charge that records inflated by such walk-in-the-park victories lead to artificially puffed-up playoff résumés, particularly when the easy opponents come so late in the season. One website called the SEC’s status as the Power 5 league that plays the most F.C.S. opponents an \"ignominious distinction.\" \"Cupcakes and home cooking,\" an ESPN writer sniffed of such matchups in 2015, and a website that covers Colorado football once referred to this kind of slate as the \"SEC’s siesta.\" Unlike the Big 12, the Big Ten and the Pacific-12, SEC teams play eight conference games per year instead of nine, and unlike the Big Ten, the SEC permits games against F.C.S. opponents. Many SEC teams take advantage of this flexibility, even if the games are less conspicuously clustered on this particular weekend than they used to be: 10 SEC teams were set to play conference opponents on Saturday. But amid cries of \"Overrated!\" it is important to note that a team’s easiest opponents do not much influence its overall body of work because, as advanced analytics show, playing slightly better teams — as all big-time teams do every season — is actually easier than it looks. \"The bigger impact on schedule strength that my numbers would indicate is how strong is the top half of your schedule,\" said Brian Fremeau, a college football analyst who contributes to Football Outsiders. That is, the biggest differences in strength of schedule in the competitively top-heavy sport of college football are not between the merely bad opponents and the worst ones, but between the very good and the best. For what Fremeau labels an \"elite\" team, a group that by his definition includes both Alabama and Auburn this season, the strength-of-schedule difference between playing a middling opponent from a lesser F.B.S. conference and a middling opponent from an F.C.S. conference is minimal. To use two examples: Fremeau had given Alabama \"effectively a 100 percent chance\" of defeating Mercer (5-6), though he does not formally analyze F.C.S. teams, and Auburn a 99.0 percent chance of defeating Louisiana-Monroe (4-6). That means that while F.C.S. opponents symbolically offer less of a fight, practically speaking, against elite teams, they may as well be in the Sun Belt or the Mountain West. \"It’s a quirk,\" Fremeau said. \"F.C.S. scheduling certainly has an impact, but not as big as the top end.\" By contrast, the difference for elite teams between playing other elite teams and playing merely very good teams is vast. A generic elite team playing Auburn at Auburn — as Alabama will do next Saturday — would have just a 36 percent chance of prevailing, according to Fremeau’s numbers entering this weekend. The same elite team playing on the road against Iowa, which Fremeau’s numbers esteem the 16th-best team, would have a 66 percent chance of winning. That 30-point difference is magnitudes more meaningful than that between Mercer and Louisiana-Monroe. Intuitively, this makes sense: While it is true that lower-tier teams beat ones from the Power 5 conferences every season — and, as every Michigan fan from 2007 knows, even F.C.S. teams occasionally beat the blue bloods — very rarely do such squads topple the best teams. \"You are really playing a game in which an elite team is in real danger of losing against that top 10, 15, 20,\" Fremeau said. \"Anything beyond that, and elite teams generally clean up. That’s why they’re elite teams.\" All of which is to say that when Auburn and Alabama meet next week, their victories over much easier opponents ought not to be cited as evidence that they are not as good as the Associated Press poll, the College Football Playoff selection committee or their records make them out to be. One person who would like to see this matter further cleared up is Saban. While his team takes advantage of the rules as written, he has long advocated that Power 5 teams play only other Power 5 teams. \"Nobody wants to do that,\" he said. \"Everybody wants to get bowl-eligible. I get that.\" But tougher scheduling, he added, would be \"better for the fans and for everybody else.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/sports/ncaafootball/alabama-auburn-iron-bowl-sec.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'College Football: Oklahoma State’s Slim Playoff Hopes Wither', 'text': ' Byron Pringle caught three touchdown passes and returned a kickoff for a score, helping visiting Kansas State stun No. 10 Oklahoma State, 45-40, on Saturday. Oklahoma State nearly erased a 29-point deficit in the second half, but Kansas State held on to become bowl eligible for an eighth consecutive season. Pringle, a junior, caught four passes for a career-high 166 yards. His kickoff return touchdown covered 89 yards. He entered the game with eight career touchdowns, and he had never scored more than two in a game. The freshman Skylar Thompson threw for 204 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 93 yards and a score in his second start for the injured Jesse Ertz. Kansas State entered the game as a nearly three-touchdown underdog, something Coach Bill Snyder had discussed with his team. \"I can understand why that number was out there,\" he said. \"We all knew it wasn’t an accurate number, but I told them, ‘You’re going to have to go out there and prove it.’ And we proved it tonight.\" Oklahoma State’s Mason Rudolph passed for 425 yards and three touchdowns and ran for a score. James Washington caught eight passes for 159 yards and two touchdowns for the Cowboys, who are No. 13 in the College Football Playoff rankings. Rudolph threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Dillon Stoner, cutting Kansas State’s lead to 45-40 with just over four minutes to go. The Wildcats went three-and-out, giving Oklahoma State a chance to take the lead, but Rudolph missed four straight passes, and Kansas State ran out the clock. It was Oklahoma State’s third home loss, and it crushed the Cowboys’ already slim chances of reaching the playoff. Mike Gundy, the Cowboys’ coach, said, \"We all need to look at ourselves and figure out what’s going on, because for whatever reason, we’re not showing up.\" Brandon Wimbush threw for 164 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a score as Notre Dame rallied in the rain and wind to beat visiting Navy. Wearing throwback uniforms with the name Rockne on the back of each player’s jersey and helmets designed to evoke the leather tops from the era of Knute Rockne, one of the Irish’s most famous names, Notre Dame, No. 8 in the playoff rankings, kept its slim national championship hopes alive heading into its regular-season finale next Saturday at Stanford. Wimbush, who threw two interceptions and lost a fumble in Notre Dame’s 41-8 loss at Miami two Saturdays ago, connected with Kevin Stepherson twice and added his 14th rushing touchdown of the year as the Irish scored on three straight possessions late in the game, part of the longest-running matchup between teams from different regions of the country, dating to 1927. Alex Hornibrook’s 24-yard touchdown pass to A. J. Taylor in the third quarter broke open a defensive slugfest, Kendric Pryor scored on an end-around, and Wisconsin remained undefeated with a victory at home over Michigan. The Badgers, No. 5 in the playoff rankings, padded their playoff résumé in a grinding, physical matchup against the Wolverines, who are No. 24 in the playoff rankings. Hornibrook completed 9 of 19 passes for 143 yards and bounced back from an interception early in the third quarter with some of his best throws of the season. He connected with Taylor through a tight window in the end zone for a 14-10 lead with about three and a half minutes left in the third quarter. Malik Rosier threw three touchdown passes and ran for a score, and Miami pulled off its biggest comeback in five years, holding off visiting Virginia and extending its winning streak, the longest in the Football Bowl Subdivision, to 15 games. Jaquan Johnson returned an interception for a touchdown, and Miami went on a 30-0 run in the second half as it remained unbeaten. The Hurricanes, No. 3 in the playoff rankings, erased two 14-point deficits. They had lost 15 consecutive games in which they trailed at any point by such a margin, but the defense made two fourth-down stops in Virginia territory in the fourth quarter, and the Hurricanes finished 7-0 at home in the regular season for the first time since 1988. Jalen Hurts passed for 180 yards and three touchdowns in a little more than a quarter, and Alabama beat visiting Mercer, a Football Championship Subdivision team. The Crimson Tide, who lead the playoff rankings, raced to a 35-0 halftime lead in what amounted to a tuneup for their biggest game. Alabama heads to Auburn for the Iron Bowl, with the winner facing Georgia in the Southeastern Conference championship game in Atlanta. Oklahoma’s Baker Mayfield threw for 257 yards and three touchdowns after being snubbed by the Kansas captains before kickoff, leading the visiting Sooners, who are fourth in the playoff rankings, to a rout of the Jayhawks. Mayfield had tried shaking hands with the Jayhawks captains Daniel Wise, Dorance Armstrong Jr. and Joe Dineen Jr. after the coin toss, but they stared stoically back at him. Mayfield quickly pulled his hand away, clapped a couple of times and set about burnishing his Heisman Trophy candidacy. He threw touchdown passes to Rodney Anderson and Marquise Brown in the first half and then found Mark Andrews late in the third quarter, which prompted more insults between Mayfield and the Jayhawks. Kelly Bryant threw for 230 yards and three touchdowns and left the game before halftime as Clemson remained comfortably in the playoff race with a victory at home over the Citadel. The lower-division Bulldogs were out of the game quickly. After Bryant’s 14-yard touchdown pass to T. J. Chase on the Tigers’ 26th play, Clemson, No. 2 in the playoff rankings, led by 28-0. Bryant completed 17 of 22 passes before Tigers Coach Dabo Swinney started putting in backups to work on the two-minute drill before the end of the first half. The freshman receiver Tee Higgins caught six passes for 178 yards and two touchdowns, and Travis Etienne, another freshman, ran eight times for 62 yards and two touchdowns. Clemson scored on nine of its first 10 possessions and ended the game with 662 yards, its third game of more than 600 yards this season. Darius Slayton’s 50-yard scoring catch late in the first half gave Auburn the lead, and the Tigers pulled away for a victory at home over Louisiana-Monroe before next week’s visit from Alabama. Kam Martin scored two touchdowns, one rushing and one receiving, in the third quarter. Nick Ruffin scored on a 45-yard interception return in the fourth. Auburn, No. 6 in the playoff rankings, can earn a spot in the Southeastern Conference championship game with a victory over Alabama next weekend. Nick Chubb and Sony Michel led a dominant running game, and host Georgia, No. 7 in the playoff rankings, bounced back from its first loss of the season, wearing down Kentucky. Chubb rushed for 151 yards and two touchdowns, including a 55-yard burst down the sideline to seal the victory early in the fourth quarter. Michel rambled for 87 yards and three scores of his own, most notably a 37-yard touchdown that sent the Bulldogs into the half with a 21-6 lead. Ohio State scored on its first six possessions, including J. T. Barrett’s 100th career touchdown pass, as the Buckeyes routed visiting Illinois and clinched the Big Ten East title. Barrett, playing in his final game at Ohio Stadium, threw for two touchdowns and ran for one more as the Buckeyes, No. 9 in the playoff rankings, dominated from the opening kick. Barrett became the Ohio State leader in rushing yards among quarterbacks (3,070), eclipsing Braxton Miller. He now holds 35 Big Ten and program records. Saquon Barkley broke Penn State’s career touchdown record with three scores and had 208 of his 224 total yards in the first half, leading the Nittany Lions over visiting Nebraska in the highest-scoring game in Beaver Stadium history. Barkley passed Lydell Mitchell for the record with his 39th touchdown. Trace McSorley ran for a touchdown and threw for 325 yards on 24-of-36 passing with three scoring passes for Penn State. The true freshman quarterback Shawn Robinson ran for 84 yards and threw a crucial second-half touchdown in his first career start as Texas Christian won at Texas Tech and stayed in contention for a spot in the Big 12 championship game. While Robinson completed only 6 of 17 passes for 85 yards, he made a 12-yard touchdown throw to Jalen Reagor late in the third quarter, giving the Horned Frogs, No. 12 in the playoff rankings, a 17-3 lead. McKenzie Milton threw four touchdown passes and ran for a score as Central Florida comfortably took care of business at Temple, remaining unbeaten as it heads into a showdown with its rival South Florida. The Knights, No. 15 in the playoff rankings, scored 17 points on three first-half turnovers by Temple inside its 25. They took a 31-10 lead when Gabriel Davis stretched across the goal line for a 5-yard touchdown reception with just over two and a half minutes left in the second quarter. ■ Kurt Rawlings threw for 177 yards and a touchdown to lead host Yale over its rival Harvard, 24-3, securing the Bulldogs’ first outright Ivy League championship in 37 years. Running backs Melvin Rouse and Zane Dudek combined for 106 yards rushing for Yale, which beat Harvard for a second straight season after previously losing nine in a row in the rivalry known as the Game. ■ Josh Wainwright had a career-high 13 catches for 127 yards and a touchdown, setting Columbia’s single-season record for receiving yards, and the Lions finished at 8-2 in one of the most successful seasons in program history with a 24-6 victory at home over Brown. ■ Richard Lagow threw two touchdown passes, and Morgan Ellison ran for two more scores as host Indiana shut out Rutgers, 41-0. ■ Trevor Moore kicked a 39-yard field goal with five seconds left, giving North Texas a wild 52-49 victory at home over Army, ending the Black Knights’ six-game winning streak. ■ Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson had another big game against visiting Syracuse, accounting for 381 yards and four touchdowns and becoming the Cardinals’ career yardage leader while leading a rain-delayed 56-10 rout. ■ Austin Longi and Chase Edmonds each broke free for long touchdowns late in the game as Fordham rallied past visiting Bucknell, 20-9, in a wet and windy Patriot League season-ender. ■ Ryan Fulse ran for 192 yards and three touchdowns, and Wagner defeated host Sacred Heart, 28-15, in a Northeast Conference season finale. ■ Tre Solomon scored on a 3-yard run with just over two minutes left to play, Jacob Martin broke up a pass on third-and-goal from the 1 on the final play, and Penn capped its season with its fourth win in a row, a 29-22 victory over visiting Cornell. ■ Jared Gerbino ran for a career-high 202 yards and four touchdowns, including the clinching score with no time left, as host Dartmouth beat Princeton, 54-44, in a regular-season closer for both teams.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/sports/college-football-oklahoma-state-michigan.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'N.F.L. Picks Week 11: Saints Over Redskins, Eagles Over Cowboys', 'text': ' If not for Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott’s suspension, a clash between Philadelphia and Dallas would have been the marquee matchup of N.F.L. Week 11. But Sunday now appears to have other games that should top it for excitement. The streaking Saints and Vikings will try to stay hot against quality teams, and the Patriots will try to maintain their defensive improvement. In games of lesser note, the Browns will keep searching for their first win, the Chiefs will try to stop a steep decline and the Bills, for some reason, will try out a new quarterback. Here are our picks against the spread. Last week’s record against the spread: 6-7-1 Overall record: 70-72-4 Redskins at Saints, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Saints by 7.5 The elements were all there last week for a big rushing day by the Saints (7-2). They had two quality running backs who were playing well, they were playing a team that has struggled to stop the run and they were playing outdoors in conditions more suited to running than passing. But even the most generous prognosticators could not have anticipated New Orleans reeling off 298 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns in one of the most dominant performances in N.F.L. history. The reliance on the running game — at one point, New Orleans ran on 24 consecutive offensive plays — was shocking to people who are used to Drew Brees carving up defenses with his passing. But while New Orleans still receives far-above-average performances from Brees, the team has relied more and more on the running game. A load-sharing strategy between Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara has the team on a pace for nearly 2,300 rushing yards and the two players in line to combine for more than 3,000 yards from scrimmage. This week, the Saints are not playing the Bills. The Redskins (4-5) will not make anyone forget the 2000 Baltimore Ravens, but they are middle of the pack in nearly every measurable form of run defense. So while Ingram and Kamara may still perform well, anyone expecting a repeat of last week is likely to be disappointed. Of course, the Saints still have the ageless Brees and are playing at home, and Washington is ranked in the bottom half of the N.F.L. in pass defense. So a team that is rising in leaguewide respect on offense and defense may put on just as good a show, even if it comes together in a different way. Pick: Saints Rams at Vikings, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Vikings by 2 The Vikings (7-2) are in quite a pickle. They have Teddy Bridgewater, the team’s preferred starting quarterback, healthy and ready to play, but Case Keenum, a journeyman backup, has led the team to five consecutive wins — four as a starter and one in relief of Sam Bradford. And it is not as if Keenum has just been along for the ride; he has played the best football of his career. For now, the job belongs to Keenum. But he and the Vikings have a tough task against Keenum’s former team, the surging Rams (7-2). Keenum’s replacement in Los Angeles, Jared Goff, has led the way for the N.F.L.’s top-scoring offense (32.9 points a game), and thanks to some refinement by the defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Rams also have the league’s third best scoring defense (18 points a game). No one would have guessed it before the season started, but this is absolutely a matchup of two of the five or six best teams in the N.F.L., and whichever team comes out on top will have bragging rights for weeks. Pick: Vikings Eagles at Cowboys, 8:30 p.m., NBC Line: Eagles by 3.5 The timing could not be worse for the Cowboys (5-4) to be hosting the Eagles (8-1). In last week’s debut of the Ezekiel Elliott-free version of Dallas’s offense, Dak Prescott was decidedly mortal, producing 176 passing yards on 5.87 yards an attempt (the fifth lowest mark of his career). Losing Elliott to a six-game suspension meant not only a major downgrade in the running game, but also the elimination of the star running back as a threat on play-action passes. Knowing that Dallas would be passing, Atlanta went hard after Prescott on every play, and feasted with eight sacks. Now Dallas will be dealing with a Philadelphia defense led by Fletcher Cox that is infinitely more terrifying than Atlanta’s, while Dallas’s defense, which had shown some improvement, will be stuck trying to slow down Carson Wentz and the Eagles’ offense. It looks like Dallas is headed back to .500. Pick: Eagles Patriots at Raiders, 4:25 p.m., CBS Line: Patriots by 6.5 It is hard to complain about a 41-16 victory, but the Patriots (7-2) allowed enough yardage last week against a Denver offense led by Brock Osweiler for it to qualify as troubling. The good news is that New England has picked a fantastic season to work through some issues, as the A.F.C. has been awful. There is a chance that Derek Carr could regain some of his mojo from last season, which would put a ton of pressure on New England’s secondary, but the Raiders (4-5) just don’t seem to have the right pieces to succeed. Pick: Patriots Titans at Steelers, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), NBC and NFL Network Line: Steelers by 7 An emphasis on these teams coming in with matching four-game win streaks ignores the fact that they were playing mostly bad teams and neither managed to dominate the competition. It is not that wins against teams like the Colts, Bengals and Browns don’t count in the standings, but it is hard to extrapolate too much from lopsided matchups. There is no question that the Titans (6-3) have shown improvement, and they should continue to do so against the Steelers (7-2), who will be playing without Joe Haden, a veteran cornerback, who is out with a fractured fibula. Pick: Titans Ravens at Packers, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Ravens by 2 The Packers (5-4) not only won last week, but they also managed some legitimate moments of excitement on offense for the first time since Aaron Rodgers’s injury. Brett Hundley appeared far more confident and produced his best game as a pro. The win, however, should be taken with a grain of salt, as it came against Chicago. It will not be easy to repeat the success with Aaron Jones out and Ty Montgomery questionable, which could leave Green Bay with Jamaal Williams and Devante Mays at running back. But the Ravens (4-5) have been awful recently, with the exception of a fluky win over lowly Miami, so Hundley may get the Packers back to two games over .500, which seemed impossible two weeks ago. Pick: Packers Jaguars at Browns, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Jaguars by 7.5 The improvement of the run defense for the Jaguars (6-3) no longer seems like a fluke, and Jacksonville has somehow become the third best team in the A.F.C. If the team had a more consistent offense, it would be perfect, but in most weeks, the Jaguars have figured out a way, either through Blake Bortles or Leonard Fournette, to put up enough points to let the defense win the game for them. The Browns (0-9) have a tendency to bring their opponents down to their level, which probably means a fourth consecutive win for Jacksonville, but a failure to cover the large point spread. Pick: Browns Lions at Bears, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Lions by 3 The Lions (5-4) have won two games in a row, and according to The Upshot’s Playoff Simulator, they are up to a 33 percent chance of qualifying for postseason play. There is a chance Detroit is looking past this matchup to focus on Week 12’s division battle with Minnesota, but taking care of business in an extremely winnable road game against a struggling team like the Bears (3-6) is one of the little things a team has to do before it can be taken seriously. Pick: Lions Chiefs at Giants, 1 p.m., CBS Line: Chiefs by 10.5 The Chiefs (6-3) have lost three of their last four games, but what should really be troubling is the fact that Kareem Hunt, the team’s rookie running back, has been held to 47.8 rushing yards a game in that span after he averaged 121.8 yards in the first five games of his career. The Giants (1-8) are bad at everything, so a nice bounce-back week for Kansas City seems in order, with the only hitch being the unlikelihood of it covering a double-digit point spread. Pick: Giants Bills at Chargers, 4:05 p.m., Fox Line: Chargers by 4 The Bills (5-4) have not made the playoffs since 1999 and have managed a winning record in only two seasons since then. They are in line for the A.F.C.’s second wild-card entry into the playoffs, so most people would probably envision them doing everything they can to hold on to that spot. Instead, Buffalo’s response to a pair of losses caused almost entirely by failures of its run defense was to bench its starting quarterback. Out goes Tyrod Taylor and in goes Nathan Peterman, a rookie drafted in the fifth round out of Pittsburgh who has thrown 10 career passes (all last week). Unless Peterman plans to run onto the field to tackle Melvin Gordon and Austin Ekeler of the Chargers (3-6) as the two running backs repeatedly streak past Buffalo defenders, it is hard to see how this move will benefit the Bills. Pick: Chargers Bengals at Broncos, 4:25 p.m., CBS Line: Broncos by 2.5 The Broncos (3-6) are on a five-game losing streak, but the last three came against Kansas City, Philadelphia and New England. Sure, Denver looked bad, but most teams look bad against those powerhouses. The Bengals (3-6) are not nearly as scary, and the combination of a more palatable opponent and home-field advantage should get Denver its first win since Oct. 1. Pick: Broncos Cardinals at Texans, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Cardinals by 1 The Texans (3-6) have scored just two offensive touchdowns in the two weeks since Deshaun Watson was lost for the year. But they may have the better offense in this game if Drew Stanton of the Cardinals (4-5) is unable to play because of a knee injury. If there was ever a game not to televise, it would be Tom Savage against Blaine Gabbert. Pick: Texans Buccaneers at Dolphins, 1 p.m., Fox Line: Dolphins by 1 Fantasy football players may check in on this game to see if Kenyan Drake, Miami’s second-year running back, can break off another huge run, as he has in the last two weeks. Otherwise, it is hard to see how anyone could be excited to watch Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Buccaneers (3-6) take on the mostly lifeless Dolphins (4-5). Pick: Buccaneers Falcons at Seahawks, 8:30 p.m., ESPN Line: Seahawks by 3 Earl Thomas is expected to be back for the Seahawks (6-3) for the first time since Week 8. While he was out with a hamstring injury, Seattle lost Richard Sherman for the year to a ruptured Achilles’ tendon. The Legion of Boom will still be strong up the middle with Thomas and Kam Chancellor, but trying to defend Atlanta’s wide receivers with cornerbacks Shaq Griffin, Jeremy Lane and Justin Coleman seems unlikely, which could mean a second consecutive victory for the Falcons (5-4).

Gianluigi Buffon, denied his dream of a sixth World Cup, led the way, confirming with tears in his eyes that he would not play for his country again. Daniele De Rossi and Andrea Barzagli soon followed. Italy lost two World Cups on Monday night: first its chance of appearing in the 2018 edition, and then the three players who represented the final links to 2006, the last men standing from the generation that conquered the world. As Italy tried, on Tuesday, to digest the idea that it would not be present at a World Cup for the first time in 60 years, the country embarked on that journey that comes as an inevitable consequence of a sporting failure that has the air of a national humiliation. First, it sought people to blame, soon settling on two candidates: Gian Piero Ventura, the coach, and Carlo Tavecchio, president of the F.I.G.C., the country’s soccer federation. Tavecchio fired Ventura on Wednesday, but ignored growing calls that he resign. Then, as it absorbed the shock and its fury abated, Italy began to seek explanations. There is an instinct in these situations to call for what the newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport labeled a \"Year Zero,\" to assume that only seismic change can rectify a seismic shock, to demand that everything be ripped up and started again. The disappointment is too intense to be rooted in bad luck; it must, instead, be proof of some wide-ranging systemic failure. It is tempting to look at the consequence and reverse-engineer a cause. In the 24 hours following the loss, Italy did just that. The former Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi advised that \"we have to do many things differently from now on\" for the country to regain its prestige and its pedestal. Urbano Cairo, the president of Torino F.C., was busy calling for a \"complete restart.\" An editorial in Gazzetta dello Sport called for more money to be invested in youth academies and suggested a task force be dispatched to learn from the successes of Germany and, more recently, England in kick-starting the development of young players. It all fits so neatly. Italy is a country used to measuring the speed and scale of its own decline — in society as much as in sport — while the demise of Serie A, its top flight, is an article of faith across soccer. Not long ago, it was the most desirable and most admired club competition in the world. Now it languishes behind the Premier League, the Bundesliga and La Liga for glamour, interest and financial power. Its stadiums, with only a couple of exceptions, are rotting; it continues to struggle with the scourge of some of its clubs’ ultras. Its teams, Juventus apart, generally have little or no effect in continental competitions; many are over-reliant on aging players, their legs weary and powers dulled. It is Italy’s self-perception — of a country slowly, inexorably crumbling — made flesh, and played out every Saturday and Sunday. That logic, though, rather ignores the reality. Serie A is the most vibrant it has been in years, with arguably the most engaging championship race in any of Europe’s major leagues. Napoli, described by Manchester City Manager Pep Guardiola as one of the best teams he has ever faced, Roma and Internazionale all have the look of genuine challengers to Juventus’s hegemony. Serie A’s teams, meanwhile, have a younger average age than those of both the Premier League and La Liga, and the country’s young players are enjoying significantly more success than they have for some time: Its under-19 team finished as runners-up in last year’s European Championship and its under-20s were third in this year’s World Cup. Most remarkably, some of them are even being given a chance to play in Serie A, a league with a chronic distrust of youth. A core of young players — Gianluigi Donnarumma, Manuel Locatelli, Alessio Romagnoli, Patrick Cutrone — have enlivened A.C. Milan. Juventus can boast Daniele Rugani and Federico Bernardeschi; Lorenzo Pellegrini joined Roma this summer; in Pietro Pellegri, a 16-year-old striker, Genoa may be in possession of the country’s brightest talent; Atalanta, a team with a squad drawn in no small measure from its youth academy, qualified for a European competition for the first time in decades last season. Italian soccer has its problems, of course — stadiums, ultras and television rights, most pressingly — but it is in a healthier state now than, for example, when the country won the World Cup in 2006, in the aftermath of a match-fixing scandal. It has not failed to qualify for Russia because of some structural shortcoming or moral flaw, but for rather more prosaic reasons. First: Italy has failed to understand how FIFA’s ranking system, which decides which teams are seeded where in World Cup qualifying, works; or, more pertinently, its authorities have failed to understand how to make it work for them. Italy has a woeful record in meaningless friendly matches over the last five years. That has seen the national team, one of Europe’s superpowers, slide down those FIFA rankings, leaving it as a second seed when the qualifying draw was made. Italy was duly drawn with Spain, a top seed. Better results in friendlies — or, ironically, merely playing fewer friendlies — would have spared Italy such an intimidating opponent in its group, and might have averted the need for a playoff altogether. Second: When the F.I.G.C., which governs Italian soccer, sought a replacement for Antonio Conte last summer, it settled upon Ventura, the experienced but unremarkable coach of Torino. Ventura had no experience of international soccer, and little at the summit of Serie A. He was attractive because he seemed substantially calmer than his predecessor. He was also significantly cheaper than Conte, a world-class coach in the prime of his career, who is now at Chelsea. As it has turned out, the F.I.G.C. got what it paid for. And third: Though Italy is the most surprising absentee from Russia next summer, missing a World Cup for the first time in 60 years, it is not the only major nation that will not be present. The Netherlands missed out, too, and so have Chile, the United States and Cameroon — the champions of South America, North and Central America and Africa. International soccer is no longer the sport’s gold standard; its quality is not as high as once it was. It is, however, more finely balanced than it has ever been. Size is no guarantee of quality — witness Iceland’s qualifying ahead of Turkey — and neither is history. Italy, and the rest, just happened to stumble as the playing field leveled. That is not to say, of course, that Italy can simply continue on its path, change coaches and hope for the best; as the former manager Sacchi said, it is an error to \"seek a scapegoat to salve our conscience,\" to believe an individual can be held responsible for everything in a team sport. Italy was eliminated in the group stage of the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, failing to beat such luminaries as Costa Rica, New Zealand and Slovakia in the process (its record at the European Championship, where there is a notionally higher standard of opponent, is curiously strong in the same time frame). \"This disaster has not come out of the blue,\" as Sacchi said. The problem, though, is less with the future than it is with the past. Massimo Oddo, a part of the 2006 team, said Tuesday that the World Cup victory had tricked the country into thinking \"everything was perfect, that no change, renewal or improvement to our general system of football was necessary.\" Crucially, that extended to the players themselves. That 2006 generation cast the longest of shadows: The fact that, 11 years on, three of its members were on the field in Milan is a measure of how long it has endured. Italy could not quite bring itself to say goodbye, and in doing so, it deprived subsequent generations of air. Now, in the aftermath of Milan, and Sweden, it has no choice. Italy must move on, and it must start again. Those goodbyes were the changes it needed. Italy, at last, has its Year Zero.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/sports/soccer/italy-world-cup.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Kevin Harvick, a Nascar Old-Timer, Seeks Another Championship', 'text': ' A 25-year-old stock-car driver from California named Kevin Harvick stepped into a crowded tent next to the fog-shrouded racetrack at Rockingham, N.C., two days before his first Nascar race. The team owner Richard Childress introduced him as the driver of a white No. 29 Chevrolet, but the real message was that Harvick would be replacing the seven-time series champion Dale Earnhardt Sr., who had been killed five days earlier — Feb. 18, 2001 — on the final lap of the Daytona 500. Harvick finished 14th that weekend and won his third race, the first of 37 victories at Nascar’s top level. He knew that Childress had given him a white No. 29 car because driving Earnhardt’s fearsome black No. 3 would have been far too heavy a burden for any driver, let alone a rookie. Harvick, now 41, is a rookie no more, with 167 top-five finishes behind him, a 400-mile race at Homestead, Fla., on Sunday ahead. \"I definitely feel like I’ve been here for a long time,\" Harvick said. Sunday’s season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway will have a full field, but its Monster Energy Cup will be awarded to the best finisher among four drivers: Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and Brad Keselowski. The four outperformed 12 other drivers in the first nine races of the playoffs. Each finalist except Truex has won a series championship. But Truex has been fast all year. \"You want to be the person who everybody else says: ‘Damn, they’re fast. I just don’t know how we’re going to beat them,’\" said Truex, a Mayetta, N.J., native, who won seven races this year. Busch has won three of the last eight races. Keselowski won a grinding race at Talladega, Ala., and beat out four other drivers on points on Nov. 12 to squeeze into the final four. Harvick won only two races this season, the most recent on Nov. 5 at Fort Worth, Texas, and accumulated the fewest playoff points among the four drivers. Compared to Truex and Busch, Harvick has not been a force. But his two race victories were the fewest since he won one race in 2012. He has finished among the top 10 in five of his last six races and did not complete four races because of crashes. \"He’s such a well-rounded driver,\" Truex said. \"No matter where you go, he’s always able to fight and get that last little bit out of his car.\" Harvick’s team made a much-heralded switch to Fords from Chevys this season, which usually results in a transition period. \"One of my strengths over the years is to be open-minded,\" Harvick said. \"The switch was just a part of that.\" Although the season-opening Daytona 500 is Nascar’s most famous and popular race, the championship race has been established as the Super Bowl for the series, with much heavier obligations to sponsors and the news media. Nascar is also undergoing its own transition — somewhat similar to the shift it went through in the early 2000s, when Harvick joined the series. Two young drivers, Chase Elliott and Ryan Blaney, were among the final eight in contention for the championship race. Harvick is the oldest driver among the four racing for the title Sunday. With the 45-year-old Matt Kenseth and the 43-year-old Dale Earnhardt Jr. planning to step aside after this season, Harvick and the seven-time champ Jimmie Johnson, 42, will be the old-timers. \"I feel like there’s value in experience,\" Harvick said. He remembers that foggy morning in Rockingham clearly. He remembers the hotshot he was: \"Twenty-five years old, didn’t have a care in the world. Didn’t care what anybody else thought.\" He got married less than a week after his top-series debut, and he and his wife, DeLana, have a 5-year-old son, Keelan, who plays tee-ball and is apparently his father’s toughest critic. \"He’s old enough to walk into a room after a race and say, `Dad, why’d you do that?’\" Harvick, who has another baby on the way, said, laughing. \"Life is an evolution.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/sports/autoracing/nascar-kevin-harvick.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '', 'text': '', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/sports/football/jerry-jones-roger-goodell.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'styles': [{'title': 'The Doyenne of DNA Says: Just Chillax With Your Ex', 'text': ' MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — In 2007, Anne Wojcicki, then 33, lassoed the moon. She was getting her new company, 23andMe, a mail-order genetics testing firm, off the ground with her \"Party ’til you spit\" celebrity get-togethers. She married Sergey Brin, the cute co-founder of Google, also 33 and already one of the richest men in America, at a top-secret Esther Williams extravaganza in the Bahamas. The bride in a white bathing suit and the groom in a black one, they swam to a sandbar in the Bahamas and got hitched in the middle of the sparkling aquamarine ocean. Soon after the marriage, as Mr. Brin accumulated more power, a yacht, and a fleet of jets, Ms. Wojcicki became pregnant with the first of their two children and Google invested millions in her start-up, named after the 23 paired chromosomes that consist of our DNA. But six years later, the Silicon Valley fairy tale was shattered by two public humiliations: Mr. Brin got involved with a beautiful young Englishwoman named Amanda Rosenberg, who provided a public face for Google Glass — an attachment that broke up his marriage. And the Food and Drug Administration shut down the primary function of Ms. Wojcicki’s business, calling her D.N.A. spit vial \"an unapproved medical device\" and imposing stricter rules for consumer genetic testing. Her business, once so ripe with promise to tackle health issues, was curtailed to its ancestry testing division. And here is where genetics saved the genetics entrepreneur. Her father, Stanley, fled Poland in 1949 when he was 12 with his mother when the Communists took over. Her mother, Esther, was the daughter of impoverished Orthodox Russian Jews who immigrated to New York in the ’20s. The Wojcickis grew into Silicon Valley royalty. It’s the sort of family, Anne jokes, where \"you’re only a viable fetus once you have your Ph.D.\" Stanley is the former chairman of the Stanford physics department and an emeritus professor. Esther, whose family just wanted her to marry a nice Jewish man and have children, became valedictorian of her high school and got a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley. She is a journalism teacher so beloved at Palo Alto High School that her former student James Franco made a video paean to her. Besides Anne, there are two older daughters, Susan, who was Google employee No. 18 and is now the C.E.O. of YouTube, and Janet, an epidemiologist, medical anthropologist, associate professor at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and a Fulbright scholar. \"My mom is utterly the believer, like she can get anything done,\" says Anne Wojcicki, also known as Baby Woj, now 44. \"She had a real fighter mentality growing up, and I feel that was how we were raised. We’re all super-comfortable in controversy. My mom’s like, ‘Listen, a lot of really bad stuff happened in my life. You either let that control you or you make the rest of your life great.’ Her little brother died when she was little. You don’t let a bad experience hold you back, otherwise you spend the rest of your life ruined by that experience. So it doesn’t matter what happened today. Make it better tomorrow.\" Ms. Wojcicki used that philosophy to claw her way out of her dark hole. \"It was a bad year,\" she says, sitting in her small glass office in her \"uniform\" of Lululemon shorts and shirt and \"company-issued\" jacket. She laughs ruefully. \"I’m pretty optimistic. But we’d occasionally sit around and be like, ‘Wow, it’s really, it’s been really bad.’ Some of my friends and I bought these baseball hats that have these little unicorns attached to them. That was kind of our ‘We’re going to wear these hats and just kind of believe in the potential of what can come.’\" Funnily enough, she grasped at the magical creature as a symbol of hope before it caught on as a popular Silicon Valley term for a billion-dollar start-up, which 23AndMe became in 2015. \"In some ways, when you have that many bad things happen, it’s a sense of disbelief,\" she says. \"This was one of those situations where there’s two aspects. A divorce and the F.D.A. There was no workaround in either. So it was one of the first times in my life where you have to accept, you have to actually change. Like, I need to come up with a different way of approaching both of these relationships.\" Mr. Brin is fortunate that Ms. Wojcicki is not the vengeful type. Once they learned, from his spit test, that he has a rare genetic mutation that increases the risk for Parkinson’s disease, she bought the patent on a gene variant that could protect people who have that Parkinson’s-related mutation. As Vanessa Grigoriadis wrote in Vanity Fair, the love triangle that ended Ms. Wojcicki’s marriage was analyzed in different ways in Silicon Valley. To some, \"it’s about the danger inherent in data sets, when the data includes too much information about one’s mortality. If Brin had never learned about his Parkinson’s risk, he might never have had what a friend of the couple’s characterizes as an emotional crisis and strayed from his wife. (But had Wojcicki not helped him discover his risk for contracting the disease, he might not have enacted the healthy lifestyle choices that may prolong his life.)\" Ms. Wojcicki says that after the separation, she felt like she had entered another dimension, comparing it to stepping through Harry Potter’s Platform 9¾. \"It’s a crazy world and you never knew it existed until you enter it,\" she says. She tried reading a book about divorce but stopped when she got to a story of a divorced man whose ex-wife came over and chopped up his new girlfriend’s underwear. \"I was like, ‘I never want to be one of those people,’\" she says. \"I never want to be angry. For me, it’s a lot of work. I can be angry for 24 hours and then I’m just like, ‘Well, let’s just be friends.’\" It is a sentiment echoed by her mother. \"My theory is that you’re only hurting yourself when you’re angry and revengeful,\" Esther Wojcicki says. \"I was mad at Sergey for what he did. But I don’t carry grudges. He’s the father of my grandchildren. He was not such a good dad when the kids were babies. But he’s a very good dad now. He made his own life difficult, unfortunately. I can still be civil to him. Why not? What’s in it for me being nasty?\" Anne Wojcicki, who saw so much \"Wolf of Wall Street\" behavior and had so many \"We’ll talk about it after the lap dance\" conversations when she was a Wall Street biotech analyst for a decade that she thought she might never want to get married, still speaks fondly of her oddball courtship with Mr. Brin. He would leave her voice mail messages in Morse code or notes about where to meet him in Braille. \"And I’d be like, ‘Ugh, can’t you just tell me where to go?’\" she recalls. \"But it was fun. I feel like you need to balance each other in relationships. Somebody can be totally insane, and then somebody has to buy food and pay rent.\" She says their swimsuit wedding \"was fun because I’m not a hair-and-makeup person. And so I was like, ‘Look, there’s no hair and makeup because I’m swimming.’\" She lights up when she reminisces about \"the beauty and fun of hanging out\" with \"the little team\" of Mr. Brin and his Google co-founder, Larry Page. \"They genuinely see the world in a different way, and that’s what’s fun,\" she says. \"Like, the sky is not blue. It’s some other shade.\" As an example, she describes the time she and Mr. Brin had to take their children to the passport office. After 10 minutes in line, Mr. Brin was able to give the teller a redesign for the office for better traffic flow. Ms. Wojcicki has a big house near Mr. Brin’s big house in Los Altos — where she also owns a children’s cafe and an arcade — and they see a lot of each other. \"For me, it doesn’t matter if we’re married or not,\" she says. \"We have children.\" Like others in Silicon Valley obsessed with living forever, she takes the long view: \"If we’re going to live to 150 years, the reality that you’re going to be with one person for 100 years is low. And so you have to find a way that we can have relationships with people and preserve what’s positive.\" She says she wants to be a model for how to deal with controversy and disappointment to her son and daughter. \"I get really sad when I meet people who have conflict in their family,\" she says. \"Like people who hate their parents or don’t like a sibling or have an acrimonious divorce. Life is just too short.\" One of the friends who helped her through that period was Ivanka Trump, though their relationship has grown more complicated. \"She was super-supportive when I got divorced and had all kinds of issues,\" says Ms. Wojcicki, who was a big Hillary Clinton booster. \"Do I agree with all the things that are happening politically? No. But as a person, the way she treated me, I have a lot of respect for that. And I consider her a friend.\" Two years ago, through friends, Ms. Wojcicki met a strapping man who represented every woman’s dream of how you one-up an ex, especially a Silicon Valley nerd. \"Do you know anything about baseball?\" Ms. Wojcicki asked her friend Michael Specter, a New Yorker staff writer. \"I know how many innings there are, which is more than you know,\" he replied. \"I think I’m starting to date a baseball player,\" she said. Mr. Specter assumed she meant a lawyer who played baseball on the weekends. \"His name is Alex Rodriguez,\" she said. \"I think he plays for the Yankees.\" Mr. Specter explained to the woman who had never attended a professional baseball game that her new suitor was one of the 10 best baseball players who ever lived. \"When I started dating Alex,\" Ms. Wojcicki says, \"my mom was like, ‘What’s an A-Rod?’ I was like, ‘Mom, that’s his name.’\" Being a math wiz, Ms. Wojcicki proceeded to learn every stat. When Mr. Rodriguez saw her watching a YouTube show called \"Physics Girl\" and asked her what it was, she told him, \"It’s like the YES Network but for physics.\" The two enjoyed their cultural-collision romance, once Ms. Wojcicki installed TV sets in her house so A-Rod could watch baseball. \"I didn’t realize that you need special channels to watch sports games,\" she says. \"Alex is a really sweet guy. He’s a smart guy. He’s a good person. Alex lives in this world of cash-flow businesses, and Silicon Valley lives in this world of the potential of the future. So it was actually kind of a really fun conversation. Alex was really into car dealerships, and I was like, ‘We’re all about self-driving cars. Nobody’s going to buy a car. You want to buy a car dealership? I’m going to short your car dealership.’\" At the Met Ball in 2016, in a move described by Vanity Fair as \"head-spinningly civilized,\" the couple arrived in the same car as Mr. Brin and the woman he is now living with, Nicole Shanahan, the founder and C.E.O. of ClearAccessIP. Ms. Wojcicki was carrying a specially designed clutch made from gene chips, the same ones her company runs DNA saliva samples on. Eventually different coasts and parenting obligations pulled her and Mr. Rodriguez apart. \"I liked A-Rod, he was a very nice man,\" Esther Wojcicki told me. \"He came from a Hispanic family. We liked them, they were very sweet. He seemed to be genuinely in love with Anne. But I right away figured out this was a mismatch. He had no academic background. We couldn’t have an intellectual conversation about anything. His main interest in life was something that none of us had ever focused on, which was baseball. He could park himself in front of a TV and watch baseball for 10 hours a day. He wasn’t even sure he wanted to go on the yacht with Anne because the TV might not be working. I wish J-Lo all the luck in the world. \"We couldn’t go anywhere with him. If we went to Target to look for clothes for the kids, all of a sudden we’d be looking around and people would be saying, ‘We just want a selfie with A-Rod.’ He can’t walk across Central Park. He has to take a cab. That will work better with J-Lo because she’s like, ‘Take a picture of me anytime.’\" (The evidence can be seen on the current cover of Vanity Fair, in which an entwined J-Rod gaze longingly into Mario Testino’s lens, and in an inside spread with him pulling up her dress to reveal a crystal-encrusted Tom Ford thong.) Mr. Specter teases Ms. Wojcicki: \"You’ll be the answer to an S.A.T. question: ‘Which woman who dated Alex Rodriguez is not like the others? Kate Hudson, Madonna, J-Lo or Anne Wojcicki.’\" Ms. Wojcicki admits that next time, \"I’d really love to date someone who’s really simple and not famous. My life is already pretty complicated.\" Her mother raised the Wojcicki girls to be skeptical of anything too flashy or polished and to remember that it’s just as easy to wear a jacket in the house as it is to turn up the heat. Even now that she owns a billion-dollar company, Ms. Wojcicki remains frugal and says repeatedly that she does not like \"froufrou things.\" \"Fancy cars and houses and the right dress,\" she says dismissively. \"It’s not a top priority. This is why I’m lucky to have Susan.\" Of her sister, she says, \"Susan went to the Oscars with me last year and literally at 4 o’clock in the afternoon — you’re supposed to be ready at 5 — she’s like, ‘I’m in Macy’s. I found a dress on sale.’ And I’m like, ‘Susan, you kill me.’\" She still rides her bike to work every day — even in the rain — shops at Payless shoes (but also sometimes indulges in Louboutin) and cuts her children’s hair herself. \"That’s actually kind of a disagreement between me and Sergey,\" she says. \"He doesn’t think I do a very good job. And my poor son is very sweet, so he’ll be like, ‘No, Mommy, I love it.’\" She makes an effort to keep her children’s lives from slipping into the \"insanity\" of megawealth. \"I have people who clean the house three days a week,\" she says. \"And I just told them to stop doing laundry on Fridays because my kids need to learn how to do laundry on Fridays. It’s so easy to be like, ‘I don’t have to do laundry again. I don’t have to cook again.’ But then you’re not normal. I have a new rule lately. I just don’t go out on weekdays. If I’m raising kids, I need to be focused on helping implement that normalcy.\" Sometimes she lets them wear their clothes to bed because it saves time in the morning. \"The other thing I used to do, when we’d travel in the summers, because I don’t like to pack a lot,\" she says, \"and so I’d have the kids bathe in their clothes and then they change into something else. And then their clothes are clean for the next day. Versus the hotel laundry, which is so expensive.\" She’s focused for now on her children, her new Bengal cats and her company, which has more than three million customers and its own drug-development program. It started selling kits in CVS and Target, got the F.D.A.’s permission to resume giving consumers health reports on 10 conditions, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, and the $99 ancestry kit won a spot as one of \"Oprah’s favorite things\" this year, with Oprah calling it \"The Ultimate Selfie.\" Fast Company portrayed Ms. Wojcicki as the Comeback Kid of tech. She realized that she had a treasure trove of DNA data and began teaming with Genentech and Procter & Gamble, which started mining it to make breakthroughs in Parkinson’s, depression and skin care. In many ways, her struggle with the F.D.A. was a microcosm of the increasingly tense battle between hidebound regulatory agencies and freewheeling tech companies. Although some people thought Ms. Wojcicki would have to sell her company, she healed the breach with the F.D.A. the same way she healed the breach with Mr. Brin. She did not huff away and seethe and backbite. She \"put one foot ahead of the other,\" as her mother advises, hired the best regulatory experts and found a respectful new configuration for the relationship. \"We were not communicating in the right way,\" she says of the period the F.D.A. felt it was being ignored. \"We were not showing Silicon Valley arrogance. We just were running around with our shoes on in a Japanese house. We were not a cultural fit and we weren’t expressing what we were trying to do in the right way. \"Some companies are trying to circumvent the regulators. We weren’t. We just got caught in the cross hairs. We clearly pissed them off. It took us a long time to generate a lot of data to prove that our intentions actually were right. But I feel like we’re doing the right thing in terms of proving that the customer is capable of getting this information on their own. \"I see it from the F.D.A. perspective. It’s a new product. It’s genetics. It’s direct to consumer. It caused anxiety. So, you know, the onus was on us.\" She had to explain to her team: \"Listen, when you go to the D.M.V., you don’t argue about the vision test. You don’t say, ‘Oh, I just had a vision test. I don’t need to do the vision test.’ Like, you just do it. The F.D.A. is in charge of public safety, and I have a respect for the job that they have to do. And we’re just going to do the job that they’re asking us to do.\" I ask her if Harvey Weinstein, an early investor, is still involved. \"Once an investor, always an investor. It’s like ‘Hotel California,’\" she says. \"He has always been supportive of the company and of me, but he clearly has behavior that you can’t possibly condone. You recognize that people can have two different worlds. So it’s disappointing.\" She said that her best mentors have been Arianna Huffington and Diane von Furstenberg. \"They are the two people who are just like, ‘I want to support women. I want to support you doing awesome things. I believe in you. You can do it.’\" I tell her that I am too scared to take her spit test. I don’t want to know if my father wasn’t my father, or if I’m German and not Irish, or if the future holds some hideous disease. \"Genetics is like your cholesterol test,\" she says. \"So your cholesterol test is going to tell you if you have high cholesterol, which is a risk factor for heart disease. But it’s not saying you’re going to die immediately from heart disease or even die at all from heart disease. It’s just saying you have a risk factor. And so genetics is similar. It’s saying you have a risk factor. So the beauty to me of genetics is, it’s always a story of hope.\" RELATED: Maureen Dowd plays Confirm or Deny with Anne Wojcicki.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/style/anne-wojcicki-23andme-genetics.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'For the First Family of Pleasure Products, Toys Are Us', 'text': ' LOS ANGELES — Back in 1976, when Chad Braverman’s father, Ron, invested a small grubstake in a manufacturing start-up, consumers bought his products at the back of seedy bookstores and scurried out with their purchases concealed in brown paper bags. The younger Mr. Braverman, who was not yet born, grew up ignorant of how his father actually made a living. He would be well into his teens before learning that the company his father ran with a partner was not, as he had long supposed, some sort of criminal enterprise. \"It was this big mystery no one ever talked about, what my dad was making,\" Mr. Braverman, now 35, said recently at the North Hollywood offices of Doc Johnson Enterprises, the family firm. \"For a long time I just thought he was in the Mafia.\" What Ronald A. Braverman did was make rubber penises. He also manufactured latex vaginas and hand-shaped items devised for anal insertion and a variety of other novelties associated with masturbatory pleasures. In the evolving parlance of successive eras, those items were euphemistically known first as marital aids — as though a vibrator were a couples counselor — and then sex toys and, eventually, \"pleasure products.\" It was still a shadowy niche business when Mr. Braverman founded Doc Johnson, but the company would go on to become the largest producer in what is estimated to be a $15 billion global industry. And the Bravermans — Ronald, Chad and his sister, Erica, 29 — would become, de facto, the first family of sex toys. \"Sure, people used to joke about it,\" Chad said. \"Does your dad really make rubber penises? But then by the time I was in college, it suddenly flipped, and it made me the coolest person around.\" On a day of scorching heat and dry Santa Ana winds gusting over the mountains, the two of us sat in an air-conditioned office at the Doc Johnson headquarters in North Hollywood. Bearded and muscled, Mr. Braverman was clad in Acne jeans, a Buck Mason shirt and a pair of pink Common Products sneakers. Behind his desk a wall of bookshelves held the sports trophies he collects, among them signed Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Wilt Chamberlain basketballs. If Mr. Braverman conforms less to a cliché of how a businessman whose company produces Palm Pals and Legendary John Holmes dildos might look than to that of a young venture capitalist, that is partly because pleasure products have become mainstream enough for Los Angeles Magazine to call Doc Johnson \"the Procter & Gamble of sex toys.\" There is a certain accuracy in the characterization, since almost 75 percent of Doc Johnson products are manufactured in one of seven structures scattered across a sprawling 250,000-square-foot compound, and a \"Made in America\" emblem is a central element of the Doc Johnson marketing strategy. Here, in the industrial eastern part of the San Fernando Valley, hundreds of workers sculpture, mold, paint, pack and ship the 75,000 products Doc Johnson manufactures weekly. Here, employees in white coats and surgical caps blend six tons of raw material every day, pouring dildos and using air guns to pop each one out of its mold. Here, brass plaques hung in a lobby commemorate employment milestones by generations of mostly Hispanic employees who have raised families on wages earned fabricating devices like Doc Johnson’s best-selling Sasha Grey Masturbator, a lifelike reproduction of the genitals of Ms. Grey, a onetime pornographic star, molded in a casting room on site. \"We now look at what we’re doing as being about creating an experience, like entertainment,\" Mr. Braverman said, adding that his company’s trademarked new Kink by Doc Johnson line of products — rubber sheets, dog collars and assorted fetish gizmos — \"is really killing it.\" If historically \"there was not a lot of brand loyalty and brand awareness\" in the sex toy industry, as Mr. Braverman said, that is quickly being modified as manufacturers adapt to an increasingly savvy and fast-growing consumer base. \"The adult novelty sector is booming,\" said Lynn Comella, associate professor of sexuality and gender studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and author of the newly published \"Vibrator Nation.\" After studying the industry for close to two decades, Professor Comella observed a notable shift in the scale and nature of the business after the financial crisis of 2008. \"Suddenly porn sales weren’t what they had been,\" she said. Piracy and proliferating free online pornographic sites decimated an industry long considered recession-proof. Yet by 2009, at seminars held during the annual Adult Novelty Manufacturers Expo — where, as Forbes noted, retailers connect with \"the latest lubes, vibrators and RealDolls\" — Ms. Comella found herself attending panels that resembled first-wave-feminist consciousness-raising sessions. \"They were literally called ‘What Do Women Want?’’’ she said. It seemed, she said, that everyone, from chief executives to buyers for sex toy stores, was eager to discuss how to recalibrate a business that, as Ron Braverman explained, \"had gone from being 100 percent male dominated — male manufacturers, male bookstore owners, men going to select the product and bring it home — to being an absolutely female-oriented consumer product.\" As abrupt as the shift seemed at the time, its origins were not altogether surprising. In her book, Ms. Comella argues that, absent the early feminist sex educators and entrepreneurs behind such enlightened sex toy shops as Good Vibrations in San Francisco, success would have been less probable for a mainstream manufacturer like Doc Johnson, whose products are now sold by 7,500 brick-and-mortar stores throughout the United States, on sex-oriented sites like PinkCherry and Lovehoney, and, increasingly, by mass-market retailers. Unwittingly or not, the \"feminist trend of educating women about their bodies, about their clitorises, about vibrators as a tool of self-empowerment,\" Ms. Camella said, ultimately benefited the sex toy business by altering cultural perceptions of it and initiating its migration from XXX bookshops to Walmart, Amazon and Target. Certainly it is hard to imagine that, without the sex-positive credos advanced by female proprietors of early sex toy shops like Good Vibrations, Eve’s Garden and Babeland, Charlotte York’s famous Rabbit episode in Season 1 of \"Sex and the City\" would have become part of the cultural conversation, let alone \"Toyz,\" Missy Elliott’s ribald 2012 paean to self-sufficiency, or Abbi Abrams, a character on \"Broad City,\" and her celebrated strap-on. The success of a \"Broad City\" plotline involving anal penetration of a more-than-willing male partner by the character portrayed by the show’s co-creator Abbi Jacobson would ultimately inspire Comedy Central, which broadcasts the show, to introduce its own line of plugs and gadgets, most notably, perhaps, a Pegasus Pegging Kit. And it underscored an observation made recently by Susan Colvin, a former college instructor turned sex toy manufacturer. \"The younger generation doesn’t have as many hang-ups as ours did,\" said Ms. Colvin, whose California-based CalExotics was founded in the 1970s and was responsible for introducing early innovations like vibrators in Easter egg colors, a notion first put forward by Ms. Colvin’s all-female development team. \"It used to be, ‘Gee, I’m a man, why would you need any of that?’\" Ms. Colvin said. \"Now it’s the woman doing the consuming, and it’s not so intimidating for a partner when she introduces a toy into a relationship.\" As seemingly everywhere else in the culture, it is a millennial generation that is leading the charge in mainstream acceptance of a business few still associate with its back-alley beginnings. \"Sometimes even people in the industry for decades don’t realize how accepted sex toys now are,\" said Erica Braverman, the marketing director at Doc Johnson. As an example, Ms. Braverman cited the pop-up Doc Johnson sponsored last month at the Think Tank gallery in Downtown Los Angeles in collaboration with the artist Whitney Bell. Dildos glowed under black light in a V.I.P. room as D.J.s spun from a set list of modish 1990s tunes. After ogling a prototype sex toy vending machine that will soon be sent on a multicity cross-country tour, the hundreds of guests who started lining up at 7 p.m. struck selfie poses against a backdrop tailor-made for Instagram. Some carried props depicting peach or eggplant emojis, or signs that read, \"My Name Ain’t Baby\" and \"Matriarchy Now.’’ Hung from a wire grid on the ceiling were 200 Doc Johnson penis replicas ranging in size from the statistical average of under six inches to dildos of Brobdingnagian scale. \"I’m 29, and it’s pretty amazing to me how far feminism has come, that it’s considered cool now for women to take control of their own pleasure and fun,\" Ms. Braverman said. Just six years separate the two Braverman siblings, and yet one grew up unaware of what the family business was, while the other went to college knowing that full, freaky disclosure was just a Google search away. \"When I went to college and told people I’m in the family business, no one blinked an eye in a negative way,\" Ms. Braverman said. \"It was more like, ‘OMG, what about Christmas? My birthday is coming up. What am I going to get?’\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/style/doc-johnson-sex-toys.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'My Vagina Is Terrific. Your Opinion About It Is Not.', 'text': ' There is a rash of men explaining vaginas to me. That is what I have decided to name a collective of mansplainers. A murder of crows, a parliament of owls, a rash of mansplainers. In medicine a rash can be a mild annoyance that goes away and never returns. A rash can also portend a serious medical condition, even something malignant. There have always been a few men here and there explaining vaginas to me. I have suffered fools eager to use pickup lines about being an amateur gynecologist, detailing their imagined superior knowledge of female anatomy and physiology. Men who think sitting beside them at a bar and smiling — because if you don’t smile, you get told to smile — is an invitation to tell you how they will make you scream and moan. I know that many other women have had their vaginas explained to them, because for the past 25 years my career has been dedicated to treating vaginal and vulvar problems. I have listened to women with completely normal exams weep that they have been told that they do not smell or taste correctly. That they are too wet, or too loose, or too gross. These women all shared something: They were told these things by men. While I admit this is anecdotal data, my years of listening to secret shame about healthy vaginas and vulvas seems to suggest it is largely, if not entirely, male partners who exploit vaginal and vulvar insecurities as a weapon of emotional abuse and control. But it was the Vicks VapoRub that put me over the edge. Around the internet I am known as the gynecologist who debunks unnecessary and often harmful vaginal trends. Vaginal steaming, douches, glitter, tightening sticks — these are all born from the same need to tame the normal female genital tract. Whether these products are sold by big companies or a lone purveyor on Etsy, whether sold as medicinal in drugstores or marketed under the guise of \"natural\" and artisanal by brands like Goop, the intent is the same: to monetize intimate fears about intimate places. The idea is to profit from our society’s inability to have public, non-sophomoric discussions about the vagina and vulva. These products and their messages are no different from the Lysol ads telling women they could be like the \"the girl he married\" again. Now, apparently, folks were suggesting that it was a good idea to put a mentholated petroleum product in one’s vagina. (It is not.) Fed up, I wrote the story of how a man had tried to shame me about my healthy vagina. Once, I had dated a man who told me I would be desirable, if only my hair were straight, or if only I lost the weight, or if only I dressed differently. The metric for my supposed perfection kept changing, so it was a herculean task to keep up with my failings, which I now gather was the point. But while I may not have complete confidence in my appearance, I have professional confidence in spades. There are few people, if any, who know more about the lower genital tract than I do. So when this man began to tell me how my healthy vagina could be better, I dumped him. It didn’t seem weird or overly personal to write this one paragraph about my experience. I talk about vaginas all day long. It is the inability to talk about vaginas without shame that is at the very core of genital-tract profiteering. If a gynecologist who specializes in vulvar and vaginal health can’t talk about it, then who can? I have revealed details of my son’s death, and that feels far more intimate and emotionally daring to me. What happened next was an article showed up in the The New York Post with the incorrect headline \"My boyfriend dumped me because of my vagina smell,\" accompanied with a big picture of me. The article itself was accurate — easy enough, since it was essentially quotations from my blog. And then the men came. They came to share their opinions regarding my vagina, writing on my blog and at me on Twitter. They flocked to my Instagram and my Facebook. One group of gentlemen, in at least their 40s, even decided that this story of me being dumped supposedly because of my vagina was worthy of a laugh on their podcast. This rash bombarded me in both public and private comments. Men wondered if I had washed \"that thang yet?\" One man wrote that I \"must be INTO smelly ones! How nice for you — we prefer FRESH as a daisy ones!\" Another man warned me that \"We men had a meeting, all 3.5 billion of us.\" At the meeting they had apparently decided to \"double down on calling out\" my smelly vagina. A man said I should call my ex and thank him \"for alerting me to my smelly vagina.\" There was also the #notallmen contingent, who felt it was impossible that my personal experience and 25 years as a gynecologist could offer any evidence that men ever try to control women by preying on insecurities. Obviously it was just my vagina that stank. More men sought me out to explain vaginas to me. They gave me false information on how to clean and prep them (for men, of course), and told me how gross my vagina must be, and hurled insults that I cannot print here. The state of my healthy vagina brought more scorn from men than anything I have ever written about — and I write about second trimester abortions, so that is saying something. To the women who have been told they were too wet, too dry, too messy, too smelly, too gross, too saggy or too bloody, I have heard you. I know you stand in drugstores wondering why there are all these hygiene products if they are unnecessary. I know you stare into the internet and wonder, if celebrities say they steam their vaginas, or have 10-step vaginal prep regimens, then maybe vaginal neglect really is a flaw that ruins relationships. All I can say is, if you have a medical concern, see a doctor. And: If someone speaks to you about your body with anything but kindness and concern, it is he who has a problem. And: The vagina is like a self-cleaning oven. To the rash of mansplainers and The New York Post, thank you. This experience proves that shaming women about physiologically normal and functioning vaginas is epidemic. The cure for this rash is information. You can either listen and learn or you can take a seat in the back of class and shut up. The era in which men can shame women for their perfectly healthy vaginas is now coming to an end.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/style/my-vagina-is-terrific-your-opinion-about-it-is-not.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The New Wave of Wellness-Oriented Bath Products', 'text': ' Like so many other things, baths have recently reached a new level of wellness: The bubbly elixirs of the past have now been replaced with high-performance essentials with advanced skincare ingredients and spirit-boosting add-ons. To buff away dead skin and revitalize limbs this winter, try Aesop’s Redemption Body Scrub ($35), which contains milled pumice and bamboo stem, plus a dose of refreshing fir and pine needle essential oils. For the body-care equivalent of your face serum, there’s Ren’s Atlantic Kelp and Microalgae Anti-Fatigue Bath Oil ($30): The blend of kelp, plankton and algae oil is rich in \"potent antioxidants, which have anti-inflammatory functions and may enhance wound healing,\" explains the Los Angeles-based dermatologist Dr. Kelly Bickle. It would be hard to say the same of the fizzy bath bombs from decades ago, which featured drying surfactants that often outnumbered natural ingredients in formulas. Post-bath, blot with a towel lather on a moisturizer like physician Dr. Barbara Sturm’s Anti-Aging Body Cream ($105), with healing vitamins C and E, and softening lactic acid. Embrace the ritual of having to rub it in. \"The thicker the cream, the more effective it will be at trapping in water and hydrating your skin,\" says Dr. Bickle. Still, not all new-world remedies are radically new. Consider Pursoma’s After the Class ($34; launching on November 15) — a post-workout soak that comes with a crystal to guide your intention (amethyst for wisdom and spirituality; citrine for joy and prosperity). The active ingredient, however, is magnesium sulfate which, as Dr. Bickle points out, is another name for Epsom salt. Granny connotations aside, the classic mineral compound \"works by inhibiting muscle contractions and relaxing muscles,\" she says. The crystal’s powers, on the other hand, are open to interpretation. \"Crystals are beautiful, and I think good at helping us guide our energy in a certain direction. But there is no medical data on the benefits.\" As someone who bathes daily, though, Dr. Bickle has this advice: \"If taking care of yourself means soaking in a bath and holding a piece of rose quartz next to you, then do it.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/t-magazine/wellness-bath-products.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '', 'text': '', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/t-magazine/design/paris-restaurants.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Classic Scottish Knits, Updated', 'text': ' For a style first popularized in the 1920s by Edward VIII, then Prince of Wales, Fair Isle knits have a remarkable staying power.

This window of readiness is brief: 12 to 24 hours. When I detect that ovulation is imminent, the vial is defrosted. Ninety minutes later, 17 million sperm are inserted into my uterus via a catheter. I do this because I am 39 and single and my craving for a child eclipses everything else, including my secret fear that this process will be successful. The donor I have chosen is tall, well educated, lean, laconic, a chemical engineer who researches renewables. He’s a cyclist, they tell me, who clicks down the halls of the center in his special cycling shoes. Affable but not warm. His mother’s people are Tatars, Muslim nomads from the Central Asian Steppe. I like all that he seems to represent: intellect, precision, hardiness, planetary repair. One week each month I pee daily on a test strip and wait for either an empty circle, which means the window is closed, or a smiley face, indicating an egg’s imminent release. At a bachelorette dinner for a friend in late July, I met Sadie. She was loud, brash, a presence. From across the table, I overheard her describing plans to drive south for the coming eclipse, and a deep longing welled up inside me. \"If you have space —— \" I said. \"We may.\" By the wedding on Aug. 6, I was two days late, my breasts sore and engorged. A pregnancy test came back negative, but I was certain it was wrong. I felt swollen with a secret, sacred hope. As the wedding came to a close, a band of pressure began constricting around my temples; my progesterone levels were falling fast. The blood, when it came, seemed to originate from somewhere deeper and more mysterious than my womb. I felt as if I were bleeding out dreams. When Sadie’s email and itinerary arrived the following day, I was strangely touched. Each line read like a mouthwatering, carefully constructed dish: \"Sunday 11 a.m. — we should hit this 60-foot rock slide. And Sunday 7 p.m. — shindig on the Green in Asheville. Bring instruments!\" There were four of us going: Sadie; her husband, Steve; and, from what I could deduce, an elderly relation named Eli. \"Eli doesn’t text or use email,\" Sadie wrote. \"So I will call him.\" They arrived early Saturday morning with a fiddle, a ukulele and Eli, who stood quietly to the side, a guitar case slung across his back. He was my height, and younger, his sandy hair thinning on top. He had a soccer player’s build, side burns, a square jaw: pleasant looking but not my type. Then off we went down Interstate 81 along the verdant folds of the Shenandoah with Eli driving. Passing a sign for Charlottesville, Va., where white nationalists had gathered a week earlier, Steve said, \"Did you see the video of that guy Cantwell?\" \"The crying Nazi!\" I said. \"But I get it, how trapped and cheated he must have felt.\" Eli said, \"Save your sympathy.\" Every day for me is an exercise in letting go. I have to let go of rage. I have to let go of fear. I have to let go of everything I thought my life would be and isn’t. Steve looked up from his phone and said, \"We’re on this road for 247 miles.\" Sadie said, \"The people in the back have to give back rubs to the people in the front.\" And then, before I let myself think, I reached over and squeezed Eli’s shoulders. Through his T-shirt, I could feel the musculature of his back, his spine, its finger holds. It had been a long time since I had touched a man. Doing so now felt decadent and exhilarating. There was a hunger in my hands, an urgency. From her phone, Sadie started playing \"The Ashokan Farewell,\" two violin strings singing at the same time. Under my thumbs, Eli craned his neck to the right. It was an invitation. I wanted to touch him, down to the bone. The four of us shared one room with two queen beds. Crawling under the sheets later that night, Eli was looking at me. For the first time, I noticed his eyes, bright blue. Because Steve snores, Eli handed me two foam earplugs, which I pinched flat, then threaded into my ears. As they expanded, the room grew muffled, safe. I had brought sleep masks, one for me and a spare, which I shared with Eli. We lay in the bed, he on his side, me on mine. In the dark I thought: \"Where are you? Come closer!\" It was a blind progression of intrepid searching, inch by inch. I bumped into him and he did not pull away. And that’s how it happens, how we find each other. On Monday at dawn we drove a final hour south on empty roads meandering through mist-filled forests. The light filtered down, dim and soft. Within the gates of the public park that Sadie had selected, we claimed a table, setting out snacks and spreading blankets in the shade by a lake. \"I think this lake,\" said Steve, pointing, \"is used to absorb the excess heat of the nuclear plant over there.\" Eli followed me down into the water, which was oddly warm, and I wondered, despondently, \"What have we done here?\" We huddled together in the shallow waters where a snapping turtle was sunning itself on a log. After, I went to the restroom and peed in a cup. The circle that appeared was perfectly empty, a blank white sun. When I went back outside, the light had begun to change, growing dimmer. Eli was lying on his back. I lay down beside him. Sadie and Steve had brought eclipse glasses and special binoculars. Through the glasses, the sun was small and orange, like a yolk. But through the binoculars, it was enormous and white, the International Space Station hovering before it like a speck of dust on the lens. We lay on our backs, all four of us, and stared at the sky. It began as a slice, a piece of the sun cut away. We traded glasses, waited and watched. A bearded man pointed out how the shadows through the trees had softened, turning into gentle half-moon crests. It was all so strange. Periodically, when we put on the glasses, we could see the sun disappearing, losing its shape. Everything happened as the scientists said. The twilight deepened. The crickets began to chirp. Stars appeared. The moon whittled down the sun to one final sliver then slipped quietly into place, aligning itself as gently as Eli had aligned himself alongside me, one body blanketing another so perfectly, so completely. I was, we were all, for the briefest breath of time, made whole. All around the lake, in the darkness, people gasped, cried out, broke into applause. Under his breath and with a reverential sigh, Steve said, \"Damn.\" Through the glasses, the sky had become entirely black. \"I can’t see anything,\" Eli said, groping the earth. \"What’s happening?\" \"Take off the glasses!\" Sadie said. For two minutes and 27 seconds, it was possible to look directly at the sun’s corona, the only visible remainder of light. Greedily, naked-eyed, we stared at the black orb obscuring the sun like a hole in the sky. I could feel my heart breaking open. Eli pressed his foot hard against mine and the pressure changed me, dilating my eyes. Dopamine surged, flooding me with joy. I thought: I won’t be alone after all. Then a searing, liquid-white light began spilling out over the edge of the blackness. \"Glasses on!\" And it was over, time to drive home. The perfect alignment of the universe had shifted. \"We’re on this road another 217 miles,\" Steve said, staring into the traffic ahead. I was driving, and Sadie had fallen asleep. Do they see us from space, I wondered, all of us down here in our cars, a long, flickering, incandescent thread? From the back seat, Eli reached up to touch the back of my neck. I wanted to live in that moment forever, to tether myself to that particular point in time. I wanted to take the moment and bend it like a ray of light, extract its color and orbit it endlessly like a sun. But our planet moves through space at the rate of 18 miles per second — 18 miles per second! — and I did not hear from Eli again. This isn’t the ending I wanted, but it was remarkable to see, remarkable to experience, coming home that night in a chain of cars, so festive, wending through the darkness, the snaking, synchronized way in which we all progressed, each of us so insolently persistent in reaching our own particular destination.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/style/modern-love-17-million-frozen-sperm.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'For Lisa Eisner, ‘Money Never, Ever Motivates Me’', 'text': ' LOS ANGELES — Lisa Eisner is trying to get us killed. We are in her Lexus wagon, slicing through three lanes of high-speed traffic from Interstate 605 at the Interstate 5 interchange. I am daydreaming vaguely about another Los Angeles road scene: barefoot Mariah Wyeth in her Camaro and the famous Hollywood to Harbor freeway lane-change passage in \"Play It as It Lays.\" Ms. Eisner is flicking her eyes from the road to Waze on her iPhone when suddenly I glance up and notice that the car in the lane ahead of us has come to a halt. Cue an adrenaline rush and a shout of terror. Visualize high-speed swerve. Imagine woman wearing an embroidered cotton Mexican shift, just like the one Linda Kasabian wore to court in the Manson trial, and pony skin Tomas Maier clogs letting loose a stream of invective, followed by a moment of out-of-body serenity. \"Oh, man,\" Ms. Eisner says. \"Oh, man.\" The two of us are returning to Hollywood from Santa Fe Springs, an arid gateway city at the southeast edge of Los Angeles County where we had been visiting a hot-rod body shop established in the 1940s as the Moon Equipment Company but that everyone knows as Mooneyes. It is the sort of place you might go to if you were looking to acquire a 15-inch California Metal Flake Ginger Grip steering wheel. And it is the sort of anachronism that survives in this alternately booming and time-stopped city, one where glass office towers have all but erased evidence of a beloved squat and funky western stretch of Sunset Boulevard (farewell, House of Blues) and yet where Philip Marlowe’s office building at Hollywood and Cahuenga Boulevards still stands. When people write about Lisa Eisner, they often describe her, lazily, as a multi-hyphenate, as though having a free-ranging sensibility were a syndrome and not a cast of mind. \"I don’t think I’ve ever had one day in my life where it has repeated\" a routine from the one before, says Ms. Eisner, a statement that is not 100 percent true. Lately Ms. Eisner has settled on a single identity, that of a jeweler, largely self-taught. The jewels she makes are knobby, organic and spidery and often cast in bronze. They are usually inset with peculiar rocks she gathers at the annual Tucson Gem Show: black or fire opals, pitted hunks of turquoise from the ancient Kingman mine. Many bear a close resemblance to traditional Navajo jewelry or else to the ornaments old-time cowmen once wore. The jeweled bolo slung around Julia Roberts’s neck on the December cover of InStyle is her design. At various points in her long … adventure is probably a better word here than career, Lisa Eisner has worked as a fashion editor, a stylist, a photographer and a publisher. She has also been — as T: The New York Times Style Magazine, noted several years ago — an impressive \"collector and connector,\" a woman who at 60 seems to have met or known or worked with virtually everyone along the global fashion caravan and also Hollywood. She lives here with her husband, Eric, an entertainment lawyer and philanthropist (his Yes Scholars foundation works with academically gifted students from impoverished neighborhoods) and one of their two sons, in an eccentrically furnished Cliff May house in a section of the city known as old Bel-Air. One way or another, Ms. Eisner has traveled a long way from Greybull, Wyo., where she was born, and along a route so fascinatingly loopy and vagrant that it seems somehow logical that Ann Philbin, the director of the Hammer Museum, would turn to Ms. Eisner to create its latest pop-up shop. \"Lisa has a very particular mind-set,\" Ms. Philbin said, considerably understating the case. Take the name of the pop-up, Rat Bastards, a homage to an informal club the artist Bruce Conner convened in the 1950s for himself and his friends. That particular club was more conceptual than conventional, and correspondingly Ms. Eisner’s Rat Bastards is as much art installation as retail experience. \"Eric always laughs,\" Ms. Eisner says, referring to her husband. \"He says, ‘You’re never going to make a dime.’ I tell him, ‘That’s right, brother!’ Money never, ever motivates me.\" Mr. Conner was many things over the course of his wide-ranging, influential and still-underappreciated career — avant-garde filmmaker, collagist, a creator of elegant inkblot drawings that look like Rorschach tests. But it is his assemblages he is best known for: disturbing and yet humorous sculptures collaged from furniture, doll parts, jewelry, candles, mandalas and whatever other flotsam on the slipstream of late-20th-century culture caught his eye. Created in Mr. Conner’s spirit, Rat Bastards is probably best understood as assemblage. \"I actually always have a hard time saying what I do,\" Ms. Eisner says. \"It’s really hard for people to put other people into more than one category.\" Most brains don’t function like that, she says, although what she means is the brains of those from her generation. \"For the new generations, the kids, that’s all they do is a million different things,\" she says. It can seem as if a million different things are going on simultaneously at Rat Bastards, a narrow rectangular space off the museum’s main bookstore reached through sets of Japanese door curtains painted by Ms. Eisner’s son Louis — an artist who commutes between Los Angeles and Mexico City — with a logo that itself is a homage to the Rat Fink characters devised by the cartoonist and custom car designer Ed Roth (known as Big Daddy). It was Rat Fink material that had sent us to Mooneyes, which maintains the brand. Ms Eisner wanted to restock items for the shop and gather others, including Mooneyes T-shirts and jackets with the company’s trademarked logo of big googly eyes. She planned to wedge them in somehow alongside the peerless handmade patches Brad Dunning designed for the proto-punk band the Cramps; the sets of girlie pink underpants embroidered with the days of the week; the vintage T-shirts and posters from the photographer Bruce Weber’s personal collection; the artist Ben Noam’s ceramic mushroom sculptures; the ironically goofy leather patches hand-tooled by Andrew Sexton, a Yale-educated artist who often collaborates with Sterling Ruby; the mugs and paperweights using graphics designed by the American activist nun Sister Corita Kent; the diamond piñatas made for Rat Bastards by Nicholas Anderson and Julie Ho, working as Confetti System; the specially commissioned T-shirts from the Hollywood Forever cemetery; the exquisite porcelain vessels created by the Canadian potter Kayo O’Young; the neo-minimalist chairs and tables constructed by Michael Boyd; the boxed Tom of Finland dolls accessorized with snap-on erections; the gold mesh necklaces and gauntlets the costumer designer Michael Schmidt creates for Dita von Teese, Cher, Rihanna and others; the shirts airbrushed by Louis Eisner with images inspired by Ed Roth; the framed labels from a line of men’s wear once produced by the Black Panthers leader Eldridge Cleaver and embroidered with his name. These things represent barely a fraction of the totality of Rat Bastards, whose frenetic eclecticism is oddly belied by the shop’s serene installation. It probably helps that a heady hippie fragrance wafts from an atomizer in the shop, the scent itself devised by Ms. Eisner in collaboration with the perfumer Haley Alexander van Oosten and named — for what seem like autobiographically pertinent reasons — Nomad 1957. \"I probably have something of an A.D.D. personality, for sure,\" Ms. Eisner says. \"I see Tom, or people around me, who like a routine and a schedule,\" she says, referring to her close friend Tom Ford, whose specially commissioned bandannas sold out the day Rat Bastards opened in early October. \"I even look at people in the Olympics that are really good at one thing,\" says a woman who once characterized her personal style credo as \"Keep People Guessing.\" \"That could never be me,\" Ms. Eisner says. \"The gods did not give me that.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/style/lisa-eisner-designer-rat-bastards-hammer-museum.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '', 'text': '', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/style/french-montana-shops-for-tracksuits-and-timberlands-in-the-bronx.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Thanksgiving, Solved! How to Deal With This Dreadful Holiday', 'text': ' My wife and I have been married for two years and dated for three before that. That’s five horrendous Thanksgivings with her extended family. (Mine is abroad.) Her father needles us about politics; her mother criticizes our clothes, apartment and friends. Last year, she told me my job wasn’t \"masculine.\" It’s total conflict. This year, my wife and I agreed to skip the long drive and celebrate with friends. But when she got off the phone with her mother, not only had she not canceled, she’d agreed to bring the stuffing. Any way to fix this? GEORGE I assume you’ve considered (and rejected, for your own good reasons) the obvious solution here: Make the stuffing with chestnuts and Xanax, and turn down the heat on your holiday. Try to be sympathetic with your wife, George. It’s not easy to slay parental dragons on your first try. (And in the interest of fair play, children can be dragons, too.) Thanksgiving sounds like a certified bummer with your wife’s clan. But you don’t mention whether she or you has previously registered any complaints with her parents about the way they roll. Until you tell them they’re upsetting you, they may pride themselves on being straight shooters. Speak to them calmly — which can be herculean — and in person, when it’s just the four of you. (I’m thinking Wednesday night around the kitchen table.) Now, if you’ve already tried this, or worse, tried it several times, here is a pearl gleaned from 20 years of loving partnership: Sometimes it’s easier for our spouses to throw us under the bus than it is to take on their own seriously recalcitrant parents. Your wife can say, \"Sorry, George doesn’t want to come this year.\" They may think worse of you. (Do you care?) But you and your wife skate away clean. (And when you can, drop a line about your \"feminine\" career. Inquiring minds will want to know.) I am a college-age lesbian. I have been living with my girlfriend for two years. We’re out, and my family is supportive. But they don’t introduce us as girlfriends. So, my youngest cousins are very curious about who my girlfriend is and why she’s with us at holidays. Can we tell them if they ask? ANONYMOUS Why not? By 4 or 5, children have notions of romantic arrangements, however imperfect. My friend’s preschooler has taken to announcing that he intends to marry his mother. It’s just his imprecise way of saying he loves her, right? Still, talking about sex with other people’s children is better avoided. So, respond: \"She’s my girlfriend\" and leave it at that, O.K.? I have three very close friends. We agreed to spend Thanksgiving together at the country house of one of their parents. (The parents won’t be there.) Last week, the sister of one friend had a bad health scare. So, that friend opted out of the trip. Then another canceled for bogus reasons, leaving me and the hostess. I canceled because Thanksgiving for two sounded weird. Now, the hostess has group-texted us to say that she wants to be reimbursed for $200 she spent on food. Does this seem right? GINA Let’s start with the truly impressive morsel. Your hostess racked up $200 in food bills before 90 percent of us have even started our shopping lists. (She’s probably lying, but still, hats off to fantasy organizational skills!) When the dominoes of group travel begin to fall, they fall fast. No surprise, then, that when your first pal opted out, the trip collapsed pretty quickly. My hunch: Your hostess’s request for reimbursement stems from hurt feelings. Only one of you had a legitimate excuse; the rest of you just bailed. In your place, I would say: \"Of course! I’m sorry we inconvenienced you.\" You can ask about a jointly prepared feast with the jointly purchased food. But more important, include the hostess in your ultimate Thanksgiving plans. It would be a drag for her to end up solo after she’d opened her home to her three besties. I am 28 and trying hard to watch what I eat. I am 25 pounds overweight, according to my doctor, and because of family history with obesity-related illnesses, I am taking her warning seriously. The problem: my grandmother. Unless we roll out of her house (literally) on Thanksgiving, she acts insulted, as if we’ve criticized her by eating normal portions. What can I do? ANONYMOUS The first thing to recognize is that your grandmother may have a limited repertoire for showing you how much she loves you. Feeding you is a classic. (Shout out to my family!) So, flex some other loving muscles. Be openly affectionate with her. Tell her about your doctor’s advice. (But weirdly, don’t expect that to make a big difference at the table. Old habits die hard.) Sing praises to her cooking, while limiting yourself to reasonable portions. Eat slowly. And help out with the prepping, plating, serving and clearing.

Morally bankrupt and of \"psychopathic ambition,\" as Vincent Canby said in his review in The New York Times, Ms. Christensen was also perfectly attired in pussy-bow blouses, pencil skirts, knee-high boots and heavy camel coats. Her style helped herald the advent of \"power dressing.\" Now, 40 years later, Ms. Christensen and her wardrobe are getting a makeover. The look of the female executive has been redefined on the stage of the National Theater in London, where the Tony Award winner Ivo van Hove is directing Michelle Dockery (\"Downton Abbey\")  as Ms. Christensen in the first stage adaptation, a \"Network\" for the 21st century. The key ingredients this time around, according to the Belgian costume designer An D’Huys, 53, whose 30-year fashion career has spanned television, movies, opera, dance and theater along with 11 years working with the Antwerp designer Ann Demeulemeester Bright, clashing colors, strong lines — and pants. \"The colors show that Diana is not working with the rest of the people and not a team player,\" Ms. D’Huys said. \"It’s not a choice of everyone; it’s her own choice. And a signal that ‘I can wear what I want even if the colors aren’t matching together.’ \" \"I put Diana in pants, oversized blouses and men’s coats,\" she said. \"The most important thing is how a man’s cut can be very feminine and very powerful. The silhouette is more modern, closer fitting.\" Prada’s recent collections, with their pops of orange, green, red and other bright colors, were an inspiration, according to Ms. Huys, who said Miuccia Prada herself was among the women who served as a model of sorts: \"the kind of woman, like Diana, who is personally powerful and rich, not just a business woman.\" It took Ms. D’Huys nine weeks to settle on Ms. Dockery’s final looks; of the 20 costumes initially selected and worn during rehearsal, six outfits made the first preview. They created \"the strongest images of Diana,\" said Ms. D’Huys, who found many of the pieces in vintage shops, including the hip Retro Woman in the Notting Hill area of London, and in the National’s own costume stores to keep the look within budget — and believability. That whittling process helped Ms. Dockery create her character. \"I’ve never done a play before where are you in costumes from the very first day,\" the actress wrote in an email, \"so I was in character from the start.\" Thus platform peep-toe heels were swapped for simple black leather round-toe court shoes from Selfridges, because the first style hurt Ms. Dockery’s feet and \"it’s important to be comfortable to show strength,\" Ms. D’Huys said. Ms. Dockery agreed, adding that the physical demands of playing an executive in today’s media world mean that lower heels are the modern power shoes. \"You can immediately see what works and what doesn’t,\" Ms D’Huys said, adding that a Chloé minidress was too girly (army-inspired though it was). The only scene in which Ms. Dockery does wear a dress — a low-cut, black Diane von Furstenberg wrap with layered satin frills — is in a steamy restaurant moment with her former colleague and soon-to-be lover, Max Schumacher (played by Douglas Henshall). It made sense, Ms. D’Huys said, because \"it is easy to pull up and with one popper easy to open.\" Red, flared trousers from Zara also made the final cut and are central to the character’s new look as \"they are masculine and Diana has to fight in a man’s world,\" Ms. D’Huys said. \"They even help her stand in a more powerful way.\" Along with the flares came assorted silk shirts, including one McQ tie-neck bib-front style that Ms. D’Huys dyed a vivid orange (originally made in cream, the color was too washed-out for Ms. Dockery’s complexion), and a bright purple from Diane von Furstenberg. Military-style coats play a significant role, including a belted beige trench with capelike shoulders, and a double-breasted Burberry wool with epaulets and leather detailing on the sleeves. \"Everything is loose fitting and not too styled, so Diana is relaxed,\" wrote Ms. Dockery, noting that not-trying-too-hard was the essence of her character’s look. As Ms. Christensen’s power fluctuates through the play, so does the vibrancy of her clothes. She makes her entrance in a neutral tobacco-colored honeycomb-print blouse, for example, but dons a luminous yellow shirt when she believes she has hit the ratings jackpot when her increasingly unmoored anchorman Howard Beale (played by Bryan Cranston) delivers his famous live broadcast announcing he is \"mad as hell\" and can’t take it any more. Later, as her personal and professional lives go awry (her lover leaves and ratings plummet), more subtle, smudged colors appear in the form of dark green, wide-leg pants bought online from Theory a week before the first preview. \"I wanted another color for the ending as everything goes down,\" Ms. D’Huys said. What Ms. Christensen never has: \"It\" bags or other logo-laden accessories. As to why, well, Ms. D’Huys said, \"most of the people I have met who are very important and powerful don’t show labels.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/style/network-michelle-dockery-power-dressing.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Confirm or Deny: Anne Wojcicki', 'text': ' Maureen Dowd: Google has too much power.

Its headline was simple enough: \"Fierstein’s ‘Torch Song.’\" But what followed was anything but. \"Arnold Beckoff, the lonely but far-from-forlorn hero of Harvey Fierstein’s ‘Torch Song Trilogy,’ is a die-hard romantic who takes his heart, soul and fatalism from the 1920s ballads that give the work its title and its tone,\" the critic Mel Gussow wrote. \"At the end of a long, infinitely rewarding evening in the company of Arnold and his family and friends, he confesses with a sigh that he has always wanted exactly the life that his mother has had — ‘with certain minor alterations.’ \"Those alterations — Arnold is a homosexual and a professional ‘drag queen’ — are the substance but not the sum of Mr. Fierstein’s work, three plays that give us a progressively dramatic and illuminating portrait of a man who laughs, and makes us laugh, to keep from collapsing.\" I immediately called my best friend, Barry, who lived two blocks north of me, and got his answering machine. \"The Times,\" I said. \"Page 81. I’m getting two tickets. Call me back.\" Barry and I were theater geeks, and had been since the day we had separately moved to New York two years earlier: Cutting out of work early to stand in line for tickets to Shakespeare in the Park, getting rush tickets at the Public Theater, spending our Saturdays at the TKTS booth in Times Square, occasionally second-acting Broadway shows that we couldn’t afford a ticket to. But this play sounded like something we had never seen before. A few days later, we headed over to the Richard Allen Center on West 62nd Street and mounted six narrow flights of stairs, to confront a stage no bigger than my living room, and entered a cramped theater filled with others who had heard the same siren call. Previously my only experiences of gay theater had been plays like \"The Boys in the Band,\" \"Fortune and Men’s Eyes,\" \"Tea and Sympathy\" and \"Streamers\" — plays where the gay character was either closeted or bitter or suicidal, and usually all three. It was a shock to see Mr. Fierstein, as Arnold, strutting around his apartment in his floppy rabbit slippers, cracking jokes, sharing affection with both his lover and his foster son, and going ferociously head-to-head with his disapproving mother, played by Estelle Getty, then unknown. A play in which the gay character was smart, funny and fully alive? A revelation. A couple of years later, after \"Torch Song\" had transferred to Broadway, Barry and I were in my cramped living room on a Sunday night in June, sitting on the floor and watching the Tony Awards. When Mr. Fierstein was announced as best actor, we screamed with joy and surprise, doing so again when \"Torch Song\" was unexpectedly named best play, beating out Marsha Norman’s \"’Night, Mother\" and David Hare’s \"Plenty.\" Mr. Fierstein was funny in both acceptance speeches, but I could hear the room grow quiet when John Glines, one of the producers, stood in front of the microphone. He gripped his Tony with a visibly shaking right hand and ended his speech by saying he wanted to thank the \"one person who believed in and followed the dream from the very beginning, who never said, ‘You’re crazy, it can’t be done.’ And I refer to my partner and my lover, Lawrence Lane.\" We were shocked. It was the first time either of us had seen a real-life gay man openly acknowledge a romantic relationship on network TV, much less on an awards program. Fast-forward to 2017 and the first New York revival of \"Torch Song\" since the original production closed on Broadway in May 1985. Shortly before its official opening at Second Stage Theater, I talked to Moisés Kaufman, the writer/director of \"Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde\" and \"The Laramie Project\" and now the director of that revival (playing through Dec. 9). He told me that, for him as well, seeing \"Torch Song\" as a young man (a road-company production in San Francisco in 1985) had been a life-altering experience. \"I was in my 20s and had never seen a play with a gay character before, none,\" he said. \"I hadn’t seen ‘Boys in the Band’ — luckily, I think, because it is such a depressing narrative about us — and so seeing all these gay men on stage, a door opened for me. I thought, ‘Well, my life might be possible.’\" He added, \"It was thrilling on so many layers. Not just because it showed me someone I could aspire to be, but also re-emphasized for me personally that the stage was a place where great revelations can take place. It made me feel, ‘Yes, there is a life of a gay man but also there is life for me in the theater.’\" Mr. Fierstein, the playwright, has long acknowledged how important that original production of \"Torch Song\" had been for gay men of his generation. And he, too, recognized what a departure it was from the gay-themed plays he had both seen and acted in as a young man. \"I had done some of those plays,\" he told me recently backstage at the Second Stage Theater on West 43rd Street. \"I did Lanford Wilson’s ‘The Madness of Lady Bright,’ Robert Patrick’s ‘The Haunted Coast.’ I designed a production of ‘Staircase.’ I had friends in ‘Fortune and Men’s Eyes.’ I even saw a play called ‘The Elocution of Benjamin’ in which a fat man comes out on stage, fully naked, and talks about being in love with young boys.\" But, he said, even given those precedents, \"Torch Song\" was not as revolutionary as others made it out to be. The family life that Arnold so yearned for? Mr. Fierstein said he witnessed it every day when was in his 20s and living in Brooklyn. \"The very first gay people I knew were Bruce Wyatt and Bud Sherman, who ran this community theater in Park Slope, where I lived at the time, and they had been together for 30-some-odd years,\" Mr. Fierstein told me. \"They had a great life. I didn’t know until I took the subway into Manhattan that we as gay people were supposed to be unhappy. I didn’t know it until I saw things like ‘Boys in the Band’ that we were supposed to be miserable, that we were supposed to be suicidal, that we were supposed to be self-hating. All the gay people I knew were having a very good time!\" Of course, over the years, more gay-themed plays would be written and produced on Broadway, some, like \"As Is,\" \"Angels in America\" and \"Falsettos,\" dealing forthrightly with the plague of AIDS. And gay characters are now woven deftly into the narratives of plays that, nominally at least, are not about the gay experience, like \"Come From Away\" or \"The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.\" Everything has changed. A few weeks ago, when I went to see the Second Stage revival, starring Michael Urie as Arnold and Mercedes Ruehl as his mother, I did so with trepidation. Would it hold up, three decades later, or seem a curious theatrical artifact, perhaps best left to the memory bin? Not to worry. I still laughed, as did the sold-out audience around me, at the comically mimed scenes of back-room sex; still shed a tear at the telling of a young character’s death at the hands of some gay bashers; still flinched at the moment when Arnold’s mother tells him that if she had known he would turn out gay, she would have terminated her pregnancy. My only regret? That my friend Barry wasn’t again in the seat next to me. He died of AIDS almost seven years to the day after that Sunday morning phone call, telling him there was a play we had to go see.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/style/torch-song-trilogy-and-me-a-35-year-love-affair.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'weddings': [{'title': '‘Two Weird Stories’ Meet on Match.com', 'text': ' The sprawling home of Candice Marie Turner and Brian James Lee is so busy and lively, and the couple so welcoming, that there’s a sense a stranger could move in without anyone really noticing. At various times, their six-bedroom house in White Plains, N.Y., has absorbed family members, friends, friends of friends and children of friends who needed a place to stay. A large dog and a cat, both adopted from shelters, currently roam the rooms as well. \"I love having lots of people around,\" said Ms. Turner, 45. \"I love the chaos.\" Jennifer Gardner, Ms. Turner’s younger sister, moved in for a while with her son and daughter, as did another sister, Christian Faith Turner Barnes, and her 18-month-old son. \"We joked we had to tell the neighbors we weren’t polygamous because there were so many of us — teenagers, a couple of women, a baby here and there, and Brian,\" Ms. Gardner said. Ms. Turner and Mr. Lee, who were married last month in Manhattan, were leading very different lives just six years ago. Ms. Turner, a tax lawyer, was a divorced single mother living in a small apartment on the Upper East Side with her adopted son, Matthew Bambino Turner, who is now 17 and has cerebral palsy. When Matthew was a baby, she had offered to help his overwhelmed birth mother, the sister of a friend, take care of him. \"I thought, ‘This kid needs a mom so I’m going to be his mother,’ \" Ms. Turner said. \"If his birth mother takes him back, that’s fine. I’ve just got to be all in.\" In 2002, she adopted him. Ms. Turner describes herself as a \"Type A-plus\" math nerd from an unconventional family. She grew up in Memphis but spent a lot of time traveling with her parents, who worked for carnivals. Her mother, Debby Willis, sold tickets and sometimes filled in for the Snake Lady act, while her father, Edsel Wesley Turner, was a welder who operated the rides. Ms. Turner took naps on the merry-go-round. Growing up a \"carny brat,\" she developed a love of crowds and learned, as she put it, \"to accept everyone as they are and leave no one behind.\" Her New York apartment generally had a carnival-like atmosphere. \"She’s a person who believes in the spirit of community,\" said Jessica Baker, a friend. \"I never thought of Candice as alone in Manhattan. It was Candice and Matthew and her 12 best friends and their children.\" Over the years, Ms. Turner dated sporadically, but halfheartedly. In 2011, she made a New Year’s resolution: This would be the year she found a serious boyfriend. She already had a profile on Match.com, but planned to be pickier about the men she met. \"I didn’t want to mess around with all these casual guys,\" she said. In early March 2011, Mr. Lee contacted her through the website. Now 47, he grew up in Waterford, Vt., a tiny town made up of old houses and dirt roads, two things he still loves. Idiosyncratic and thoughtful, Mr. Lee is a runner and a rock ’n’ roll fan who studied English at the University of Vermont, earned a master’s degree in education at Fordham University and now teaches literature at Ridgewood High School in Ridgewood, N.J. During one of their first online conversations, Ms. Turner, who graduated from the University of Alabama and New York University School of Law, asked him: \"Do you have any children?\" He typed back, \"It’s complicated.\" It turned out Mr. Lee was also a single divorced parent living with an adopted child, Christina Lee, who was 14 at the time. In 1998, Mr. Lee and his first wife became foster parents to Christina. \"She was a temporary emergency placement,\" he said. After Mr. Lee got divorced in 2001, he adopted Christina and the two eventually settled into an apartment in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J. \"What was my life like?\" he said. \"Solitary and hectic.\" Every night, they would read books together and every summer, they drove up to New Hampshire to spend a month with his family. \"I like to take the back roads, the slow way,\" he said. \"We’d play music the whole way up.\" He rarely dated or went out at night, mostly because he was too busy cooking dinner and grading papers. Once Christina got older, she would often say, \"We need a woman around here!\" On March 12, 2011, Mr. Lee and Ms. Turner met for their first date at Blue Smoke, a barbecue place in Manhattan. It was not love at first sight, but it wasn’t a disaster either. For their second date, they got together for Sunday brunch, hours after Ms. Turner had completed the New York City half marathon, which impressed Mr. Lee. She arrived limping yet talkative. Their third date changed everything. She invited him to a University of Alabama basketball game on a Tuesday night and he broke his longstanding rule of never going out on school nights. \"We met at Madison Square Garden,\" she said. \"He was standing on the steps and he turned around and it was like one of those moments in the movies. I was in love.\" They kissed throughout the game. \"We had a mushy goodbye,\" he recalled. \" ‘I like us,’ I said. Later, I thought to myself, ‘Maybe I shouldn’t have said that.’ \" Over the next few months, they got together for all kinds of activities, from academic to goofy. They went hiking; watched a Shakespeare play; played miniature golf. \"She might be a high-powered tax lawyer, but at the same time, she’s a very down-to-earth Southern gal,\" he said. Ms. Turner, who now works in New York City as a principal of KPMG, the accounting firm, said, \"He was smart and he’s funny. One thing I really love about Brian is he has a great way of making fun of me without being hurtful. The kindness shows at the same time.\" That summer, with school out and Christina away on a trip, Mr. Lee started spending more and more time in the city with Ms. Turner. One day, she said they needed to talk. \"I told him, ‘I have two things I want to tell you,’ \" she said. \" ‘Well, I got you this dresser and I’m concerned you might think that’s too much commitment.’ Then, I was like, ‘Oh, and I’m pregnant.’ \" They had never discussed having children together, but each had always wanted bigger families. Describing his reaction, Mr. Lee said, \"I just felt almost peaceful about it and happy and excited.\" Ms. Turner said, \"It wasn’t like, ‘Oh, what are we going to do?’ It was, ‘This is going to be fine, however it shakes out.’\" Joey Lee Turner was born in 2012 and they soon moved into their White Plains house, which was built around 1910 and is known as Little Farm. A second son, Bean Lee Turner, was born in 2013, and another, Theo Lee Turner, in 2015. Ms. Turner approached new motherhood with conviction. \"She breast-fed all three of our boys, pumping in her office with a hospital-grade pump, filling up the freezer with a storehouse of breast milk,\" Mr. Lee said, with awe. Part of the reason they work so well together, both said, is that they are so different. She will be in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on a business trip while he’s at home playing Name That Tune with the children. She’s a multitasker; he’s the opposite. \"I can be almost too lackadaisical and laid-back,\" he said. \"Like this summer, I had a list of things to do — get the screens fixed, get the masonry done, permit for the tent, pets to the vet. I got one thing done right away and then I could never get anything else off the list.\" Before their wedding on Oct. 14, he did manage to complete the chores. \"I was so excited to cross everything off the list,\" Mr. Lee said. \"Then, I lost the list.\" Hearing this, Ms. Turner guffawed. Their afternoon wedding took place in Manhattan at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola and began with Joey, Bean and Theo wandering down the aisle, all appearing approximately the same size. Speaking to the crowd of 200 guests, the officiant, the Rev. Dennis J. Yesalonia, a Roman Catholic priest, described the couple as \"two weird stories on Match.com.\" He went on to say the bride’s adoption of Matthew was \"an exquisite story of love,\" while the groom’s adoption of Christina was \"a courageous move, a young father alone.\" Loneliness is no longer a problem. A raucous reception was held in the couple’s backyard, where carnival games were set up for the children. As it got dark, the house glowed like an enormous jack-o’-lantern.

Who Tom Kirdahy, 54, and Terrence McNally, 78. Occupations Mr. Kirdahy is a theater producer and lawyer; Mr. McNally is a Tony Award-winning playwright. Their Marriage 13 years, 11 months and counting. When Tom Kirdahy met Terrence McNally in June 2001 at Guild Hall in East Hampton, N.Y., something ignited in both men. \"When I first saw him, I thought he was completely adorable,\" said Mr. Kirdahy, who was producing a panel discussion, \"Theater From a Gay Perspective,\" organized by the East End Gay Organization. \"It sounds cliché, but his eyes just smiled. I can’t say it was love at first sight, but I knew I wanted to get to know him more.\" Mr. McNally spoke similarly. \"I was immediately struck by him,\" he said. \"It was mystical, emotional and spiritual. I thought, ‘This guy is really special, I like him.’\" During the panel, which included Edward Albee and Lanford Wilson, the two shared a laugh. Then an intentional look. \"Towards the end of the evening a dear friend told me, ‘You’re going to end up with him,’ \" Mr. Kirdahy said. She was right. The pair have been together since. They took part in a civil union ceremony Dec. 20, 2003, in Vermont at the Inn at Saw Farm in West Dover. They have lived in the East Village of Manhattan for 15 years. Mr. Kirdahy \"In the 16 years that we’ve been together, this August was the first time I was in a foreign city I’d never been to before without him. I found myself craving and missing him. I had no idea I could ever feel that about another person. But knowing I had this partner to come home to was overwhelming. Terrence was diagnosed with lung cancer shortly after we met, and I had done AIDS work for two decades and was ravaged by loss. My husband’s health and well-being has become the most important thing to me. I’m not sure I knew I was capable of that feeling prior to this relationship. I learned that the words ‘Till death do us part’ meant more to me than I ever thought they could. That love can be that intense. The commitment to another person’s well-being has been the greatest honor. I knew I could bring all of my experience to help him navigate the frightening world of fighting for your life, which all felt so purposeful to me, and that was part of our falling in love. I love the feeling of having committed to someone, ‘In sickness and in health.’ Terrence is cancer free and very healthy today, and that means everything to me. I didn’t know I was capable of loving someone so deeply. That I would ever get to experience that feeling. I’ve learned that it’s real. That the intensity and longevity and joy of love are real.\" Mr. McNally \"I do believe in love at first sight. It just seemed right from the very beginning. I had lost a partner from AIDS the year before. I was 63 at the time and didn’t expect to meet someone again. We’ve spent almost every night together since. The freedom to marry has changed the playing field for gay men and women. Before, the relationships were between ourselves. We didn’t have rights. Having the legal support from the government has made a difference. I didn’t realize how much we’d been missing by not having it. To marry Tom was a great moment in my life. I’ve learned how blessed I am to be with the right partner. He’s very much a part of who I am. We don’t take each other for granted. I earn Tom’s trust and affection, and he earns mine. I don’t think of myself without thinking about him, and that completes me. I learn from him every day. I’ve seen compassion and kindness in him. I’ve learned about being less selfish. He’s a good man and he’s made me a better person. That’s thrilling to be learning at this age. I knew Tom was the person I needed and knew I had to be with. A lot of people said they loved me, but they didn’t love me the way I needed to be loved. He makes me feel safe — that’s a big thing to say — and I pray he feels the same from me. You read about happy tears and I understand them now.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/fashion/weddings/tom-kirdahy-and-terrence-mcnally-an-immediate-and-lasting-need.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Tynishia Williams, Thomas Powell III', 'text': ' Tynishia Chloe Williams and Thomas Francis Robert Powell III were married Nov. 18 in a Quaker ceremony at the Alfred B.

A week earlier she had run the New York City Marathon and at that point qualified for the Boston Marathon 15 consecutive times (to date, 19 times). \"It was more of a social thing,\" she said of squash, as was the emphasis of the tournament. \"I was just hoping nobody was watching me play.’’ Mr. Uprichard, a founder of the squash tournament and a ranked squash player, approached her during a cocktail event at the Ascot restaurant in Bermuda. \"I pretty much monopolized her evening,\" said Mr. Uprichard, who treated her to a Kir Royale, a Champagne drink with crème de cassis, even after finding out it was a jaw-dropping $40 a glass. Ms. Withington said she enjoyed listening to his \"cute Scottish accent\" as he charmed her with tales of growing up in the French Congo, Zambia and other parts of Africa. \"You don’t meet a lot of guys who tell you about a pet monkey they grew up with in Zambia,\" she said. They appreciated each others athleticism and competitiveness. He was also a runner, though on a much more recreational basis, and they learned they had run some of the same races over the last 20 years, including the Scotland Run that April in New York. After the trip to Bermuda, they sent each other flirty texts from time to time. They also met on a few occasions, including at the Yale Club in spring 2015 for a game of squash and at a party at her house in Connecticut, where she has a squash court. They returned to the Bermuda squash tournament in November 2015; they were inseparable, though still not dating. In January 2016, Mr. Uprichard said he finally \"puffed up his chest\" when she told him she would be going to a gala alone hosted by the New York Flyers, her running club. \"We can’t have that,\" he said, \" I should accompany you.\" Not only did she receive the Master Runner of the Year award for the third year in a row, that evening they also had their first kiss. When he went to her house within the next couple of weeks to play squash, he could not help but notice a list of 10 requirements regarding boyfriends taped to her refrigerator. \"I had forgotten to take the list down,\" said Ms. Withington, explaining that it was drawn up by her two daughters a couple of years earlier. \"Plays squash,\" \"no smoking\" and \"nice with Mama,\" were easily satisfied, but \"nice with kids\" was put to the test two months later when he met the girls. Her older daughter, Alex, immediately opened up a Harvard medical book to baldness, and asked what kind of baldness he had, while her other daughter, Mandy, patted his bald head. \"He was a good sport about it,\" said Ms. Withington, with a laugh. \"Now he’s checked all the boxes.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/fashion/weddings/a-good-sport-on-and-off-the-squash-court.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Rebecca Kaplan, Adam Levy', 'text': ' Rebecca Rachele Kaplan and Adam Philip Levy were married Nov. 18 at the W Hotel Washington.

Is it possible that a trillion of those trees have deposited their leaves in the front yard? And why are so many of them still green? That global tree census comes from a 2015 study in the journal Nature. And reading its methodology in full — biome-level validation estimates! predictive regression models! — would be a perfectly good way to put off the job of going out to the garage, grabbing a rake and getting to work on a few of those leaves. Gardening in November: Why bother? And haven’t we already missed our chance? In 2016, the first freeze sauntered into New York on Dec. 9. This year, it crashed the harvest festival a full month earlier. And 2018 — so we’re assuming the Earth will continue spinning on its axis? We’re a nation of gamblers. The garden tool to battle indeterminacy, however, turns out to be routine. Were you to call a half-dozen super-gardeners around the metro area and ask for their fall cleanup regime, you’d come away with an authoritative to-do list. What seems at first like an undifferentiated pile of drudgery can, in fact, be divided into three categories: tasks that need doing for the health and hygiene of the garden; tasks that could be done to tidy up the place; and tasks that a more organized, more ambitious and generally better person would do to create a thriving garden next spring. But wait, there’s a fourth category, the refuge of idlers — and also, as it happens, backyard ecologists. We’ll save that option for the end. Life and limb: Let’s start there. Annie Novak, 34, who raises produce at Eagle Street Rooftop Farm, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, has a cautionary message for the patio and balcony gardeners of New York: \"It’s a hazard to have a lightweight container system on your roof.\" Once you pull the tomato vines out of a planter and stop watering, what remains on the roof is a projectile. \"If you can lift something up,\" Ms. Novak warned, \"so can the wind.\" Keeping the growing material in place is the next concern, and this applies to any container planting. Ms. Novak’s main crops — calendula and chili peppers — start to flag each fall after temperatures drop below 40 degrees. Before then, she will have started to sow cover crops, like clover and vetch, to hold onto the growing medium, a specialized mix of particulate clay and shale, mixed with organic matter. A cover crop will also help fix nitrogen — that is, feed the soil for spring planting. Look up. Once the leaves have base-jumped off their branches, you can start to see the dead limbs they were concealing. Urban forestry researchers estimate that an ice storm can multiply the weight of a tree limb by a factor of 10 to 100. And the canopies on some common tree species — hackberries, willows, Bradford pears, jack pines — may render them more vulnerable to limb loss. The takeaway: Fall represents an unimpeachable time to make an appointment with an arborist and a pruning crew. RUST NEVER SLEEPS Splitting, cracking, rotting, rusting. If winter kept its own chore list, various forms of decay would represent items one through four. Shobha Vanchiswar performs yeoman’s work to limit the damage from freezing and melting in the quarter-acre of gardens surrounding her 1915 colonial in Chappaqua, N.Y. Well before the meteorologists start hyperventilating about first frost, she evacuates her tender potted perennials to a small greenhouse. A few bay standards, some boxwoods, a Meyer lemon, a hibiscus — squeezing them all in there generally takes a little pruning first. Once the plants are safe, Ms. Vanchiswar rescues the tools. Empty terra-cotta pots get a pressure wash and an escort to the garage. Trowels and spades she dunks in a bucket of sand, with a little motor oil mixed in for lubrication. (Isn’t that the central contradiction of winter: How can it simultaneously be so damp and so dry?) Ms. Vanchiswar began her career in molecular biology, and she addresses the garden in fall with a scientific rigor and exactitude. The way to get rid of weeds in the lawn? Deposit three inches of compost in October and November and reseed the turf. How to preserve the climbing roses? Wrap them in a single layer of burlap. But late fall also allows Ms. Vanchiswar to indulge her later career as a garden designer and artist. \"In winter,\" she said, \"it’s more about the architecture and the light effects in the garden.\" Some of her cut perennials — joe-pye weed, golden rod, sedums, asters — go into bundles that she brings to a watercolor class at the Art Students League of New York. \"All winter long it will be in the still-life arrangement,\" Ms. Vanchiswar said of her cuttings. The fall garden here becomes not a chore but an opportunity: If you can’t grow it, paint it. SPRING IS ONLY 120 DAYS AWAY The New York garden will, inexorably, die back over the winter. (Aspiring year-round gardeners may want to look at property in the temperate outer borough known as Florida.) When you’re cleaning up the yard in fall, you’re betting on next spring. Patti Kraemer-Doell, 49, spends the fall shutting down both her home garden and her floral events business and CSA, called Little Big Farm, in the northwest corner of New Jersey. That means digging up hundreds of dahlia tubers to store in a 40-degree fridge and then replant next May. Annuals? Ms. Kraemer-Doell yanks them out of the ground for the compost heap: ageratum, gomphrena (that is, globe amaranth), zinnias, sunflowers. Perennials? These she divides with a sharp spade: ornamental grasses, sedum, rudbeckia, echinacea. On a leisurely day, you can wet down the plant, lop off the dead stalks a few inches above the ground and then dig up the whole root ball. Pull apart the tangled roots with a garden fork. (Just imagine your kindergartner has come home with bubble gum in her hair.) Next, return part of the perennial clump to its home, while spreading the satellites to new sites. If it’s chilly out, and you’ve got a mild case of consumption, cleave a hunk of root, toss it in a new hole and give your new pal a drink. It’s quitting time for both of you. These perennials are tougher than you would think, Ms. Kraemer-Doell said. And fall is, counterintuitively, a good time for plant shopping. If the ground isn’t frozen yet, what do you have to lose? \"If you go to Lowe’s and Home Depot, and it’s a buck and it’s still alive?\" she said. \"I’ll buy that.\" Baptisia, roses — why not? Chop up your leaves with a mower and blow them over the beds for insulation. Think of it not as a blowing mess, but as a mobile compost pile. Will the plants bloom next summer? Is it possible in winter to have too many things to look forward to? Here’s a plant that definitely won’t flower: the hydrangea that someone prunes a little too punitively in the fall. Jason Austin, a gardener and horticulturist in Pine Beach, N.J., wishes more of us would think about our goals before wielding a set of pruners or loppers. But dead twigs, branches that cross each other close to the trunk (picture how your arms would appear if you turned a steering wheel without letting go): Not a good look for a tree. Go to town on this stuff. Still, this is not a license to treat your woody charges like a patient on the amputation table in \"The Knick.\" \"People have to recognize,\" Mr. Austin said, \"you’re pruning branches that could be holding next year’s flowers.\" WE’RE NOT BEING SLOVENLY; WE’RE PRESERVING A MOTH HABITAT What if you did nothing at all? Call it the Sloth Option. As Carol Capobianco, the director of the Native Plant Center at Westchester Community College, in Valhalla, N.Y., explained in an email, \"We encourage people not to put their garden to bed in winter.\" The circle of life doesn’t work as well with a winter-shaped wedge cut out of it. In her book, \"The Humane Gardener\" (published by Princeton Architectural Press in April), Nancy Lawson promotes gardening to create habitat for wildlife. That means leaving the seed heads flopping on meadow plants like boneset, joe-pye weed, ironweed and woodland sunflowers. The messy area below these plants will become shelter to wood frogs that overwinter in place. Swallowtails will camp out in the dry stalks. \"A few years ago, I set out to figure out what I like about winter,\" Ms. Lawson said. \"And to try to force myself to be at peace with the cold and the brown. I realized it’s so life-giving to other species. They have to be outside all the time. I get to be inside under a blanket by the fireplace.\" By the end of October, for instance, queen bumblebees have burrowed into the leaf litter to ride out the winter. \"In spring, they’re the only ones left of their colony,\" Ms. Lawson said. \"And they start a new colony by themselves.\" Doesn’t she worry that a blanket of unraked leaves will smother the lawn? No, she counts on it. \"Right now, it’s a great time!\" she said of her ongoing campaign to exterminate the lawn. For more than a decade, Ms. Lawson has been trying to spread a wild meadow to replace the turf grass that originally encircled her 1970s home outside Baltimore, Md. This year’s green leaves may help: In some scientific studies, the moister, green ones appeared to decompose faster than the dryer, brown ones. Love your lawn? Move the leaves to an inconspicuous corner of the yard and forget about them for a good long while. When you remember the mountain again — and you can actually feel the sun on your face — spread the stuff around the flower beds. \"Leaf mold\" — alleged scourge of the unraked yard — ought to hire one of those reputation consultants. When the leaves are wet, Ms. Lawson said, \"they’re not going to blow away.\" Stacked over newspaper and cardboard, the leaf litter will decay into rich soil for spring. It’s not leaves now, but mulch. \"It might look a little like death,\" she said, \"but it smells like life.\" As a garden designer, Ms. Lawson can finally stop thinking about the composition of plant colors, textures and heights. It’s fall: time to let decomposition take over.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/realestate/putting-garden-to-bed.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '', 'text': '', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/realestate/multigenerational-households-already-home-for-the-holidays.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'What to Do When a Neighbor Is Taking Your Newspaper', 'text': ' Q. A neighbor in my Manhattan co-op has occasionally been taking my newspaper or another neighbor’s newspapers from our doormats. When I inquired, management said it was a shareholder issue and would not get involved. Is this true? Or is there something that management could do? A. The newspaper presumably has your name and address affixed to it, meaning it is your property and not some expendable flyer like a takeout menu. And another shareholder’s possessions have gone missing, too, making this a larger issue — and one that management should address. \"What’s it going to take for this building to get involved?\" said Steven D. Sladkus, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. \"For them to take the doormat, too?\" The neighbor’s behavior could be considered objectionable conduct and could violate house rules. Management should do what it can to prevent theft, as the situation could escalate. Who’s to say Fresh Direct deliveries won’t go missing next? \"If we are permitting deliveries in the building, we should be responsible for making sure people get what is delivered to them,\" said Daniel Wollman, the chief executive of Gumley Haft Real Estate Management. The board could write a letter to all the shareholders reminding everyone that newspapers are not collective property and should be left alone. It could also install hallway cameras as a deterrent and to collect evidence. Write the board and managing agent another letter, insisting that they take action. Ask the other affected neighbor to sign the letter, too, as two voices are usually stronger than one. Ask management to provide you with an alternative delivery location. Perhaps the papers could be left with a doorman or with the superintendent. Or, find out if you could place a basket atop your doormat, which might serve as a deterrent. \"The perpetrator will be less likely to pinch the paper if he or she has to dig into a container,\" said Nancy R. Mitchell, the author of \"Etiquette Rules! A Field Guide to Modern Manners.\" You could write a letter to the culprit (assuming you are certain who it is). Point out that private property is being stolen and your sense of community has been shaken. Remind the neighbor that these subscriptions are neither cheap nor free. Perhaps the neighbor will do the right thing and start respecting other people’s property.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/realestate/what-to-do-when-a-neighbor-is-taking-your-newspaper.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Homes for Sale in New York City', 'text': ' Click on the slide show to see this week’s featured properties in New York City: • In Dumbo, Brooklyn, a loft condo with two sleeping areas and two baths on the sixth floor of a converted 1915 soap factory, with an open kitchen, office/nursery, central air conditioning and a washer and dryer. • In Lincoln Square, a two-bedroom, two-bath ground-floor apartment with charming prewar details and a private garden that gives the space a bed-and-breakfast feel. • In Midtown East, a lofted studio with nearly 12-foot ceilings, new oak floors and a private balcony in a 26-story prewar condop', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/realestate/homes-for-sale-dumbo-brooklyn-lincoln-square-and-midtown-east.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Homes for Sale in New York and Connecticut', 'text': ' Click on the slide show to see this week’s featured properties in New York and New Jersey: • In Redding, Conn., a three-bedroom, three-bath renovated home with white oak floors, a new kitchen, living room with free-standing gas fireplace, third-level bonus room and a lower-level family room. • In Great Neck, N.Y., a five-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath 1928 renovated Tudor with a cedar closet, a separate upstairs guest suite, a finished basement and a two-car attached garage.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/realestate/homes-for-sale-in-great-neck-new-york-and-redding-connecticut.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Searching for Sunlight in the City', 'text': ' A year ago, when Frederik Fredsted Christiansen was sent from his native Copenhagen to New York for work, his company set him up above one of its stores. Mr. Christiansen, 29, is president of United States operations for Joe & The Juice, a Danish chain serving coffee, smoothies and sandwiches, and he oversees the company’s 23 retail stores here, 13 of them — soon to be 16 — in New York. His tiny studio on Prince Street had two windows and was hot in the summer and cold in the winter. Also, \"there was a wall two meters from the window,\" he said, \"so there was no sunlight.\" In Copenhagen, \"we have big apartments for reasonable money, and we have windows where sunlight is coming in,\" said Mr. Christiansen, who at one point managed his company’s largest store, at Copenhagen Airport. \"It was really weird for me,\" he added, that \"I never saw the sun.\" He was surprised, too, by how old-fashioned some things were in New York. To pay his rent, for example, he had to write a check, whereas in Denmark, he said, \"you pay everything on the internet or transfer via your bank on your mobile app.\" For six months, the company paid Mr. Christiansen’s monthly rent of $2,300. Once he assumed the payments, he became increasingly eager to move. With a budget of about $3,000 a month — and sunlight his primary requirement — he began looking for an apartment somewhere around Midtown. In early summer, using StreetEasy, he found a newly renovated one-bedroom with a private roof deck in Hell’s Kitchen, for $3,000 a month. He was ready to sign on. Then the agent asked if he had credit. Mr. Christiansen didn’t know what that was. \"It hit me that this is going to be harder than I thought,\" he said. He had a debit card, but as a newcomer, no credit history in the United States. \"It doesn’t matter how much money you have in your account,\" he said. \"If you don’t have credit, you can’t get the apartment.\" Still, he told himself, \"it’s impossible it’s like that everywhere,\" and continued his search. He soon found a large studio with an even larger terrace in a 2009 boutique condo building in Midtown. The terrace, however, was in the shadow of surrounding buildings. And because of the placement of the apartment’s doors, windows and kitchen, there was little wall space. A narrow hallway, described as a dressing area, seemed useless. It was easy to pass on the apartment, which was $2,500 a month. Next, Mr. Christiansen found the website for a new building in Hell’s Kitchen, 525 West 52nd Street. He informed the leasing associate, Andrés Pellot-Ramos, of his desire for natural light, and Mr. Pellot-Ramos showed him three studios. The view from the first two, on lower floors, was partly blocked, but the third unit was higher up. \"He planned it,\" Mr. Christiansen said. \"Suddenly, I could see the whole city, and I knew right away.\" He also knew that in a brand-new building he wouldn’t have to worry about the heat, the cold or anything else. \"I said, ‘I am going to take this,’\" Mr. Christiansen recalled. \"And Andrés said, ‘Do you have credit?’\" Since he did not, the building connected him with TheGuarantors, a service that guarantees leases for renters who don’t meet rental requirements, like having a United States credit history or an annual income that meets the building’s requirement (in this building, 40 times the monthly rent). The company has a sliding fee scale, but typically charges around 80 percent of a month’s rent. \"I really wanted this apartment and was scared it would slip through my fingers,\" Mr. Christiansen said. He was relieved to be approved quickly by TheGuarantors. Mr. Christiansen’s rent is now $3,390 a month, and he received three months free on a two-year lease. (The building is currently offering two months free on a 14-month lease.) He arrived in the summer, bought new furniture and adopted a dog, Vera. \"I am going to stay here for a long time, and it is time to make it feel like a home,\" he said. He has plenty of closet space and a stacked washer-dryer. During his first few weeks, he said, he was awakened by heavy construction at 7 a.m., but now it is not as early or as loud, though work continues on the building’s interior. Cellphone reception is spotty, he said, but apart from that, \"everything works\" in the building. And he doesn’t have to write a rent check — tenants have the option of paying online with ClickPay. One building amenity, a screening room, was especially welcome. \"I take my computer to the cinema screen and watch my little brother play on Danish television,\" said Mr. Christiansen, whose brother is a professional soccer player. \"It is like being in the stadium myself.\" He is used to luxuries like that in hotels, he said, \"but not in buildings where normal people live.\" Best of all, he keeps his blinds open at night and awakens to the sunrise. \"It’s nice to walk around an apartment where you don’t have to have your lamps on all the time,\" he said. \"It makes you happier.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/realestate/searching-for-sunlight-in-the-city.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Perth Amboy, N.J.: Historic Buildings and Affordable Housing', 'text': ' Shortly into the new millennium, the future looked hopeful for Perth Amboy, N.J., a city on Raritan Bay a skipping stone’s throw from Staten Island. As part of a larger revitalization plan, the town’s mayor at the time, Joseph Vas, promised a $600 million development at the water’s edge, with 2,200 housing units, shops, a hotel and high-speed ferry service to New York. But then the economy tanked. The developer, Kushner Companies, constructed only two buildings, with fewer than 200 housing units altogether. And the mayor, Mr. Vas, was convicted on unrelated corruption charges. Then came Hurricane Sandy. The persistence of foreclosures testifies that Perth Amboy is still recovering from the recession, and vacant lots near the waterfront bear signs of ongoing work to clean up land tainted by heavy industry. Last year, Perth Amboy was ranked as one of the 15 poorest cities in New Jersey, with 24.4 percent of residents living below the poverty line. But community leaders, real estate operators and residents point to the 4.5-square-mile city’s recent improvements and big potential. In addition to the repaired waterfront where public recreational areas and commercial warehouses continue to be developed, its resources include a richly textured history dating to Colonial times, a train station with direct service to Manhattan, and affordable housing that gives people with midlevel incomes a good quality of life. Caroline Pozycki-Torres, the founder of a nonprofit that organizes local cultural events, moved to Perth Amboy in 2006, and in 2010 paid $250,000 for a 1,700-square-foot condominium in an 1890 house on Water Street, near the bay. A former chair of the municipal arts council, she has introduced to the city a waterfront arts festival, moonrise concerts, a pop-up cinema and a public mural project. Ms. Pozycki-Torres described her life among sailboats and sea breezes as a rare gift. \"I’ve worked in nonprofits all my life, and my husband is a musician,\" she said, noting that Perth Amboy is attracting an increasing number of artists. Also well situated is Alan Silber. In 1987, he and his wife, Sonia, paid $135,000 for an 82-year-old, three-bedroom house on Rector Street near the waterfront, which he said is worth about $220,000 today. But Mr. Silber, a retired distribution manager, emphasized that the area, with its endearing Victorian houses, is only one part of the town, and in some ways its own country. \"This is how we sell Perth Amboy,\" he said of the neighborhood, which slopes up from the bay and has a recently renovated park that hosts Sunday concerts in summer, which is sure to appeal to prospective buyers from the city. \"But this isn’t Perth Amboy.\" He and many of his neighbors rarely shop in the commercial area along Smith Street several blocks away, he said, preferring to drive to nearby malls. But Barry Rosengarten, a developer who chairs Perth Amboy’s business improvement district, said the downtown is due for at least one large upgrade: New Jersey Transit has allocated funds for a $50 million redevelopment of the 1920s train station there, he noted. Such measures would help Perth Amboy join many other New Jersey cities in developing housing around transportation hubs. In support of this direction, Mayor Wilda Diaz’s office recently presented a plan to commercialize several blocks of Front Street near the water and raise the heights of downtown buildings. William Petrick, the City Council president, said the plan may not sufficiently address problems with aging infrastructure, including a neglected water supply and sewer system. \"But I don’t want to be a Debbie Downer,\" he added. \"We have some great history, and we need to focus on marketing that.\" Perth Amboy was first incorporated in 1683. It has wonderful historic buildings in various states of repair. Its city hall, part of which dates to 1714, is the oldest continuously operating municipal building in the United States. The last British royal governor’s palace in existence is on Kearny Avenue — a building called Proprietary House, where Benjamin Franklin’s Loyalist son, William, briefly lived before his arrest by militiamen. Perth Amboy also has a long post-colonial history of immigration, as conveyed by a neighborhood called Budapest and another formerly known as Dublin. About 80 percent of the town’s 52,000 residents are Latino, including the mayor, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico. David Caba, a local real estate agent, said buyers from New York are attracted not only to the single-family Victorians on the historic waterfront, but also the midcentury ranch homes in Spa Springs, a neighborhood with easy access to the Outerbridge Crossing to Staten Island. The nest of highways cutting through the city also includes the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway. Multifamily homes are more common in the center of Perth Amboy, Mr. Caba said, and are frequently bought by outside investors who rent them. Harbortown, a townhouse development below Route 440 that is expanding east toward the water, has a mix of condominiums and rental units; eventually there will be 1,800 units in all. Enrique Hernandez, founder of Petra Best Realty in Perth Amboy, said the housing market has picked up in the last two years because of continuing low interest rates and an infusion of buyers who have repaired bad credit and can now obtain financing. Demand has driven down inventory, so that only about 60 single-family houses were on the market as of November, compared with double that number two years ago, he said. And the supply of multifamily homes sharply decreased as well during the same period, from about 65 to 12. According to the real estate website Trulia, from May 24 to Aug. 23, the median sales price for homes in Perth Amboy was $210,625, based on 60 transactions, a year-on-year increase of 3 percent. Mr. Hernandez also noted a strong rental market. Monthly rents range from about $1,000 a month for a one-bedroom unit in a downtown building with a business on the lower floor to $2,600 for a three-bedroom townhouse in what he described as a \"good area.\" Standing at the shore, looking north over rippling water to the bridge to Staten Island and the garden of giant white petroleum tanks next to it, one is reminded that nature, historic pedigree and heavy industry make strange bedfellows in a town. Ms. Pozycki-Torres may have summed up Perth Amboy’s jagged edges best when she described her life there as \"very chill, but also very intense.\" Among Perth Amboy’s five elementary schools, Robert N. Wilentz, founded in 2000 to help ease overcrowding, enrolls about 960 students in kindergarten through fourth grade. On 2015-16 state tests, 36 percent met standards in English compared with 57 percent districtwide; 34 percent met standards in math versus 71 districtwide. One of two middle schools, William C. McGinnis enrolls 1,522 students in fifth through eighth grades. On state tests, 31 percent of students met standards in English versus 29 percent districtwide; 17 percent met standards in math versus 14 districtwide. Perth Amboy High School serves about 2,500 students in ninth through 12th grades. Mean 2016 SAT scores were 434 for reading/writing and 448 for math, versus 537 and 538 statewide. As the town’s student population continues to swell, a new high school is planned on Convery Boulevard. And ground was broken last month on Seaman Avenue for a 128,000-square-foot elementary school that is scheduled to open in the fall of 2019. New Jersey Transit’s North Jersey Coast line offers frequent train service from Perth Amboy to Pennsylvania Station. Rush hour trip times range from about 45 minutes to an hour and cost $12.25 each way, or $353 for a monthly pass. A bus operated by New Jersey Transit travels from Perth Amboy Station to Port Authority in about an hour and costs $10.75 each way. Perth Amboy began as Ompoge, a point of land deeded by the Leni Lenape Indians in 1651 to Augustine Herman, a Bohemian explorer. The name mutated to \"Amboy,\" and the word \"Perth\" was appended in 1684 to honor the Scotsman James Drummond, Earl of Perth, who helped settle the territory constituting much of present-day New Jersey. Perth Amboy’s imagined history from more than 3 billion B.C. to A.D. 22,175, all taking place on a single site across the street from Proprietary House, is represented in Richard McGuire’s 2014 graphic novel \"Here.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/realestate/living-in-perth-amboy-nj.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'House Hunting in … Jamaica', 'text': ' A FOUR-BEDROOM VILLA IN MONTEGO BAY $1.995 MILLION (ABOUT 250,000,000 JMD) This Mediterranean-style house is in Spring Farm, a gated hillside community in Montego Bay, on the northwestern coast of Jamaica. It is near many tourist attractions, including beaches and golf, and is about seven miles from Sangster International, one of the largest airports in the Caribbean. The two-story, white concrete structure is topped with a terra-cotta tile roof and sits on 1.3 landscaped acres, with ocean views. It has four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, as well as separate staff or guest quarters and a large central courtyard with a pool, hot tub, and areas for lounging and dining. This sprawling 6,800-square-foot house, built in 1994, is being sold fully furnished by the original owners, a local business executive and his family who are moving off the island, said Nicola Delapenha, an agent with Coldwell Banker Jamaica Realty, which is listing the property. The entry is on the main floor, through a semicircular foyer that looks out into the courtyard. On one side are a powder room, an en-suite bedroom, a home office and a formal living room; on the other, a large kitchen with a breakfast bar and a formal dining room. The kitchen and living and dining rooms all have French doors that open to the courtyard. The staff or guest quarters and a laundry room are also on the main level. Upstairs are three additional en-suite bedrooms and a sitting area/television room. The large master suite has French doors that open to a balcony, as well as a spacious dressing area and a spalike bathroom with a whirlpool tub and separate shower. There are ceramic tile and hardwood floors, beamed ceilings and ceiling fans throughout the home, which is decorated with traditional furniture and accessories. The gated community, in St. James Parish (population of around 185,000), is within walking distance of the Half Moon beachfront resort. Spring Farm owners and renters have access to the resort’s many amenities — including the spa and fitness center, golf, tennis and pools — through various membership plans. The Montego Bay area has long been a popular tourist destination, with warm weather, sandy beaches and a vibrant night life, along with a wide range of outdoor activities, including golf, scuba diving and dolphin- and whale-watching. The Rose Hall Great House, a restored 18th-century plantation house, is a prominent attraction about three miles from Spring Farm. Downtown Montego Bay is about nine miles away. MARKET OVERVIEW Jamaica’s housing market was weakened by the 2008 global financial crisis. But it has been steadily improving over the last five years, particularly in the luxury sector, thanks in large part to an increase in tourism and the return of foreign buyers, real estate agents said. The island nation was largely unscathed by hurricanes Irma and Maria, which barreled through the Caribbean recently, causing widespread fatalities and billions of dollars in damage. \"We’re really lucky,\" Ms. Delapenha said. Rory Marsh, operating principal of Keller Williams Jamaica, said that residential development has been on the rise, and sales of new luxury homes are up at least 25 percent over last year. \"The market is very strong right now,\" he said. Ongoing improvements to the country’s aging roadways, bridges and other public structures have helped real estate sales as well, especially in Montego Bay, Ms. Delapenha said. \"The area is a lot more attractive to buyers, thanks to an expanded and improved infrastructure.\" Vacation houses in Jamaica typically range in price from around $800,000 to as much as $10 million, Mr. Marsh said, while one- and two-bedroom condominiums near the beach start at around $200,000. WHO BUYS IN JAMAICA Most foreign buyers are from the United States, Canada and Britain, with a smaller number from Germany, agents said. Mr. Marsh estimated that 60 percent of international sales in Jamaica are to Americans, 20 percent are to Canadians and the rest are to buyers from Britain and Europe. \"A significant number\" of the properties they buy \"are operated as second homes, or villas, and are fully staffed,\" Ms. Delapenha said, adding that a number are also used as retirement homes. BUYING BASICS There are no restrictions on foreign ownership of property in Jamaica. Financing is available to non-Jamaican buyers, but minimum down payments may be higher — typically around 30 percent — said Wayne D. Silvera, a real estate lawyer in Montego Bay. Lawyers are involved in most aspects of a real estate transaction in Jamaica, from drafting the purchase agreement and conducting a title search to overseeing the deed transfer, the final step in a sale. The process is often completed within 60 days, Mr. Silvera said. The buyer’s lawyer is usually paid a fee based on a property’s sale price, ranging from 1 to 3 percent. \"The higher the home price, the lower the percentage, usually,\" Mr. Silvera said.

By way of putting out the welcome mat, a colleague invited the couple to dinner at a restaurant on the Upper East Side. They arrived early and went for a stroll, taking note of the stately houses, the mix of Queen Anne, Italianate, Beaux-Arts and Renaissance architecture, and shops like the Corner Bookstore. Smitten by the neighborhood, they rented a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor of a townhouse, on a quiet side street. \"It had just been renovated, so everything was brand new,\" Mr. Olafsson said. A few years later, when the first of their three children was born and the couple needed more room, they added half of the fifth floor. Then came the rest of the fifth floor and the sixth floor, which included the rooftop deck and garden. And, finally, the third floor and another parcel of outdoor space. (The rest of the building is given over to other lodgers.) With the approval of the owner, who has become a good friend, the Olafssons broke through ceilings and built floating wood staircases to connect the units. Along the way, they added a laundry room and did away with one bathroom and three kitchens, moving their own kitchen one flight up to capture as much sunlight as possible. \"One of the problems with townhouses is that the kitchen is usually on the ground floor, and that’s always the darkest place in the building,\" said Mr. Olafsson, who, like his wife, was born and raised in Reykjavik, Iceland. Granted, there is duplication of space: Each floor has a sitting room. The third-floor sitting room is the spot for doing puzzles and, thanks to the recent acquisition of a turntable, for listening to music. The fourth-floor sitting room is for watching television. The fifth-floor sitting room with the piano is the place for making music. But the family tends to do most of its sitting in the kitchen, which is outfitted with one of Mr. Olafsson’s favorite possessions, a Viking stove. Of course. Do the Olafssons ever ask themselves if it was crazy to do expensive renovations on an ever-expanding place they don’t own? Yes, they do. Often. \"I wouldn’t call this a perfect situation,\" Mr. Olafsson acknowledged. \"You probably wouldn’t design it this way if you were starting from scratch. And it may not have been the wisest financial move. But we don’t think about that much.\" He needn’t add that hope springs eternal. The owner has promised the Olafssons first dibs on the building should he ever decide to sell. Midcentury modern is the dominant theme, as represented by the kitchen table, by the desk and the Eames chair in Mr. Olafsson’s study, and by a Scandinavian side table, a bright-red Saarinen womb chair and an Eames lounge chair. But this is design without dogmatism. Deeming the effect too stark and off-putting, the Olafssons got rid of two very nice white midcentury sofas in the third-floor sitting room, replacing them with a pair of simple loden-green ones from Crate and Barrel. Books are everywhere. So is Icelandic art, which the couple avidly collects. Among the paintings are works by Kristjan Davidsson, Jon Engilberts, Georg Gudni and Hordur Agustsson. \"When I was growing up, I knew some of these people through my father, who was a novelist,\" Mr. Olafsson said. \"It’s always fun, in addition to having art you really like, to know the artist. You can still sort of relate to them through their work, though many of them have passed away.\" Four years ago, the Olafssons almost bought a six-story townhouse on the Upper West Side. What a prize: 7,000 square feet for them to divide and arrange as they pleased. \"We were thinking we could finally have everything exactly the way we wanted,\" Mr. Olafsson said. The contract was to be signed on a Monday. The preceding Friday, the couple’s architect gave them a floor plan of their future home along with, quite literally, a homework assignment: Figure out what rooms you want to put where. \"We sat down at the kitchen table, and we were so excited,\" Mrs. Olafsson said. \"We were like, ‘Oh, the kitchen will be here and the living room will be here.’ We would have the perfect little entryway for guests, the bedrooms up here, a little office for Olaf up there. And I was thinking, ‘Maybe I’ll get a nice laundry room and maybe an exercise room because I like to exercise.’\" Things were moving along nicely. \"And then we were like, ‘What are we going to do on the fifth and the sixth floor?’\" Mr. Olafsson recalled. \"‘We’re going to be talking to each other through an intercom. We’re going to be searching for each other.’ And our two sons were old enough that they were going to be out of the house soon.\" The couple looked across the table at each other, then looked again at the floor plan and the paperwork: 7,000 square feet; two years of construction. What were they thinking? They decided to stay put. \"We’re creatures of habit, I guess, but we like it here,\" Mr. Olafsson said. \"It’s home.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/realestate/olaf-olafsson-ever-expanding-rental.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Close Living: Two College Friends, One Bedroom', 'text': ' Caitlin Mulhall and Matthew Robison went to college together and moved to New York with plans to share a two-bedroom apartment. But as they quickly discovered, their limited budget made that a challenge. One day, Ms. Mulhall’s aunt, who was privy to their apartment-hunting woes, suggested something else: Why not share a one-bedroom? So Ms. Mulhall, 22, and Mr. Robison, 23, shifted gears last spring after they nearly rented a teeny two-bedroom on the Upper West Side that not only exceeded their $2,500 monthly budget, but was also so small that it would have been hard to socialize with one another inside — let alone with anyone else. A well-proportioned one-bedroom, they reasoned, would give them enough space for a loft bed in the living room and a big sofa for hanging out with friends. \"Even when I was growing up, I could never be by myself in my room for very long,\" Mr. Robison said. \"No, me neither,\" Ms. Mulhall said. \"That’s how my whole family is: all up in each other’s faces all the time. No one knocks.\" Last June, they rented a one-bedroom on East 85th Street for $2,450 a month, putting their cavalier attitude toward personal space to the test. Ms. Mulhall took the bedroom — which has two good-sized closets and overhead storage — and Mr. Robison has a loft bed in the living room. Underneath it, he keeps his clothes on a garment rack and in a large wicker trunk he found on the street. \"People will just throw stuff out at the end of the month — their couches, their beds,\" Mr. Robison said. \"It’s entertaining just to see all the random stuff.\" They split the rent, with Ms. Mulhall shouldering the utilities, which run about $150 a month. \"We must have seen at least 80 apartments,\" she said. Their broker, Kim Bloomfield, of Citi Habitats, convinced them to look on the East Side for more space and a shorter commute. At the time, Ms. Mulhall was doing package design in White Plains, N.Y. \"We’d walk into a place, and Kim would look at my face and be like, ‘No, never mind,’\" Ms. Mulhall said. \"Or we’d go in and be like, ‘Where would the bed fit in the living room?’ And she’d be like, ‘A bed doesn’t fit in here. Let’s go.’\" By the time Mr. Robison saw their current place, they had already lost out on several places they loved. He immediately called Ms. Mulhall to tell her that it was the ideal layout: The living room and bedroom were on opposite ends of the apartment, with the kitchen and bathroom in between, so neither one getting up in the middle of the night would disturb the other. \"If we wait,\" he warned, \"it will be gone.\" There was only one major drawback: a mini fridge rather than a full-size one (though, oddly enough, there is a full-size dishwasher). But while they’re a very short walk from many major train lines, Ms. Mulhall still wishes they had found something on the Upper West Side. \"I feel like it’s sunnier over there,\" she said ruefully. \"The buildings are shorter.\" \"But you could not fit this couch into most places we saw,\" said Mr. Robison, perching on the arm of the big sofa they bought for $65 on Craigslist. \"And it doesn’t feel crammed — it feels open,\" he said of the apartment, which is cheery and spacious, with large, storybook-like casement windows, high ceilings and a kitchen with a pretty blue-and-white tile backsplash. \"Not even when we have other people over,\" Ms. Mulhall agreed, pointing out that they often invite friends — and even her mother — to stay over on the sofa. It was her mother’s stories about working in New York in her 20s that made Ms. Mulhall want to move to New York. But the first job she got out of school — both she and Mr. Robinson attended the Columbus College of Art and Design in Ohio — was in the Bay Area, designing packaging for E. & J. Gallo Winery. Mr. Robison had also gone west and was doing set design in Los Angeles. During one late-night phone call, Ms. Mulhall told Mr. Robison that she wanted to move east and that he had to come with her. \"I didn’t know anyone in L.A.,\" Mr. Robison said. \"All my family is from Ohio and Pennsylvania.\" \"I love it,\" Ms. Mulhall said of New York. \"This is where I’m supposed to be. There’s so much to do here: Carl Schurz Park, Central Park, tempting shopping on 86th.\" Mr. Robinson added: \"Once this summer, we went to Coney Island and it only took us 45 minutes on the Q. And you can order food in the middle of the night.\" And as for sharing a one-bedroom? \"Sometimes I feel like I’m intruding on his space, because I’m always out here,\" Ms. Mulhall said. \"And then I’ll go in my room and he’ll be like, ‘Why are you in here?’\" The only awkward thing about their living situation, they agreed, is the neighbor whose kitchen is directly opposite Ms. Mulhall’s bedroom. \"I see this guy all the time,\" she lamented. \"One time I was bending over and we made eye contact under the drapes.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/realestate/close-living-two-college-friends-one-bedroom.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Homes That Sold for Around $750,000', 'text': ' 1060 Burroughs Road, Fairfield 7 WEEKS on the market $775,000 list price 1% BELOW list price SIZE 4 bedrooms, 2½ baths DETAILS A 25-year-old, vinyl-sided colonial with a living room with a fireplace, a family room with a vaulted ceiling, a formal dining room, an open front porch, and a deck.

But did you know that its developer, Edward Clark, had already given the name Wyoming to a building on West 55th Street? As might be expected of a coffee-table book about upper-class vertical living, \"Life at the Top: New York’s Most Exceptional Apartment Buildings\" (Vendome Press) is rich in such details. The book’s authors, Kirk Henckels and Anne Walker, approach the subject from two different wings. Mr. Henckels is the vice chairman of Stribling & Associates, a New York real estate company. Ms. Walker is an architectural historian and author. Their honor roll of 15 towers includes the impossibly glamorous 998 Fifth Avenue (1912), a McKim, Mead & White building developed by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis’s maternal grandfather; 720, 740 and 778 Park Avenue (1928 to 1931), designed by the Deco-era starchitect Rosario Candela; and Emery Roth’s Upper West Side Beresford (1930), which was at first lived in largely by affluent Jewish tenants who had been denied access to the palaces across Central Park. Also featured are more recent totems of New York wealth, like Richard Meier’s ultramodern 173 and 176 Perry Street buildings (2002); Robert A.M. Stern’s 15 Central Park West, a limestone-clad crib for extreme capitalists (2008); and Rafael Viñoly’s cloud-piercing 432 Park Avenue (2014). What persuaded wealthy New Yorkers in the late 19th century to leave their lovely townhouses and move into apartment buildings like the Dakota? Anne Walker Actually the Dakota’s residents weren’t the most elite New Yorkers; they were more professionals. But then 998 Fifth Avenue came along. It was a perfect storm: There was a building frenzy across the board, and there was advertising of all these different architects of that period. Kirk Henckels Here you have the super wealthy; they have a city house with a staff of 20 and another house with a staff of 40 because their wife made them build one in Newport. And income tax is creeping round. The economies of apartment buildings looked good. The problem was just getting that first person to sign on. Senator Elihu Root was highly respected and a member of Mrs. Astor’s 400. He moved into 998 as the first tenant because he got a deal. Value drives real estate in New York, even for the super wealthy. The floor plans you publish look like townhouses were pancaked and spread over vast apartment floors. Mr. Henckels When the Dakota was built, architects didn’t really know what to do with apartment buildings. It took a long time for that floor plan to evolve as it did. The difference in style from the Dakota in 1884 to 998 Fifth in 1912 was huge. The Dakota has long, very narrow hallways. You could almost call it, in quotes, \"mostly hall.\" The foyers were not big, the bathrooms were small and sparsely located. Things really changed. Ms. Walker And 998 is a lot more lavish than some of the later apartment buildings in the ’20s and ’30s because it was really trying to replicate those public rooms from the townhouses. By the time you get to the Beresford, buildings still had huge apartments but were less elaborate in terms of interior design and carvings and ceiling heights. The book describes the hard times some of these buildings fell on after the Depression, but the postwar years were prosperous. Weren’t any great apartment buildings constructed in the 1950s and 1960s? Mr. Henckels None. Zero. Not one built for this moneyed set between the ’30s and the turn of the 21st century. The early condominiums were for foreign investors and were really mostly one- and two-bedroom apartments. It wasn’t until 1998 that 515 Park Avenue became the first condo building targeting Upper East Side families. Part of this transition in the 21st century comes from the spreading of money around New York. Back in the 1980s, luxury was defined by Park Avenue, Fifth Avenue and Central Park West. But now the young people want to be downtown. And many of them are self-made. They haven’t necessarily grown up with the traditional trappings of wealth. You see this throughout all the decorative arts — the death of brown furniture, for instance. It doesn’t fit the contemporary modality. What was the most surprising thing you uncovered in your research? Ms. Walker For myself, it was the history of 778 Park Avenue. The address was originally 780 and then construction stopped for a year because it went bankrupt. It’s such a celebrated building; we don’t think of it in those terms. Mr. Henckels What I thought shocking was that the initial buildings were rentals. It was not just a jump from a mansion to an apartment building, but also a jump to not owning your own home. These were rentals because the prior co-ops had failed in the late 1800s. The cooperative structure did not have a great history at that point. Will anything like the Dakota ever be built again? Ms. Walker I think 15 Central Park West is probably the closest you’re going to get. One thing we loved about the Dakota apartment in our book was it could have existed more or less in the 1880s, except for the kitchen. Mr. Henckels Making the Dakota apartments really serviceable today without ruining their integrity takes some creativity. Some renovations are more successful than others. You have no closets, but there are a lot of fireplaces and enormous windows and great woodwork. How many historic apartments have maintained their original layouts? Does anyone ever keep those warrens of servants’ quarters? Mr. Henckels Most of the Candela buildings and others won’t permit major renovations, thank God. They will generally allow you to gut the staff areas and the kitchen and service areas. It doesn’t mean you can’t make the place contemporary or maybe take down a wall between the living room and dining room, but you can’t destroy the integrity of the apartment. The cooperative system has fortunately served a landmarking function for these architecturally spectacular buildings. If you were to do a sequel, what other buildings might you show? Ms. Walker I would include 770 Park by Candela, which is one of my favorites. Mr. Henckels And his 765 Park. There are five Candela sisters, as I call them. We only did three of them. And we were just itching to do the Osborne at 205 West 57th Street, and maybe the Gainsborough at 222 Central Park South. Ms. Walker We also considered including the Woolworth Building as an example of an office building turning residential.
