      "\n",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya — One month after a scathing United Nations report that called for a criminal investigation likely to lead back to its leaders, Burundi has withdrawn from the International Criminal Court, becoming the first country in the world to do so.\n",
      "A United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Burundi reported in September that it had found evidence of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and sexual violence in the two-and-a-half years since Burundi’s president, Pierre Nkurunziza, muscled his way to a third term in office.\n",
      "Burundi announced its intention to withdraw last year, at a time when the court was deeply unpopular with African leaders. Gambia and South Africa were also threatening to pull out, and the continent’s top intelligence officials signed a statement accusing the court of being “hijacked by powerful western countries” and “acting as a proxy” for foreign-led government change. But Mr. Nkurunziza can no longer count on leading a wave of exits.\n",
      "Gambia reversed course on its threat after Yahya Jammeh, its president for 22 years, departed following his electoral defeat by Adama Barrow. South Africa revoked its withdrawal in March, after its High Court ruled that Parliament would have to approve the measure.\n",
      "“For the court, I continue to think this is not going to mean very much,” said Kate Cronin-Furman, a human rights lawyer and postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. “Burundi is a pretty peripheral player, and their walkout is not going to threaten the court’s legitimacy or its prospects going forward.”\n",
      "Still, the court’s reputation took a hit last year when it essentially dropped charges against Kenya’s deputy president, William Ruto, for lack of evidence. Two years earlier, it withdrew charges against Uhuru Kenyatta, Kenya’s president. Both men had been accused of crimes against humanity over the violence after the country’s 2007 election, in which more than 1,100 people were killed and hundreds of thousands more were displaced.\n",
      "Nine of the 10 current formal investigations by the office of the court’s prosecutor concern Africa, and all of its trials so far have involved African defendants.\n",
      "“I think there is an ongoing concern about the court’s ability to work in countries in Africa,” said Rebecca Hamilton, an assistant professor of law at American University who previously worked in the International Criminal Court’s prosecution division.\n",

      "View all New York Times newsletters.\n",
      "“When you still have a government in power, we’re seeing how difficult it can be to conduct an investigation,” she added. “Where the court is interested in a rebel group or a group that’s not in power, it’s a different story. But power fights back against justice. That’s the bottom line, and that’s not unique to Africa.”\n",
      "Burundi might still end up in the court’s sights, however. Under its founding charter, known as the Rome Statute, crimes in nonmember states can still be referred for investigation by the United Nations Security Council. The United Nations’ commission of inquiry on Burundi recommended such a referral.\n",
      "The court’s work on events in Burundi has been in the exploratory stages, known as a “preliminary examination.” A spokesman for the court told The Associated Press that it would retain jurisdiction.\n",
      "It may struggle to do so, however, according to Mark Kersten, deputy director of the Wayamo Foundation, an international justice organization.\n",
      "“The rules are clearer on an investigation, but the I.C.C. hasn’t opened one,” he said. “It only has this preliminary examination.”\n",
      "For the examination to become an investigation, he said, the court’s judges would have to grant permission to the prosecutor, and Burundi might claim there was no legal basis for moving ahead after its withdrawal.\n",
      "“I think that could potentially create a lot of debate among other states,” Mr. Kersten said.\n",

Mueller III, announced charges on Monday against three advisers to President Trump’s campaign and laid out the most explicit evidence to date that his campaign was eager to coordinate with the Russian government to damage his rival, Hillary Clinton. The former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, surrendered to the F.B.I. and pleaded not guilty to charges that he laundered millions of dollars through overseas shell companies — using the money to buy luxury cars, real estate, antique rugs and expensive clothes. Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort’s longtime associate as well as a campaign adviser, was also charged and turned himself in. But information that could prove most politically damaging to Mr. Trump came an hour later, when Mr. Mueller announced that George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, had pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and was cooperating with investigators. In court documents released on Monday, federal investigators said they suspected that Russian intelligence services had used intermediaries to contact Mr. Papadopoulos to gain influence with the campaign, offering \"dirt\" on Mrs. Clinton in April 2016 in the form of \"thousands of emails.\" Mr. Papadopoulos secretly pleaded guilty weeks ago to lying to the F.B.I. about those contacts and has been cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors for months. Monday’s dramatic announcements capped months of speculation about which of Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers might be first to be charged by Mr. Mueller, and they seemed to be a sign that the special counsel’s investigation is nowhere close to complete. \"There’s a large-scale, ongoing investigation of which this case is a small part,\" Aaron S.J. Zelinsky, a prosecutor on Mr. Mueller’s team, said at Mr. Papadopoulos’s plea hearing this month. The transcript of the hearing was released on Monday. It is now clear, from Mr. Papadopoulos’s admission and emails related to a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016, that the Russian government offered help to Mr. Trump’s candidacy and campaign officials were willing to take it. The United States has concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia tried to tip the outcome of the 2016 election in favor of Mr. Trump. As part of that effort, Russian operatives hacked Democratic accounts and released a trove of embarrassing emails related to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Mueller and his team are investigating whether anyone close to Mr. Trump participated in that effort. The announcements rippled across Washington, affecting both political parties. The powerful Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta quit his lobbying firm Monday. The firm, the Podesta Group, was hired to do lobbying work on behalf of Ukraine, work that is at the heart of Mr. Manafort’s indictment. The tax and money laundering case against Mr. Manafort describes a complicated scheme in which he lobbied for a pro-Russia party in Ukraine and its leader, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and hid proceeds in bank accounts in Cyprus, the Grenadines and elsewhere. Prosecutors say he laundered more than $18 million, and spent the money extravagantly. A home improvement company in the Hamptons was paid nearly $5.5 million, according to the indictment. More than $1.3 million more went to clothing stores in New York and Beverly Hills, Calif. Mr. Manafort bought a $3 million brownstone in Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn and a $2.8 million condominium in SoHo, prosecutors said. \"Manafort used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States without paying taxes on that income,\" the indictment reads. He was also charged with failing to register as a foreign lobbyist. The charges carry the potential for roughly 20 years in prison, putting pressure on Mr. Manafort to provide information on others in exchange for leniency. Among other things, Mr. Manafort could shed light on how widely in the campaign it was known that Russia had damaging information on Mrs. Clinton. A senior White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, said last week that the president was confident that Mr. Manafort had no damaging information about him. In a court appearance on Monday, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates pleaded not guilty and were placed under house arrest on multimillion-dollar bonds. Mr. Papadopoulos is awaiting sentencing. Mr. Manafort’s lawyer, Kevin Downing, called the money laundering charges \"ridiculous\" and noted that in the past half-century, prosecutors have charged only a handful of people with flouting foreign lobbying rules. Such violations are normally handled as an administrative matter. Mr. Manafort’s Ukraine lobbying \"ended in 2014, two years before Mr. Manafort served in the Trump campaign,\" Mr. Downing said. Lawyers for Mr. Papadopoulos declined to comment. While the indictment paints an unflattering picture of the man Mr. Trump tapped to run his campaign, the allegations long predate his involvement in the presidential race. Mr. Trump seized on that fact, declaring on Twitter that \"there is NO COLLUSION!\" But as Mr. Trump typed out that message, Mr. Mueller’s team was unsealing documents related to Mr. Papadopoulos that directly undermined the president’s claim. Mr. Trump called Mr. Papadopoulos an \"excellent guy\" when he announced his foreign policy team in March 2016. On Monday, however, White House officials described him as someone who played an insignificant role in the campaign. \"Look, this individual was a member of a volunteer advisory council that met one time over the course of a year,\" said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \"I’m not here to speak on behalf of the thousands of people that may have volunteered on the campaign.\" In March 2016, while traveling in Italy, Mr. Papadopoulos met a London-based professor of diplomacy who has deep ties to the Russian government. The professor took interest in Mr. Papadopoulos \"because of his status with the campaign,\" court documents said. The professor is Joseph Mifsud, according to a Senate aide familiar with emails in which Mr. Mifsud is mentioned. Two Senate committees are conducting Russia inquiries of their own, and investigators have been poring over thousands of emails produced by the Trump campaign. Mr. Mifsud introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to others, including someone with ties to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a woman who he believed was a relative of Mr. Putin. Mr. Papadopoulos repeatedly tried to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials, court records show. \"We are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\" the woman, who was not identified, told Mr. Papadopoulos in an email. She was not actually a relative of Mr. Putin, according to court documents. Campaign officials knew that Mr. Papadopoulos was developing contacts in Russia, court documents show. He repeatedly tried to arrange a formal meeting for Mr. Trump in Russia. Among those in the campaign who knew about the contacts was Sam Clovis, who helped supervise the foreign-policy team, according to a former campaign aide. Mr. Clovis could not be reached for comment. Ultimately, senior campaign officials said that Mr. Trump should not make the trip and leave it to \"someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,\" according to an email cited in court papers. No campaign official made a formal trip to Russia. When F.B.I. agents approached Mr. Papadopoulos on Jan. 27, he lied about his Russian contacts, according to court documents. That day, Mr. Trump invited the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to dinner at the White House and asked him to pledge loyalty, according to notes Mr. Comey took at the time. As the F.B.I. scrutiny continued, Mr. Papadopoulos changed his phone number and deleted his Facebook account, which he had used to communicate with the Russians. The F.B.I. has obtained emails, text messages, and the transcript of chats on Facebook and Skype records as part of its investigation. F.B.I. agents quietly arrested Mr. Papadopoulos at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on July 27, a day after agents raided Mr. Manafort’s Virginia home. The Justice Department disclosed on Monday that Mr. Manafort had withheld evidence from Mr. Mueller that was discovered during that raid. With the charges against Mr. Manafort, Mr. Mueller has taken a broad view of his mandate. He was tapped to investigate Russian election meddling, whether anyone around Mr. Trump was involved and other crimes that followed from that investigation. The charges against Mr. Manafort do not directly relate to Mr. Trump or the campaign. Mr. Manafort had been under investigation in New York and Virginia until Mr. Mueller was appointed and assumed control. The special counsel has struck an aggressive posture in the case, and Monday’s charges were no exception. The Justice Department often invites lawyers to meet and discuss potential indictments. It is both an opportunity for lawyers to argue for leniency, and for prosecutors to spot potential weaknesses in their case. But on Friday night, people close to Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates and lawyers involved in the investigation said they had received no indication that an indictment against them was imminent.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/paul-manafort-indicted.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Mueller’s First Indictments Send a Message to Trump', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — Shortly after his former campaign chairman marched into an F.B.I. office to face criminal charges on Monday, President Trump took to Twitter to dismiss their relevance: \"There is NO COLLUSION!\" Yet even as his message went out to more than 41 million followers, news emerged that the authorities were unsealing another case that described how a young foreign policy adviser spent months seeking to connect Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russians offering \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton. The first charges filed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, did not implicate Mr. Trump but collectively amounted to a political body blow to a president who has spent months insisting that Mr. Mueller’s investigation was nothing more than a \"witch hunt\" based on a \"hoax\" invented by Democrats and the news media. The indictment of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, suggested that the president’s top lieutenant for part of last year was a highly paid agent for pro-Russian foreign interests. And the guilty plea extracted from George Papadopoulos, the foreign policy adviser, confirmed the second known attempt by Mr. Trump’s team to tap Moscow for damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, coming months before his son Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer for the same purpose. The legal action propelled the special counsel investigation into a new and more dangerous phase for Mr. Trump, who had hoped to spend this week focused on his appointment of a new Federal Reserve chairman, the introduction of his tax-cutting legislation and the start of a 12-day trip to Asia. \"It’s obviously a big-deal day. These are big-deal developments,\" said John Q. Barrett, who served as associate independent counsel during the Iran-contra investigation. Inside the White House, the mood changed drastically throughout the morning. Although Mr. Manafort was the first president’s former campaign chief indicted since John N. Mitchell during Watergate, aides to Mr. Trump felt momentarily relieved that it had largely tracked their expectations and did not include any surprise allegations involving the campaign. But then, just as Mr. Trump tweeted that the charges involved actions that took place \"before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,\" the news about Mr. Papadopoulos stunned and alarmed White House aides. Mr. Trump said nothing more publicly through the day and left it to his advisers to argue that the cases did not impugn him because Mr. Manafort’s actions were unrelated to his campaign service while Mr. Papadopoulos was just a volunteer whose efforts to set up meetings with higher-ranking officials were unrealized and who pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I. agents, not to illegal campaign activity. \"Today’s announcement has nothing to do with the president, has nothing to do with the president’s campaign or campaign activity,\" said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. She added, \"We’ve been saying from Day 1 there has been no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all.\" Jay Sekulow, a private lawyer for Mr. Trump, said the president and his legal team were not worried about the indictments. \"No, not concerned,\" Mr. Sekulow said on CNN. \"I’m completely convinced, as I was from the outset, that not only was there no Russian collusion, there was no obstruction.\" He added, \"I’m not concerned about this at all, and no one else is either.\" But lawyers and former prosecutors said Mr. Papadopoulos’s admissions and the previously reported meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. already undercut such denials. \"Collusion is what Papadopoulos did. Collusion is what Trump Jr. and others in that meeting did,\" Mr. Barrett said. \"It’s meeting and discussing and seeing what common interests they can advance for each other.\" Mr. Mueller’s action also made it harder for Mr. Trump to brush off the investigation and blame Democrats. \"After Mr. Trump whipped up a tweet storm of suspicion about Mueller this weekend, he really now has no place to go with this attack,\" said Robert F. Bauer, a White House counsel under President Barack Obama. \"Mueller’s first charge is beyond any potential claim of ‘politics’ or ‘stretching’ that the president might wish to bring against him and his office.\" The gravity of the threat may yet tempt Mr. Trump to take action to short-circuit the investigation, such as firing Mr. Mueller or pardoning Mr. Manafort or others. Conservative activists said Monday that Mr. Mueller should be pressed to resign because the charges against Mr. Manafort were not directly related to the campaign and therefore outside his prosecutorial mandate. Roger J. Stone Jr., a sometimes adviser to the president, told The Daily Caller, a conservative website, that the president should not fire Mr. Mueller but could accomplish the same outcome by directing the Justice Department to investigate a deal consummated when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state giving Russian interests a share of the American uranium market. Because Mr. Mueller was the F.B.I. director at the time, he could come under scrutiny and therefore could no longer conduct the Russia investigation because of a conflict of interest, Mr. Stone argued. That, he said, was Mr. Trump’s \"only chance for survival.\" Both Ms. Sanders and Mr. Sekulow disputed suggestions that Mr. Trump might seek to fire Mr. Mueller. \"There is no intention or plan to make any changes in regards to the special counsel,\" Ms. Sanders said. The two also played down the possibility that Mr. Trump might pardon Mr. Manafort or others caught in the investigation. \"I haven’t had a conversation with the president about pardons or pardoning individuals,\" Mr. Sekulow said. Ms. Sanders likewise said that she had not spoken with the president about the possibility of pardons. In the past, the president has signaled that he might dismiss Mr. Mueller if the special counsel exceeded what Mr. Trump considers the bounds of his investigation. Mr. Trump has also publicly noted that he has the \"complete power to pardon\" relatives, aides and possibly even himself in response to the special counsel investigation. Democrats warned Mr. Trump on Monday not to impede Mr. Mueller’s investigation. \"The president must not, under any circumstances, interfere with the special counsel’s work in any way,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. \"If he does so, Congress must respond swiftly, unequivocally and in a bipartisan way to ensure that the investigation continues.\" Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the indictment showed that Mr. Mueller was \"doing his job\" and that the process was working. \"I’ll continue to support Bob Mueller as he follows the facts — his independence must remain sacrosanct,\" she said. With the indictments, Mr. Mueller made clear that he was not to be underestimated. In one court document, his team used two words to describe Mr. Papadopoulos that might send a chill down the spines of some in Mr. Trump’s circle: \"proactive cooperator.\" Mr. Papadopoulos has been cooperating with prosecutors for three months, and his statement refers to several other campaign advisers he consulted as he reached out to Russian officials. Moreover, former prosecutors said the charges against Mr. Manafort and Rick Gates, Mr. Manafort’s longtime associate and also a Trump campaign adviser, were so serious that they might be an attempt to scare one or both into cooperating. A White House lawyer said last week that the president has nothing to fear if Mr. Manafort does talk with investigators, but Mr. Mueller and his team of prosecutors appear intent on finding that out themselves. \"They’ve done phenomenal work, they’ve done it quickly, they’ve done it ruthlessly, and they’ve done it efficiently,\" said Solomon L. Wisenberg, who was the deputy independent counsel during the investigation that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton on charges of lying under oath about his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. \"They’re sending a message: ‘We’re here to stay; don’t mess with us.’\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/trump-manafort-indictment-analysis.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Trump Campaign Got Early Word Russia Had Democrats’ Emails', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — The guilty plea of a 30-year-old campaign aide — so green that he listed Model United Nations in his qualifications — shifted the narrative on Monday of the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia: Court documents revealed that Russian officials alerted the campaign, through an intermediary in April 2016, that they possessed thousands of Democratic emails and other \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton. That was two months before the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee was publicly revealed and the stolen emails began to appear online. The new court filings provided the first clear evidence that Trump campaign aides had early knowledge that Russia had stolen confidential documents on Mrs. Clinton and the committee, a tempting trove in a close presidential contest. By the time of a crucial meeting in June of last year, when Donald Trump Jr. and other senior Trump campaign officials met with a Russian lawyer offering damaging information on Mrs. Clinton, some may have known for weeks that Russia had material likely obtained by illegal hacking, the new documents suggested. The disclosures added to the evidence pointing to attempts at collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, but they appeared to fall short of proof that they conspired in the hacking or other illegal acts. The improbable figure at the center of the new information was a \"foreign policy adviser\" to Mr. Trump, George Papadopoulos. It was Mr. Papadopoulos, one of three men whose charges were announced on Monday, who appears to have been the first campaign aide to learn about the Russian hacking of Democratic targets. A crucial detail is still missing: Whether and when Mr. Papadopoulos told senior Trump campaign officials about Russia’s possession of hacked emails. And it appears that the young aide’s quest for a deeper connection with Russian officials, while he aggressively pursued it, led nowhere. Mr. Papadopoulos repeatedly promoted the idea of a \"history making\" meeting between Mr. Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. Senior campaign officials, however, said that Mr. Trump should not make the trip and leave it to someone \"low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,’’ according to an email cited in court documents. Mr. Papadopoulos then proposed that he himself, perhaps with another campaign official, travel to Moscow to meet with the Russians. \"The trip proposed by defendant PAPADOPOULOS did not take place,\" prosecutors wrote. To grasp the significance of Monday’s developments, it helps to recall exactly how the Russian attack unfolded. In September 2015, the F.B.I. made its first call to the Democratic National Committee to report evidence of Russian hackers inside the committee’s network. But for seven months, the word never got beyond an I.T. contractor, and the hackers apparently had the run of confidential emails and other files. During that time, Mr. Trump was pressed to assemble a team of foreign policy advisers, a difficult task because he was shunned by many Republicans who had served in earlier administrations. In early March, Mr. Papadopoulos, who had been helping the beleaguered campaign of Dr. Ben Carson, offered his services to the Trump campaign. Around March 6, documents say, a campaign supervisor – identified by a former Trump adviser as Sam Clovis – told Mr. Papadopoulos, then living in London, that \"a principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved relationship with Russia.\" A week later, traveling in Italy, Mr. Papadopoulos encountered a London-based professor of international relations, Joseph Mifsud, who claimed to have \"substantial connections with Russian government officials.\" (The court documents do not name Mr. Mifsud, but a Senate aide briefed on the case identified him as the professor in question.) Unimpressed by Mr. Papadopoulos at first, Mr. Mifsud became far more interested when he learned that the young traveler was working for the Trump campaign. The two men met again in London on March 24, when the professor introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to a Russian woman he said was a relative of Mr. Putin with close ties to senior Russian officials. The same week, Mr. Trump, visiting The Washington Post, was pressed to name his foreign policy team. He read out five names, most of them with modest or nonexistent public profiles – including Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Papadopoulos began emailing campaign officials about his new contacts with his \"good friend\" Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman, whom he incorrectly believed was Mr. Putin’s niece, and the possibility of a Trump-Putin meeting. On March 31, back in Washington, Mr. Papadopoulos met Mr. Trump for the first time at a gathering of his new foreign policy team at the candidate’s Washington hotel. According to the former Trump adviser who was there, and who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid offending former colleagues, Mr. Papadopoulos spoke for a few minutes about his Russian contacts and the prospects for a meeting with the Russian president. But several people in the room began to raise questions about the wisdom of a meeting with Mr. Putin, noting that Russia was under sanctions from the United States. Jeff Sessions, now attorney general and then a senator from Alabama who was counseling Mr. Trump on national security, \"shut George down,\" the adviser said. \"He said, ‘We’re not going to do it’ and he added, ‘I’d prefer that nobody speak about this again.’\" But Mr. Papadopoulos was not deterred, the documents say, and he continued to communicate with Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman about more contacts. The Russian woman wrote on April 11, \"we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump.\" Mr. Mifsud introduced Mr. Papadopoulos over email to a Moscow contact who said he had connections to the Russian foreign ministry. They spoke repeatedly over Skype about a possible Moscow trip, the documents say. On April 26 came a crucial meeting. At breakfast at a London hotel, Mr. Mifsud told Mr. Papadopoulos that he had just returned from Moscow, where he had \"learned that the Russians had obtained ‘dirt’ on then-candidate Clinton.\" Mr. Mifsud said he had been told the Russians had \"thousands of emails.\" On May 4, the Russian contact with ties to the foreign ministry wrote to Mr. Papadopoulos and Mr. Mifsud, saying ministry officials were \"open for cooperation.\" Mr. Papadopoulos forwarded the message to a senior campaign official, asking whether the contacts were \"something we want to move forward with.\" The court documents describe in detail how Mr. Papadopoulos continued to report to senior campaign officials on his efforts to arrange meetings with Russian officials, which The Washington Post reported on in August. But the documents do not say explicitly whether, and to whom, he passed on his most explosive discovery – that the Russians had what they considered compromising emails on Mr. Trump’s opponent. J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon official who worked for the Trump campaign as a national security adviser and helped arrange the March 31 foreign policy meeting, said he had known nothing about Mr. Papadopoulos’ discovery that Russia had obtained Democratic emails or of his prolonged pursuit of meetings with Russians. \"I was surprised to learn what George Papadopoulos was up to during the campaign,\" Mr. Gordon said in a text message. \"He obviously went to great lengths to go around me and Senator Sessions.\" Mr. Gordon said that such end-runs around normal channels are common in presidential campaigns. \"It’s very hard to know what every single person is doing, especially since some folks deliberately go around the chain of command,\" he said. \"But George Papadopoulos obviously represents an extreme case.\" Prosecutors may have deliberately left salient details out of the documents filed in court to protect the continuing investigation. But what they did say portrays Mr. Papadopoulos as continuing for months to arrange meetings with Russian officials. As late as August 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos was advised by a campaign official, apparently Mr. Clovis, to travel to Moscow \"if it is feasible.\" Instead of opening a new era in relations with Russia, Mr. Papadopoulos found himself caught up in the investigation of the Russian interference in the American election. The documents accuse him of lying to F.B.I. agents in two interviews, first on Jan. 27 and then on Feb. 16, when he \"reiterated his purported willingness to cooperate with the F.B.I.’s investigation,\" according to an affidavit filed by Robert M. Gibbs, an F.B.I. agent investigating the case. On Feb. 17, the agent wrote, Mr. Papadopoulos shut down the Facebook account he had used since 2005, including to exchange messages with the intermediaries for Russia. Prosecutors considered that to be obstruction of justice, and it became part of the case that concluded Oct. 5 when Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to make a false statement to the F.B.I., which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/trump-russia-mueller-indictment.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Judge Blocks Trump’s Ban on Transgender Troops in Military', 'text': ' A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked a White House policy barring military service by transgender troops, ruling that it was based on \"disapproval of transgender people generally.\" Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia found the administration’s justification for the ban, which was set to take effect in March 2018, to be suspect and likely unconstitutional. She ruled that the military’s current policy should remain in place. \"There is absolutely no support for the claim that the ongoing service of transgender people would have any negative effective on the military at all,\" the judge wrote in a strongly worded, 76-page ruling. \"In fact, there is considerable evidence that it is the discharge and banning of such individuals that would have such effects.\" Judge Kollar-Kotelly noted that the White House’s proposed policies likely violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution, writing that \"a number of factors — including the sheer breadth of the exclusion ordered by the directives, the unusual circumstances surrounding the President’s announcement of them, the fact that the reasons given for them do not appear to be supported by any facts, and the recent rejection of those reasons by the military itself — strongly suggest that Plaintiffs’ Fifth Amendment claim is meritorious.\" Monday’s ruling was seen as an encouraging step for supporters. It stops a plan to discharge all transgender troops, allows current transgender troops to re-enlist and permits transgender recruits to join the military starting in January. \"She basically wiped the slate clean,\" said Shannon Minter, a lawyer at the National Center for Lesbian Rights who represented the plaintiffs, adding that while the ruling could be appealed, he was confident that it effectively marked the end of the ban because the judge said it violated the Constitution. Judge Kollar-Kotelly did not impose an injunction on the ban on sex reassignment surgery because she said it did not apply to any of the plaintiffs. But the plaintiffs’ lawyers argued that in blocking the entire policy, the ruling effectively shelved the ban on sex reassignment surgery as well. In a statement, the Justice Department said, \"We disagree with the court’s ruling and are currently evaluating the next steps.\" President Trump announced in a series of Twitter messages in July that American forces could not afford the \"tremendous medical costs and disruption\" of transgender troops, and said \"the United States Government will not accept or allow them to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\" A presidential memorandum released in August required all transgender service members to be discharged starting in March 2018. The announcement blindsided many in the military, which had been moving ahead with plans to integrate transgender troops, based on a 2016 study commissioned by the military that found that allowing transgender people to serve openly would \"have minimal impact on readiness and health care costs\" for the Pentagon. It estimated that health care costs would rise $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year, representing an almost unnoticeable 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in spending. The study also projected \"little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness.\" Civil rights groups immediately sued the administration on behalf of transgender service members, arguing that the ban was discriminatory and violated their constitutional right to due process and equal protection under the law. A number of lawsuits are still pending. The government had asked that the case be dismissed, but Judge Kollar-Kotelly denied the motion, writing that while \"perhaps compelling in the abstract,\" the government’s arguments for dismissal \"wither away under scrutiny.\" Judge Kollar-Kotelly was nominated to a lower court in the District of Columbia by President Ronald Reagan and was named to the federal bench by President Bill Clinton. The suit was filed by GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders and the National Center for Lesbian Rights on behalf of five unnamed transgender women serving in the Coast Guard, Army and Air Force. Many of the women had served for years as men and had been deployed to war zones before coming out to commanders when the ban was lifted in 2016. One is a few years from retirement, according to court documents. Another told her commander she wanted to keep serving, but would resign if the military moved to forcibly discharge her. \"Big, huge news today,\" said Lt. Cmdr. Blake Dremann, a Navy supply corps officer who is transgender and is the director of Sparta, an L.G.B.T. military group with more than 650 active-duty members. \"A lot of people’s lives were put on hold. They thought their careers were ending. This means we can continue to serve with honor, as we have been doing.\" Petty Officer Eva Kerry, 24, who is transgender and is training to operate nuclear reactors, said the ruling lifted an obsessive dread over the impending end of a Navy career she loves. \"I remain optimistic that the Constitution I swore an oath to will continue to protect the rights of all Americans,\" she said on Monday. The decision is the latest in a series of controversial White House policies halted by the courts, including limiting travel from predominantly Muslim countries and withholding federal grant money from so-called sanctuary cities. Asked for comment, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the Justice Department was reviewing the ruling. The lawsuit is premature, the Justice Department said, because \"none of the plaintiffs have established that they will be impacted by current policies on military service.\" The decision is a blow for social conservatives, who have pushed to curtail transgender policies since the ban was lifted in 2016. In June, some Republicans in Congress unsuccessfully sought to force a ban on sex reassignment surgery by attaching it to the annual military spending bill. In response, Mr. Trump made a far bolder move to ban transgender service members entirely. At the time, Representative Vicky Hartzler, a Republican from Missouri, openly praised what she said was the president’s willingness to put national security first. On Monday, her press secretary said she would not comment on the ruling. Democrats in Congress, who in September introduced legislation to protect transgender troops from discharge, were quick to mark a victory. \"Federal courts have again beat back the sinister specter of discrimination bred within the Trump White House,\" Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said in a statement. \"This court order will allow our transgender troops to continue serving based on their ability to fight, train, and deploy — regardless of gender identity.\" Logan Ireland, an Air Force staff sergeant who was not involved in the lawsuits, said he and other transgender troops were hopeful but cautious. He said the president could still take steps to discharge them. More than anything, the Afghanistan veteran, who leads security forces, said he hoped the end of the ban would allow him to concentrate more on his work. \"We want to go back to serving,\" he said. \"There are troops that work under me, there is work to be done. We want to do it. After all, we are here for our country, not who sits in the White House.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/military-transgender-ban.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Trump Is Expected to Name Jerome Powell as Next Fed Chairman', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to nominate Jerome H. Powell as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, replacing Janet L. Yellen, whose term expires early next year, according to two people familiar with the plans. Mr. Powell, a Fed governor since 2012, is a Republican with deep roots in the party’s establishment and in the financial industry. He has steadily supported Ms. Yellen’s approach to monetary policy and financial regulation, creating an expectation that he would be unlikely to attempt large or sharp changes in the Fed’s course. One White House official described Mr. Powell as a \"safe\" choice as well as the candidate who most closely fit Mr. Trump’s penchant for filling top jobs with characters from \"central casting,\" as he has often put it. Both people familiar with the president’s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that Mr. Trump was notoriously mercurial and liked creating drama around important personnel decisions. However, both said the president appeared set on Mr. Powell. An announcement could come as soon as Thursday, after the Fed wraps up a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and before Mr. Trump leaves on Friday for a 12-day Asia trip. The choice would cap an unusually public selection process, during which the president has openly discussed his views of various candidates, asked Republican senators to vote by raising their hands for those under consideration and sought the opinion of a television host. Mr. Trump also posted a video on Instagram promising \"everybody will be very impressed\" with his selection. In looking past Ms. Yellen, Mr. Trump would be breaking with longstanding precedent. Every Fed chairman in modern history who completed a first four-year term was nominated for a second. The last three Fed chairmen were nominated for new terms by a president of the opposite party. And Mr. Trump has praised Ms. Yellen’s performance: During her four years, unemployment has fallen sharply, inflation has remained low and the economy is growing. \"You like to make your own mark,\" Mr. Trump said last week, by way of explanation. In choosing Mr. Powell, however, Mr. Trump would be resisting pressure by conservatives to make a larger mark on the Fed’s management of the economy. Many conservatives, including Vice President Mike Pence, favored the selection of John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist who has been an outspoken critic of the Fed’s monetary policy. Mr. Powell, by contrast, has voted for every Fed policy decision since 2012, although he expressed some reservations in internal debates about the extent of those efforts. In recent years, he has backed the methodical unwinding of the Fed’s stimulus campaign, which involved purchasing $4 trillion worth of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to help the economy recover from the 2008 financial crisis. Fed officials are often labeled hawks if they favor higher interest rates to control inflation, or doves if they want to keep rates low to promote job growth. Richard Fisher, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who worked with Mr. Powell at the Fed, said Mr. Powell \"is neither a hawk nor a dove.\" \"I used to say that we all want to be wise owls,\" he added, \"and I think that he fits that category very well.\" Mr. Fisher said Mr. Powell was moderate to a fault. \"I’ve tried to get him to drink more than two glasses of wine at dinner, and he will not do it,\" he said. A survey of 144 investors conducted by Evercore ISI found that they expected that Mr. Powell would push rates modestly higher than Ms. Yellen over time. Mr. Powell also has sought a middle ground on the contentious debate over financial regulation. Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans argue that excessive regulation is restraining economic growth. At a Senate hearing in June, Mr. Powell agreed that there was room to improve regulation, but he described the Trump administration’s proposals as a \"mixed bag,\" adding that he opposed some of the specific proposals. Describing an effort already underway at the Fed, he said, \"The whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work.\" Mr. Powell would require Senate confirmation, and his views, particularly on regulation, could draw opposition from some conservatives in the Senate, 21 of whom voted against his confirmation as a Fed governor in 2014. Two Republicans on the Senate banking committee, which will consider the nomination, had previously raised concerns about Mr. Powell: Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina and Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania. If nominated and confirmed, Mr. Powell would be the first Fed chair in four decades without an economics degree. He brings a background in financial markets, a contrast with Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. People who have worked with Mr. Powell say he studied economics assiduously after joining the Fed, gathering stacks of papers on the questions of the day, then reading and discussing the findings with colleagues. \"I think it’s far more important to understand and appreciate high-quality economic analysis than it is to have a Ph.D.,\" said Kim Schoenholtz, a professor of economics at New York University. He noted that most Treasury secretaries had not held degrees in economics. \"What distinguishes the most effective secretaries is skill at bringing in talented personnel and appreciation for the value of informed economic analyses,\" he said. Jon Faust, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University who worked with Mr. Powell at the Fed, said Mr. Powell had endeavored to understand monetary policy and had demonstrated a strong grasp of the subject. But Mr. Faust said it might be particularly important to have a trained economist as chairman if there was another recession. \"If the economy broadly behaves, I don’t think it’ll be of great consequence,\" Mr. Faust said. \"If we were to face another period where you need innovative and creative leadership, Jay has a lot of skills, and it could still go O.K., but you’d like to add to those skills a lifetime of studying monetary policy.\" Mr. Powell, 64, is a Washington native who has spent most of his life in a mix of public and private roles. He studied politics at Princeton University, then earned a law degree from Georgetown University before embarking on a career in investment banking in New York. In 1990, he returned to Washington to work for his former boss, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, as under secretary for finance. When Salomon Brothers was caught manipulating the market in Treasuries, Mr. Powell, vacationing on Cape Cod, spent a long August weekend on the phone arranging for top managers to resign and for Warren E. Buffett to be chairman of the company’s board. Under pressure to account for the shortcomings in regulation, Mr. Powell told a congressional committee in 1991, \"There is no question that it can be improved, and improve it we will.\" Mr. Powell joined the private equity firm Carlyle Group in 1997 and earned a fortune. His most recent financial disclosure showed a net worth of as much as $55 million. In 2005, he left the firm to focus on fiscal policy as a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He attracted the attention of the Obama administration in 2011 for his work behind the scenes to persuade congressional Republicans to raise the debt ceiling. The next year, President Barack Obama nominated Mr. Powell to the Fed alongside a Democrat, the Harvard economist Jeremy Stein, in a package deal that was meant to attract bipartisan support. Mr. Stein returned to his life as a Harvard professor after two years; Mr. Powell decided he liked working at the Fed, and so he stayed.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/trump-fed-jerome-powell.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'France, Land of Croissants, Finds Butter Vanishing From Shelves', 'text': ' PARIS — It’s hard to imagine a country where butter is taken more seriously than it is in France. It’s a staple of sauces and baking, alike. Without it, the croissant would be a leaden mass of flour, and the jambon-beurre sandwich missing a certain something. The Rouen Cathedral is said to have been built in part on the back of butter fees, and even today, in the western region of Brittany, salted butter is something of a religion. So an empty butter shelf in France is like a dry baguette: deeply disconcerting. But with a slump in European dairy production and a surge in world demand, that is exactly what some French are encountering in their stores. Alarmed by news reports about the shortage, Laurence Meyre, a 53-year-old professor shopping in a supermarket in southern Paris one recent morning, said she had made sure to stock up. \"I thought to myself: Not having butter in France, that’s appalling,\" she said. In truth, the shortages, though noticeable nationwide, have been sporadic, and France gives no appearance of grinding to a halt. But in a country that by some measures consumes more butter per head than anyplace else, that is a fine point. And so French news outlets are giving advice on how to replace butter or to churn your own. One headline asked whether there would be butter for Christmas. The agriculture minister faced questions in Parliament. Online, shoppers shared pictures of empty shelves, and jokers ran fake advertisements offering small amounts of butter for ludicrous prices. Inevitably, a #BeurreGate hashtag popped up. Last year, France consumed about 18 pounds of butter per capita, according to statistics from a coming report by the International Dairy Federation. That is over twice the European Union average, and more than three times the figure in the United States. Gérard Calbrix, the head of economic affairs at the Association of French Dairy Processors, said the industry had been expecting a crunch since spring. \"Over the past year, from June of 2016 to this summer, milk production has fallen in Europe,\" he said. \"At the same time, demand for butter has increased, on all world markets.\" Several factors help explain the mismatch, according to Mr. Calbrix and other analysts. Dairy production in Europe, already falling since European Union milk quotas ended in 2015, slumped after the summer of 2016 because of bad yields from fodder crops and unfavorable weather. Meanwhile, as butter has shed some of its unhealthy image, demand has risen worldwide, especially in the United States — where the fast-food chain McDonald’s promised to put butter back in its recipes last year — and in China. In France alone, butter consumption increased 5 percent from 2013 to 2015, according to a recent report by an umbrella organization for France’s dairy industry, Le Cniel. The result? Butter prices have spiked, rising to nearly $8,000 a ton in September from roughly $2,800 in April 2016. But only France has seen shortages, because of the way its food supply chain is organized. In France, Mr. Calbrix explained, prices between suppliers and big retailers are negotiated once a year, in February. \"The absence of certain products on shelves is an indicator of tensions between some large retailers and their suppliers,\" the Cniel said in its report, noting that many retailers were refusing to pay the increased market price for butter. The government has suggested that fears of a mass shortage are overblown. Stéphane Travert, France’s agriculture minister, acknowledged on Wednesday that pricing disagreements between producers and distributors were keeping butter out of some stores, but he told France Inter radio that \"strictly speaking, there is no shortage.\" Industries that use butter, like bakeries and pastry shops, have had no choice but to pay up and, in some cases, to pass on their increased costs, according to Matthieu Labbé, the managing director for the Federation of Bakery Companies. Could they make do with cheaper substitutes, like margarine? Don’t even think about it. \"There’s no comparison,\" Mr. Labbé said. \"If you want to preserve the quality of our products, you have to use butter — you can’t do anything else.\" Much of the attention over the shortages has focused on France’s butter bastion: Brittany, famous for its crepes and salted-butter caramel. A satirical short film released this month by a collective of local artists imagined, almost presciently, what would happen if the butter ran out. Life in the artists’ butter-deprived Brittany is bleak. Robbers steal it from a restaurant at gunpoint; it is illegally churned by dealers in a motor home, \"Breaking Bad\"-style, for sale on the black market; and the last slice of kouign-amann — a delicacy whose Breton-language name translates as \"butter cake\" — is auctioned off. Reality has not been as dire. For La Trinitaine, a family-run maker of local delicacies in the Morbihan region of southern Brittany, it has been slightly harder and more expensive to secure a steady supply of butter, according to Annabelle Cantin, the company’s head of marketing and communications. \"Butter and salted butter are part of the founding elements for recipes in Brittany,\" she said. \"So yes, we are inevitably affected, and have been for several months now.\" Jean-Robert Pitte, a geographer and gastronomy specialist at the Sorbonne University in Paris, said that France had traditionally been split between a butter-dominated north and an olive oil-using south, but those divisions had broken down. \"When I was little, there was hardly any olive oil in Paris,\" Professor Pitte said. \"Now, we eat butter everywhere, and we consume olive oil everywhere.\" Fernand Point, a revered mid-20th-century chef, famously said, \"Butter! Give me butter! Always butter!\" but Professor Pitte said France had moved past the butter-heavy style of cooking popularized in the United States by Julia Child. It is unclear how long the shortages will linger. The government argues that production traditionally picks up in the winter, but the industry counters that demand also increases toward Christmas. Some shoppers like Ms. Meyre have stockpiled butter, worsening the scarcity. But when she went back to the supermarket several days after doing so, she found the refrigerated butter shelves still half full. \"I’m getting the slight impression that we got scared for nothing,\" Ms. Meyre said. The scare was also an opportunity for laughs. In one Twitter post last week, a dairy plant in the Limousin region of central France warned readers about the dangers of \"beurre-out,\" cautioning that \"margarine is not the solution\" and sharing its phone number as a mock hotline. \"Talk about it with those around you,\" the dairy said. \"And remember to regularly check in on your friends in Brittany.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/france-butter-shortage.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Catalonia Leader Turns Up in Belgium After Spain Seeks Prosecution', 'text': ' BARCELONA, Spain — Hours after the Spanish authorities announced that they would seek to prosecute Catalonia’s separatists for rebellion, Carles Puigdemont, the region’s dismissed leader, turned up on Monday in Belgium, where he may seek asylum. Mr. Puigdemont’s reputation for unpredictability has grown with every turn of Catalonia’s secessionist drama. On Monday, he all but disappeared as the Madrid central government began using emergency laws to take over direct administration of Catalonia after its declaration of independence last week. Speculation had mounted as to what he was up to over the course of the day, until a lawyer in Belgium finally ended the mystery surrounding Mr. Puigdemont’s whereabouts late Monday. \"I have been consulted by Puigdemont and he asked me to protect his interests in the future in Belgium,\" said Paul Bekaert, a Flemish lawyer. Mr. Bekaert said that the two men had met in Belgium and that the conversation was \"about what possibly could come, whatever the Spanish government has ready for him.\" Mr. Bekaert emphasized his \"more than 30 years of experience with extradition and political asylum\" cases, including with Basques who were fighting extradition to Spain to face trial on terrorism charges. Belgium is virtually the only national government in Europe that has been even remotely sympathetic to Mr. Puigdemont’s pleas for mediation, not least perhaps because the country has faced separatist tensions of its own led by Flemish hard-liners. Awkwardly, Brussels is also the headquarters of a European Union bureaucracy that has held the Catalan secessionists at arms’ length, for fear of upsetting Spain, one of the bloc’s largest member states, and stoking forces of fragmentation in other parts of the Continent. On Monday, while there was no official confirmation that Mr. Puigdemont had gone to Brussels, the Belgian and Spanish news media variously suggested that he had arrived for consultations, to seek political asylum, or to even declare a Catalan \"government in exile.\" The speculation kicked into high gear not long after Spain’s attorney general, José Manuel Maza, called around noon in Madrid for the prosecution of Mr. Puigdemont and 19 other Catalan politicians, stopping short of ordering their immediate arrest. Mr. Maza said he wanted the Catalan politicians to appear \"urgently\" in court in Madrid. A decision would be left to Spanish judges whether to charge or jail them. The politicians could face 30 years in prison for the most serious of the potential charges, which included rebellion and sedition. Officially, the Belgian government said it had no knowledge of Mr. Puigdemont’s presence in the country. But the statements of some officials seemed to hint at an openness to accepting Mr. Puigdemont and other Catalan officials if they chose exile. \"It is not unrealistic, if you see the situation at this moment, and the repression from Madrid and the prison sentences with which they are threatening, that the question is whether such a person still has a chance to a fair trial of course,\" Belgium’s migration minister, Theo Francken, told VTM News, a Belgian television station, over the weekend. \"That’s where we enter into a difficult diplomatic situation with the Spanish government,\" he added. Mr. Francken is a member of the New Flemish Alliance party, which favors Flemish independence from the rest of Belgium and has historically had strong links to the Catalan separatists as a kindred movement. This month, members of the alliance hung the Catalan independence flag — the Estelada — in the Belgian Parliament, in a gesture of support. But Belgium’s prime minister, Charles Michel, has dismissed the possibility of granting asylum to Mr. Puigdemont, saying it \"is absolutely not on the agenda\" and called on Mr. Francken \"not to fan the flames.\" Mr. Puigdemont’s arrival presents a direct challenge to Mr. Michel, a Federalist, who as the leader of a delicate government coalition will have to keep separatists in his own government in check while trying to maintain good diplomatic relations with Spain. The Spanish news media had reported that Mr. Puigdemont had left Catalonia with five other deposed members of his cabinet, traveled by car to the southern French city of Marseille, and then by plane to Brussels. In Spain, officials from Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s conservative Popular Party said their priority on Monday was to make sure Mr. Puigdemont did not try to stay in office, by insisting he remained leader of Catalonia, rather than worry about him escaping the country. Fernando Martínez-Maíllo, a senior Popular Party official, characterized Mr. Puigdemont’s departure as \"a desperate act.\" Albert Rivera, the leader of the Ciudadanos party, which is strongly opposed to secession, accused Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist leadership of \"fleeing the country\" while leaving his Catalan civil servants to resist and continue to break Spanish law. Indeed, the forcible steps by the central government have now left Catalan civil servants and politicians with the painful choice of sticking to their secessionist plans and defying Madrid’s direct administration or facing the potential of criminal charges. Not least, there was the important decision for separatist parties about whether to take part in regional elections called by Madrid or to risk sidelining themselves. The two main Catalan parties — including Mr. Puigdemont’s Catalan European Democratic Party — said on Monday they would run in the elections, which are scheduled for Dec. 21, although perhaps no longer as part of the coalition that won the most parliamentary seats in 2015. Germà Bel, a separatist Catalan lawmaker, said Mr. Puigdemont’s possible hopes of running a government from exile was \"symbolic.\" \"I don’t know of anyone who’s run a government from overseas,\" he said. \"Even Charles de Gaulle didn’t run a government from overseas.\" But he argued that it would be hard for Mr. Rajoy’s government to maintain control over Catalonia for an extended period. The decision by pro-independence parties to take part in the December elections meant that they \"at least implicitly\" accept they are still part of Spain — no small concession. \"This election has been called by the Spanish government under Spanish law — and it will be an election run within the state,\" Mr. Bel said. With the emergency measures taken over the weekend, Mr. Rajoy opted not to appoint a caretaker leader of Catalonia. Instead, the country’s deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, took over the management of the Catalan administration from Madrid, and dispatched a senior central government official to Barcelona on Monday. Juan Ignacio Zoido, the Spanish interior minister, said on Monday that the takeover of the Catalan police force, known as the Mossos, had gone smoothly. He fired the Mossos police chief, Josep Lluís Trapero, over the weekend and appointed the deputy leader of the force, Ferran López, to the post. Under the emergency measures allowed by Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, the provision invoked by Mr. Rajoy to take control of Catalonia, the national government could replace the 17,000 officers of the Mossos with Spanish police officers. But Mr. Zoido said that \"at no point did we consider eliminating the Mossos police corps.\" Mr. Zoido called on separatist leaders to remove their personal belongings from their offices on Monday and to leave, focusing solely on preparing for the December elections, as candidates. At least one member of Mr. Puigdemont’s ousted cabinet, Josep Rull, defiantly went to work Monday morning, after the region’s president sent a message over the weekend urging Catalans to peacefully oppose Madrid’s takeover and the removal of a democratically elected regional government. After spending one hour in his office, Mr. Rull, the Catalan minister for planning and sustainability, left in a waiting car, but without his police detail, telling reporters that he had not removed his belongings from his office. \"Today I came to my office to carry out the work that the Catalan people entrusted to us,\" he said. \"And now I will continue, normally, with my agenda.\" The possibility that separatist leaders might be charged with rebellion has prompted a major dispute among Spanish lawyers. Diego López Garrido, who drafted changes to the Spanish legal code relating to rebellion, told Antena 3 that \"in my judgment, there is no crime of rebellion because no violence has been produced.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/Carlos-puigdemont-Belgium-Spain.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Who Betrayed Anne Frank? Former F.B.I. Agent Reopens a Cold Case', 'text': ' AMSTERDAM — Hiding from the Gestapo in a secret annex of her father’s warehouse in Amsterdam during World War II, Anne Frank heard a little knock on the wall. She could not be sure who or what it was, and it frightened her. She was right to be scared: Just months later, on Aug. 4, 1944, the police discovered the hide-out during a raid and arrested her and seven others living behind a movable bookcase. All but Otto Frank, the diarist’s father, and later the editor of \"The Diary of a Young Girl,\" perished in Nazi death camps. Who gave them up has remained a mystery. Now, almost 75 years later, a team of experts led by a retired F.B.I. agent is bringing modern forensic science and criminology to bear in hopes of solving one of history’s most famous cold case files. \"We will put special emphasis on new leads,\" said the retired special agent, Vince Pankoke, 59, who is leading the effort. \"We need to verify stories as they come in, and we know that is going to lead to further investigation.\" In the search for new leads, he and his team are digitally combing through millions of pages of scanned material from the National Archives in Washington as well as archives in the Netherlands, Germany and Israel. The use of other modern techniques like forensic accounting, crowd sourcing, behavioral science and testimonial reconstruction may also hold promise of a breakthrough. The team, for example, is carrying out a three-dimensional scan of the original house and using computer models to determine how far sounds might have traveled. Those techniques may allow them to re-evaluate old evidence — for instance, whether the knock on the wall, described in Anne Frank’s diary, was someone telling those hiding that they were being too loud, or whether it could have been a trap. Such modern and expensive techniques were not available to the Dutch national police when they unsuccessfully investigated the case in 1948 and again in 1963. Much is known about Anne Frank’s life during her two years in hiding, thanks both to her famous diary and the accounts of helpers and friends published after the war. But far less is known about the circumstances surrounding the raid on Aug. 4, 1944. The raid ended her time in the house on the Prinsengracht and precipitated her long and torturous journey to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she is believed to have died in February 1945. In a country from which an estimated 108,000 Jews were deported — of whom only about 5,500 returned — the reopening of the case is also part of a larger national conversation. \"She used to be the girl that we protected and now she has become the girl that we betrayed,\" said Bart van der Boom, an expert on the Nazi occupation and a lecturer at Leiden University. \"It’s a function of how the Dutch perceive themselves during the occupation.\" That perception changed in the 1960s, said Dr. van der Boom, when the Dutch started to question the traditional narrative that all Dutch people were victims of the Nazis. The Dutch Resistance Museum in Amsterdam, for example, now features a narrative thread describing the life of a collaborator, as well as ones about people who stayed neutral, those who resisted and those who were victimized. At least 28,000 Jews hid from the Germans during the four-year occupation of the Netherlands, Dr. van de Boom said. Of those, roughly a third were caught, the vast majority because of the efforts of a small band of paid collaborators known in Dutch as \"Jodenjagers,\" or Jew hunters, he said. \"We don’t know what happened exactly on that fateful day, and there is something intriguing about an open end in a narrative,\" said Ronald Leopold, the executive director of the Anne Frank House foundation, which runs the museum and conducts research into her life and death. \"Betrayers did not have the classical image we have of perpetrator, those uniformed faces of death,\" Mr. Leopold said. The figure of the betrayer is important in the life of Anne Frank because, unlike the police and soldiers who would be responsible for her death, the betrayer was possibly known by the Frank family, and almost certainly was not someone wearing an official uniform. The list of possible subjects has been growing as researchers have proposed new names and theories. While Wilhelm van Maaren, a warehouse foreman, was the primary focus in both Dutch police investigations, the new investigation is open to all possibilities. \"When Otto Frank returned, in the summer of 1945, he assumed someone gave them up,\" said Gertjan Broek, a senior historian at the Anne Frank House, which receives 1.3 million visitors a year. \"It’s always been a firmly held belief.\" But while the idea that the police were tipped off has long been part of the Anne Frank story, not everyone is convinced that betrayal necessarily played a role. Dr. Broek published a 37-page report in December proposing the theory that the police were at the address on another mission, and found the lodgers only by chance. Researchers in the Netherlands have welcomed the new investigation, and Dr. Broek is serving as one of its advisers. \"What is new about this one is that it looks at the case with forensic eyes,\" Mr. Leopold said. \"And we look forward to the results.\" The investigative team — which also includes Roger Depue, a retired F.B.I. behavioral scientist, among its 20 members and consultants — hopes to reveal its progress on Aug. 4, 2019, exactly 75 years after the raid. Thijs Bayens, an organizer of the investigation and a filmmaker who plans to make a documentary about it, said the cost of the work would run into six digits, and the group is collecting donations on its website. Mr. Pankoke is keeping a diary of the investigation on the group’s website. During his 27-year career, Mr. Pankoke said, he worked on a squad aimed at Colombian drug traffickers in the 1990s and investigated the cellphone communications of the Sept. 11 hijackers. Working in an undercover unit, he played the part of a financier to investigate crimes on Wall Street. The new team has made progress already, Mr. Pankoke said. Someone claiming to be a neighbor of the now-famous annex left information on the investigators’ tip page that pointed to another nearby resident as having collaborated with Nazis. Mr. Pankoke said his team would follow up. He said he hoped that reopening the case would reawaken people’s awareness of the Holocaust, memories of which he fears are receding in an era of genocides and other atrocities. \"Part of the story is being lost to the sands of time,\" Mr. Pankoke said. \"If we accomplish nothing else — and I’m certain we will, I have a great team — we are bringing attention to the issue.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/anne-frank-cold-case-investigation.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'New Accusers Expand Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Claims Back to ’70s', 'text': ' Hope Exiner d’Amore said Harvey Weinstein raped her in a hotel room in the 1970s, when he was a young concert promoter in Buffalo.

Together, the accounts provide a widening tally of alleged abuses, and illustrate the toll on women who say they felt ashamed and isolated as they watched the Hollywood producer walk red carpets, pile up Oscars and showcase his ties to prominent figures. \"This has haunted me my entire life,\" said Ms. Exiner d’Amore, now 62, who was in her early 20s at the time of the alleged rape. She and three other women who spoke to The Times described Mr. Weinstein as inappropriate and unrelenting. Some said that he used the pretext of work to lure them to hotels, that he touched them or forced them into unwanted sexual activity and that he wouldn’t stop when they said no. Ms. Matthau, the dancer who reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, said she was willing to break its confidentiality clause even if it meant that he might pursue legal damages. \"I want to do my part to help bring this to light so it doesn’t happen with other people in Hollywood or anywhere else,\" she said in an interview. The allegations add to those previously documented in The Times, The New Yorker and elsewhere. Last week, the actress Dominique Huett filed a lawsuit claiming that in 2010, Mr. Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. The same day, Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant of Mr. Weinstein’s, appeared at a news conference in New York accusing him of the same behavior in 2006. The New York Police Department is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of allegations against Mr. Weinstein. Detectives with expertise in old cases are reviewing complaints that have come through the department’s hotline, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In New York, the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other sex crimes depends on the force alleged and the charges considered, but it can range from two years to no time restrictions for the most serious offenses. Ms. Burr, the woman involved in the hallway encounter in the 1970s, said that she contacted the New York police in recent weeks and that they told her the alleged assault had happened too long ago to be prosecuted. Women have also spoken to law enforcement authorities in London, Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States. The London police are investigating three sexual assault cases involving Mr. Weinstein, ranging from the 1980s to 2015. Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement that \"any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.\" For 40 years, Cynthia Burr has almost never talked about the time she met Mr. Weinstein. But she didn’t forget how he greeted her in the lobby of a beautiful old building in New York City. How he tried to kiss her in the elevator. And how, she said, he unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway. \"It was just him and me alone,\" she said. \"I was fearful I didn’t have the wherewithal to get away.\" It was the late 1970s, and Ms. Burr was an actress in her early 20s. Mr. Weinstein was in his mid-20s and a \"real up-and-comer,\" Ms. Burr remembers. Her manager said they should meet. After the encounter, she recalls feeling ashamed. \"The way he forced me made me feel really bad about myself,\" she said. \"What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress? Nobody would have believed me.\" Ms. Burr, now 62, went on to build a career in Hollywood. She appeared in \"Scarface\" and the first two \"Lethal Weapon\" films, and in soap operas and other television shows. Eventually, she told her husband, now deceased, and a close friend, Lee Chavez, what had happened. Mr. Chavez confirmed that she had told him her account about 10 years ago. \"I’m really sad for everybody, but I’m really glad it’s out in the open,\" Ms. Burr said about learning of the other allegations against Mr. Weinstein. \"I finally felt like I had a voice.\" Ms. Exiner d’Amore had worked for Mr. Weinstein for just a few weeks when he asked if she’d like to take a trip to New York City. Both of them were in their 20s, living in Buffalo in the late 1970s. She was working for Mr. Weinstein’s concert promotion company, Harvey and Corky Productions, doing odd jobs. She was interested in film, so when Mr. Weinstein asked if she wanted to come to New York City to meet with people in the industry, she agreed. When they got to the Park Lane Hotel, Mr. Weinstein went to the check-in desk while she waited elsewhere in the lobby, Ms. Exiner d’Amore recalled. He returned and said there had been a mistake with the reservations; there was only one room. They would have to share. \"I gave him a look like that was ridiculous,\" she recalled. But she ultimately agreed, assuming it was harmless. When she got into bed that night, she said, he slipped in next to her, naked. \"I told him no. I kept pushing him away. He just wouldn’t listen,\" Ms. Exiner d’Amore said. \"He just forced himself on me.\" She said he forcibly performed oral sex and intercourse on her. She did not tell her boyfriend, feeling ashamed, but she did confide in her next-door neighbors in Buffalo. She did not specifically say she was raped, but the couple, David and Irene Sipos, told The Times that they remembered her being extremely upset and crying when she told them about Mr. Weinstein and the hotel room. After the trip, Ms. Exiner d’Amore said, Mr. Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her credit cards to go on shopping sprees. She declined. Within three or four weeks, she was fired. \"It was a relief,\" she said. \"I hated being there.\" Ms. Exiner d’Amore never went into the film industry. She got a job administering an undergraduate program at Cornell, and later moved on to jobs in fund-raising. Ashley Matthau said that Mr. Weinstein was aggressive with her the moment they met in 2004. She was in Puerto Rico performing in \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\" when Mr. Weinstein visited the set. As soon as he saw her, she said, he began pressuring her to come to his hotel room for a private meeting. Ms. Matthau, who then went by her maiden name, Anderson, said she tried to brush him off, explaining that she was engaged. She said he persisted. When the cast broke for a meal, Ms. Matthau told some production members that Mr. Weinstein was being pushy and she was afraid. No one offered to help, she said, and when she returned to the set, Mr. Weinstein instructed her to get into a car. \"‘Don’t worry,’\" Ms. Matthau, now 36, remembers him saying as they sat in the back seat. \"‘Nothing is going to happen. We’re just going to discuss future projects.’\" She said they went to his hotel room, where talk quickly became sexual: Mr. Weinstein told her that he had helped launch the careers of high-profile actresses who had slept with him, and that she should consider doing the same. When she declined, Mr. Weinstein pushed her onto the bed and fondled her breasts, she said. He then stripped, straddled her and masturbated on top of her. \"I kept telling him, ‘Stop, I’m engaged,’ but he kept saying: ‘It’s just a little cuddling. It’s not a problem. It’s not like we’re having sex.’ \" Back in California days later, Ms. Matthau tearfully told her fiancé, Charles Matthau, a general description of what had happened. Mr. Matthau said in an interview that he was outraged. With his encouragement, Ms. Matthau retained John S. West, a partner in the law firm of Gloria Allred, who has a record of taking on powerful men. Soon, Ms. Matthau recalled, she and Mr. West met at the Peninsula Beverly Hills with Mr. Weinstein and Daniel M. Petrocelli, who had represented high-profile clients including Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron. The experience, she said, was chilling. She had attended a couple of parties at the Playboy Mansion, and Mr. Petrocelli said she would be painted as promiscuous if she went public with her accusation against Mr. Weinstein. \"‘We’ll drag you through the mud by your hair,’\" she recalled the lawyer saying. Mr. Petrocelli declined to comment. Going up against such powerful men felt like more than she could handle. Ms. Matthau said she agreed to enter into a more than $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in exchange for a legally binding promise never to speak of the allegations again. Lacey Dorn moved to New York City in 2011, soon after graduating from Stanford University, where she had helped create two documentaries. Ms. Dorn, then 22, was introduced to Mr. Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party A few weeks later, Ms. Dorn attended a Halloween party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and ran into Mr. Weinstein, who asked for her email. He wanted to talk about her career over lunch, she said. \"Great meeting you,\" he wrote in the subject line of an otherwise blank email sent to her at 12:26 a.m. On her way out of the party, Ms. Dorn said goodbye to Mr. Weinstein. As she turned her back to him, he grabbed between her legs, touching her buttocks and crotch through her clothes. \"I was so naïve, I didn’t say anything. And he didn’t say anything either,\" she said. \"I just got out of the party as fast as possible.\" Ms. Dorn said she never heard from Mr. Weinstein and never spoke to him again. Ms. Dorn said that when she told friends what had happened, many seemed to shrug it off as if it were a \"rite of passage,\" an acknowledgment of how \"awful\" the entertainment business could be.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-allegations.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Two New York Detectives Are Charged With Rape and Kidnapping', 'text': ' Minutes after two New York detectives stopped an 18-year-old Brooklyn woman last month for having marijuana in her car, they placed her into handcuffs and put her into their police van, prosecutors said. Describing himself and his partner as \"freaks,\" one of the detectives forced the young woman to perform oral sex on him and raped her, prosecutors said, switching places within moments to let the other assault her, too. This chilling account was offered in court on Monday morning as the Brooklyn district attorney’s office unsealed a 50-count indictment against the detectives, Edward Martins and Richard Hall, charging them with rape, kidnapping and official misconduct. The indictment marked the district attorney’s office’s first formal statement on the allegations, details of which have been emerging in the news media for weeks. Detective Hall, 33, and Detective Martins, 37, surrendered on Monday at the 94th Precinct station house in Williamsburg. At their arraignment in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, both pleaded not guilty and were released on bail. Their lawyers vowed to vigorously fight the charges, arguing that prosecutors had given too much credence to the woman’s \"uncorroborated\" claims and suggesting that the encounter was consensual. Even in a city that has seen its share of police corruption — from the systemic graft revealed by Frank Serpico in 1970s to the brutal attack of Abner Louima, who was sexually assaulted in 1997 by an officer wielding a broomstick — the allegations against Detectives Hall and Martins were remarkable for both the viciousness of the crimes and the raw abuse of power. Typically, when officers are charged with crimes, their colleagues come to court in a sea of blue uniforms to support them. But on Monday, not one officer appeared in court with Detectives Martins and Hall. According to a detailed account delivered by a prosecutor, Frank DeGaetano, the incident occurred on Sept. 15, when Detectives Hall and Martins were conducting operations in the Coney Island neighborhood as part of an antidrug unit, Brooklyn South Narcotics. Around 8 p.m., Mr. DeGaetano said, the detectives broke off from the rest of their team and stopped an Infinity coupe in Calvert Vaux Park. The 18-year-old woman was driving, he said; two of her friends, both men, were also in the car. As the detectives — both in plainclothes — approached the car, one of them shined his flashlight through the window and saw the young woman adjusting her bra. When Detective Hall asked if she was hiding something, she told him she was simply adjusting her nipple piercing, Mr. DeGaetano said. The detectives asked her to prove it, and the young woman lifted up her shirt, showing them her breasts. A search of the car revealed a small amount of marijuana in a cup holder. The woman also had some marijuana and a few pills of Klonopin, an anti-anxiety drug, in her handbag, Mr. DeGaetano said. At that point, he added, the detectives took the woman from the car, placed her in handcuffs and put her into the second row of their Dodge police van. Driving off, they told her that she would be released within a few hours at the 60th Precinct station house. Mr. DeGaetano said that Detective Martins used his cellphone to call the woman’s friends and explicitly instructed them not to follow the van, using a blocking function to disguise the number he was calling from. It was then that Detective Martins sat down next to the woman and said that he and his partner were \"freaks,\" asking her what she wanted to do to avoid being arrested, Mr. DeGaetano said. After tightening the handcuffs, Detective Martins pulled out his penis and forced the woman to perform oral sex on him, Mr. DeGaetano said. Then he turned her around, pulled her pants down and raped her, Mr. DeGaetano added, as Detective Hall watched through the rearview mirror and the young woman cried and pleaded with Detective Martins to stop. By that point, Mr. DeGaetano said, the van was in Bay Ridge, at least four miles from where the antidrug team had been working. Mr. DeGaetano said that Detective Hall switched places with his partner and also forced the woman to perform oral sex on him. After the attack, Mr. DeGaetano said, the detectives returned to Coney Island and dropped the woman off about five blocks from their station house. Before she left, they made her take one of her Klonopin pills and told her to \"keep her mouth shut,\" Mr. DeGaetano said. Within days, the city medical examiner’s office had analyzed a rape test performed on the woman and determined that it contained samples of both detectives’ sperm, Mr. DeGaetano said. \"These are extremely serious charges,\" he added, saying that each could face up to 25 years in prison. Detective Martins, who joined the Police Department in July 2006, had his bail set at $250,000, and Detective Hall, who joined in July 2010, had his bail set at $150,000. Both were suspended and demoted on Friday, after the grand jury handed up the indictment. Even with physical evidence like DNA, rape prosecutions are often difficult. A court document filed on Monday hinted at some of the vulnerabilities defense lawyers may seek to exploit. One day after the encounter, investigators from the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau interviewed her and found she that while she could identify Detective Hall from a photo array, she was unable to identify Detective Martins, according to the court document. The document also showed that her two friends were also unable to identify Detective Martins and that one of them misidentified Detective Hall. Calling the indictment \"schizophrenic,\" John Arlia, a lawyer for Detective Hall, noted at the arraignment that the charges included accusations of both \"forcible\" rape and of using sex to bribe a police officer — a \"self-contradictory\" position, suggesting that the prosecutors had two theories of the case and were not entirely confident about the young woman’s account. Mark A. Bederow, Detective Martins’s lawyer, said his client had been subjected for weeks to a \"circus\" of allegations made in the media by the young woman’s lawyer, Michael David. Mr. Bederow called the woman’s account \"uncorroborated.\" He told Justice Danny K. Chun, who is handling the case, that while prosecutors had furnished DNA evidence, they had not provided surveillance footage connected to the attack, which allegedly took place in the parking lot of a Chipotle restaurant, nor of the detectives releasing the woman near the station house. Mr. Bederow added that he had \"substantial information\" that would undermine her story, suggesting that she had a \"financial\" motive to lie about the attack. At a news conference after the arraignment, Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney, asked anyone who may have had similar encounters with the detectives to come forward. He also condemned the detectives’ lawyers for attacking the victim. \"It is shocking and unfortunate that they would blame a teenager for the acts of their clients,\" Mr. Gonzalez said. \"To think that these are grown men in a position of power over an 18-year-old, and for them to blame her, is ridiculous and demeaning. To my mind it speaks to desperation.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/nypd-detectives-rape-kidnapping-charges.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Dennis Banks, American Indian Civil Rights Leader, Dies at 80', 'text': ' Dennis J. Banks, the militant Chippewa who founded the American Indian Movement in 1968 and led often-violent insurrections to protest the treatment of Native Americans and the nation’s history of injustices against its indigenous peoples, died on Sunday night at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He was 80. His daughter Tashina Banks Rama said the cause was complications of pneumonia following successful open-heart surgery a week ago at the clinic. Mr. Banks lived on the Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota, where he was born and where he grew up. Mr. Banks and his Oglala Sioux compatriot Russell Means were by the mid-1970s perhaps the nation’s best-known Native Americans since Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, who led the attack that crushed the cavalry forces of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Montana Territory in 1876. Mr. Banks, whose early life of poverty, alcoholism and alienation mirrored the fates of countless ancestors, led protests that caused mass disorder, shootouts, deaths and grievous injuries. He was jailed for burglary and convicted of riot and assault, and he became a fugitive for nine years. He found sanctuary in California and New York but finally gave up and was imprisoned for 14 months. He once led a six-day takeover of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, and mounted an armed 71-day occupation of the town of Wounded Knee, S.D., on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Wounded Knee was the scene of the last major conflict of the American Indian Wars, in which 350 Lakota men, women and children were massacred by United States troops in 1890. While his protests won some government concessions and drew national attention and wide sympathy for the deplorable social and economic conditions of American Indians, Mr. Banks achieved few real improvements in the daily lives of millions of Native Americans, who live on reservations and in major cities and lag behind most fellow citizens in jobs, housing and education. To admirers, Mr. Banks was a broad-chested champion of native pride. With dark, piercing eyes, high cheekbones, a jutting chin and long raven hair, he was a paladin who defied authority and, in an era crowded with civil rights protests, spoke for the nation’s oldest minority. To his critics, including many American Indians, Mr. Banks was a self-promoter, grabbing headlines and becoming a darling of politically liberal Hollywood stars like Jane Fonda and Marlon Brando. His severest detractors, including law-enforcement officials, said he let followers risk injury and arrest while he jumped bail to avoid a long prison sentence and did not surrender for nearly a decade. Mr. Banks and Mr. Means first won national attention for declaring a \"Day of Mourning\" for Native Americans on Thanksgiving Day in 1970. Their band seized the ship Mayflower II, a replica of the original in Plymouth, Mass., and a televised confrontation between real Indians and costumed \"Pilgrims\" made the American Indian Movement leaders overnight heroes. In 1972, the two organized cross-country car caravans on \"Trails of Broken Treaties.\" They converged on Washington with 500 followers to protest Indian living standards and lost treaty rights, occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs and held out for nearly a week, destroying documents and the premises, until the government agreed to discuss Indian grievances and review treaty commitments. In 1973, after a white man killed an Indian in a saloon brawl and was charged not with murder but with involuntary manslaughter, Mr. Banks led 200 American Indian Movement protesters in a face-off with the police in Custer, S.D. It became a riot when the slain man’s mother was beaten by officers. After he left town, Mr. Banks, who said he had merely tried to ease tensions, was charged with assault and rioting. It was the last straw. \"We had reached a point in history where we could not tolerate the abuse any longer, where mothers could not tolerate the mistreatment that goes on on the reservations any longer, where they could not see another Indian youngster die,\" he told the author Peter Matthiessen. Weeks later, the siege that made Mr. Banks and Mr. Means famous across America began when 200 Oglala Lakota and A.I.M. followers with rifles and shotguns occupied Wounded Knee. About 300 United States marshals, F.B.I. agents and other law-enforcement officials cordoned off the area with armored cars and heavy weapons, touching off a 10-week battle of nerves and gunfire. Amid wide news media coverage, the significance of the battlefield was not lost on many Americans. Dee Brown’s best-selling book \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West\" (1970) had recently explored the record of massacres and atrocities against Native Americans on the expanding frontier, undermining one of the nation’s fondest myths. Proclaiming a willingness to die for their cause, Mr. Banks and Mr. Means demanded the ouster of Richard Wilson, the elected leader of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council, whom they called a corrupt white man’s stooge. The government refused. Shootings punctuated the days of stalemate, leaving wounded on both sides. Two Indians were killed, and a federal agent was shot and paralyzed. When it was over, Mr. Banks and Mr. Means were charged with assault and conspiracy. After a federal trial, with the defense raising historic and current Indian grievances, a judge dismissed the case for prosecutorial misconduct, including illegal wiretaps and evidence that had been tampered with. By then, Mr. Banks was a pre-eminent spokesman for Native Americans. He mediated armed conflicts between Indians and the authorities in various states. But his own legal troubles were not over. Charged with riot and assault with a deadly weapon for his role in the 1973 melee in Custer, he was found guilty in 1975. Facing up to 15 years in prison, he jumped bail and fled to California. With 1.4 million signatures on a petition supporting Mr. Banks, Gov. Jerry Brown granted him asylum in 1976, rejecting extradition to South Dakota by saying his life might be in danger if he were sent back. Mr. Banks later became chancellor of Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University, a small two-year college for Indians in Davis, Calif. Deprived of California sanctuary when Governor Brown was succeeded by a Republican, George Deukmejian, in early 1983, Mr. Banks found a new refuge on an Onondaga reservation near Syracuse. Federal officials said he would be arrested only if he left the reservation. But in 1984, weary of his confined life, he returned to South Dakota voluntarily and was sentenced to three years in prison. Paroled in 1985 after serving only 14 months, he moved to the Pine Ridge Reservation to work as a drug addiction and alcoholism counselor. He also turned his life around, embracing sobriety, giving talks on public service and organizing cross-country events that he called Sacred Runs, which became popular among supporters of Native Americans in later years. \"We were the prophets, the messengers, the fire starters,\" Mr. Banks said in an autobiography, \"Ojibwa Warrior: Dennis Banks and the Rise of the American Indian Movement\" (2005, with Richard Erdoes). \"Wounded Knee awakened not only the conscience of all Native Americans, but also of white Americans nationwide.\" Dennis James Banks was born on the Leech Lake Reservation on April 12, 1937. He never knew his father. His mother abandoned him to his grandparents. When he was 5, he was taken from his family and sent to a series of government schools for Indians that systematically denigrated his Ojibwa (Chippewa) culture, language and identity. He ran away often, until, at 17, he returned to Leech Lake. Unable to find work, he joined the Air Force and was stationed in Japan, where he married a Japanese woman, had a child with her and went absent without leave. Arrested and returned to the United States, he never saw his wife or child again. After being discharged, he moved to Minneapolis, drifted into crime, was arrested in a burglary and went to jail for two and a half years. Released in 1968, he founded the American Indian Movement with an Ojibwa he had met in prison, Clyde Bellecourt, and others to fight the oppression and endemic poverty of Native Americans. He became chairman and national director as the group, based in Minneapolis, forged alliances and grew rapidly. After two years it said it had 25,000 members. Within a year A.I.M., with its flair for guerrilla tactics, joined a lengthy occupation of Alcatraz Island, the former federal prison site in San Francisco Bay. After his fugitive years, Mr. Banks had a modest movie career. He had roles in Franc Roddam’s \"War Party\" (1988), Michael Apted’s \"Thunderheart\" (1992), Michael Mann’s \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1992, with Russell Means), and Georgina Lightning’s \"Older Than America\" (2008), which explored the devastating effects of Indian boarding schools like those Mr. Banks had been forced to attend. Mr. Banks also appeared in documentaries: \"We Shall Remain, Part V: Wounded Knee\" (2009), a Ric Burns \"American Experience\" television film directed by Stanley Nelson; \"A Good Day to Die\" (2010), directed by David Mueller and Lynn Salt; and \"Nowa Cumig: The Drum Will Never Stop\" (2011), directed by Marie-Michele Jasmin-Belisle. Besides his wife and child in Japan, Mr. Banks had many children with other women. In addition to Ms. Banks Rama, he is survived by 19 children, 11 with the surname Banks: Janice, Darla, Deanna, Dennis, Red Elk, Tatanka, Minoh, Tokala, Tiopa, Tacanunpa and Arrow. The others are Glenda Roberts, Beverly Baribeau, Kevin Strong, D. J. Nelson-Banks, Bryan Graves, and Pearl, Denise and Kawlija Blanchard. Mr. Banks is also survived by more than 100 grandchildren, Ms. Banks Rama said. Mr. Banks was the 2016 vice presidential nominee of the California Peace and Freedom Party, which identified itself as socialist and feminist. The party’s presidential candidate was Gloria La Riva. As a single-state ticket, they won 66,000 votes. In recent years, Mr. Banks lived with some of his children in Kentucky and Minnesota. He was an honorary trustee of the Leech Lake Tribal College, a two-year public institution in Cass Lake, Minn. Mr. Means, who also appeared in movies and wrote a memoir, died on the Pine Ridge Reservation in 2012 at age 72. In 1990, both men joined a ceremony at the Pine Ridge Reservation commemorating the centenary of the Wounded Knee massacre. \"Maybe we opened up some eyes, opened some doors,\" Mr. Banks told The Los Angeles Times. \"And it was at least an educational process here. Fifteen years ago, there was no newspaper here, no radio station. Now there’s more community control over education.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/obituaries/dennis-banks-dead-american-indians.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'At 100, Thelonious Monk Gets a Hero’s Celebration', 'text': ' DURHAM, N.C. — In some sense, Thelonious Monk’s songs present the jazz musician’s perfect challenge. They’re opaque, lumbering and miraculously catchy. Played right, each passing harmony feels rich enough to last an entire song. But if you can’t make these pieces move — get them feeling spry, almost balletic — you’ve lost the battle. On the final two nights of a 10-day festival here celebrating Monk’s 100th birthday, two of today’s great tenor saxophonists put their hands on his music. From very different angles, they showed what makes him jazz’s most popular composer to cover, and one of its most difficult. The context was the same for Joshua Redman on Wednesday as it was for Ravi Coltrane on Thursday: They were backed by a standard jazz trio led by the pianist Ethan Iverson as they played tight renditions of classic Monk repertoire. But while Mr. Redman soloed with a smokestack effusiveness, getting underneath the melodies and setting them alight, Mr. Coltrane’s horn was liquid. It seemed to move freely on its own, as if any expansion or turn was coming directly from the notes themselves. The festival, Monk@100, was produced by Duke University, and studiously programmed by Mr. Iverson and Aaron Greenwald, the director of Duke Performances. It was the highest-profile and probably the most far-reaching of the many Monk tributes happening this year, and it attested to the durability of Monk’s influence, even at a time when consensus in jazz has grown rare. The major focus, perhaps inevitably, was on Monk’s pen. The 60-plus tunes he is known to have written are some of the most beloved pieces in jazz’s canon, partly because they live just barely outside of its conventional language. That’s what the daytime show on Oct. 21 was about, when five pianists took turns playing solo and duo renditions of almost every work Monk wrote. The same applied for the performances of the J.D. Allen Trio, which worked with a different guest each of the festival’s first three nights. But it went beyond that. On Oct. 20, the pianist Jason Moran came together in a duo with the drummer and multi-instrumentalist Tyshawn Sorey. (I wasn’t in town for this part of the festival but was able to watch video shot by a film crew documenting the entire event. That footage may someday be public.) Their first set began with a loose reading of the ruminative melody to \"Monk’s Mood\" and ventured quickly into abstraction, dispatching with the standard ideas of what it takes to interpret Monk’s music. This set was one of the moments when the spirit of Monk’s piano playing got called up and shocked back to life in the air of the present day. This came naturally through Mr. Moran’s fingers and his memory. He grew up idolizing Monk and reworked Monk’s language of halting gestures and piquant dissonance, eventually rendering his own approach. Playing with Mr. Sorey here, he often reduced Monk’s song themes to scaffolds and wisps; his own chiming, splintery swing feels attested to Monk’s long shadow, even in a context dominated by free improvisation. \"I didn’t learn what the normal way is to do things: Monk is my normal way to do things,\" Mr. Moran said after the festival, describing his formative years. \"When that’s the bar that you pull against, you already know certain things about how the body works with the piano, how important dance is to a song, how great swing feels at a medium tempo if you’re doing it right.\" Starting in the early 1940s, Monk became a major architect of the style known as bebop — and, immediately, an iconoclast within it. He helped devise its language of thick harmonies, zipping melodies and steamed-up rhythm. But Monk maintained a rough piano style and wrote tunes to reflect it; his virtuosity worked on a level that was more tonal, and more physical. (In Monk’s musical manuscripts, which Mr. Iverson discovered on eBay and posted to his personal blog, he even invents a more evocative way of spelling a bell sound: \"Tding tding tding.\") Rather than dashing futurism, his bebop was about arrangement and choreography. Each note in his compositions sounds like a weight-bearing limb, supporting the body of the song and leading into the next movement. And those limbs often pause to hold a pose: On a simple, singsong piece like \"Rhythm-a-Ning\" or a wound-up work like \"Criss Cross,\" he uses silence more than speed. \"There are few artists that everyone would have such a uniform agreement on: ‘Yes, let’s check out this repertoire,’\" Mr. Iverson said in an interview Thursday. \"Everyone that has come down to do this festival has been like, ‘Oh yeah, I’d like to study some Monk.’ Everybody is excited and sometimes a little daunted by trying to play the songs right, trying to have a personal opinion.\" A hundred years after Monk’s birth, on Oct. 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, N.C., roughly 60 miles east of Durham, we’re deep into something like the post-history of jazz — at least as a definable style and a set of universal touchstones. New ensembles rarely spend much time on standard repertoire, and most mainline jazz is growing from the conservatory and the composer’s mind, not the fertile space of jam sessions. (Monk first developed a following as the house pianist at Minton’s, the Harlem club whose jam sessions in the ’40s incubated bebop.) To be an improvising musician nowadays almost always means writing your own textbook, often with source material from outside the blues and jazz tradition. Still, learning to play Monk’s music remains an almost unavoidable rite of passage. He is one of many jazz luminaries whose 100th birthdays fall this year, including Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and Buddy Rich, but his has seemed to matter the most. Festivals well beyond Durham programmed tribute content this year. The Jazz Standard in Manhattan devoted three weeks to consecutive Monk-related shows, from vastly disparate artists. Even Jazz at Lincoln Center, whose most intimate stage, Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, is named for Gillespie, devoted more programming this month to Monk. (Gillespie’s birthday was on Oct. 21.) A host of albums have come out reinterrogating Monk’s compositions. At Durham Fruit and Produce Company, an old warehouse that has recently been retrofitted as a small performing arts venue, sculptural work by the North Carolina-based artist André Leon Gray was installed throughout the building: near the entrance, an altar with accouterments to Monk; down the hall, an image of the pianist’s silhouette inscribed with his catchphrase, \"Always know;\" onstage, a tar painting of Monk’s face, surrounded by black and white keys arranged in a loose asymmetry. And in the lobby, just beside the makeshift bar, there was a listening station with some turntables set up. Vinyl copies of Monk’s full discography were available for attendees to spin. The afternoon before the festival’s final show, when Mr. Coltrane performed with Mr. Iverson’s trio, I sat down and cued up \"Monk’s Music,\" the classic septet recording from 1957. (A young John Coltrane, Ravi’s father, appears on the album.) The festival’s live proceedings seemed to defend jazz’s old idea that the onstage ritual can encompass both veneration and invention. And then there was the listening station: a reminder that the old texts remain. In a time of postmodern splay, Monk is here to stay.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/music/thelonious-monk-centennial-festival.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Reading by the Numbers: When Big Data Meets Literature', 'text': ' The history of literary criticism is filled with would-be revolutionaries. But few have issued as radical a cry as Franco Moretti, the professor famous for urging his colleagues to stop reading books. Most literary criticism is grounded in close reading, with scholars poring over individual texts to tease out subtle meanings. But to truly grasp the laws of literature, Mr. Moretti has argued in a series of polemics, requires \"distant reading\": the computer-assisted crunching of thousands of texts at a time. It’s a pie-in-the-sky idea, perhaps, but one that Mr. Moretti has put into practice. Since 2010, Stanford Literary Lab, which he founded with Matthew Jockers, has issued a string of pamphlets chronicling its research into topics ranging from loudness in the 19th-century novel to the evolving language of World Bank reports. Eleven of the pamphlets have now been collected in \"Canon/Archive,\" out next week from n+1 Books. The publication provides something of a retrospective occasion for Mr. Moretti, 67, who retired last spring from Stanford. But it also prompts a larger question at a time when the broader field of digital humanities is booming: What has the Big Data approach to literature added up to? It’s a question that draws heated answers. Digital humanities has been accused of fetishizing science, of acting as a Trojan horse for the corporate forces threatening the university, and worse. A recent broadside in The Chronicle of Higher Education called \"The Digital-Humanities Bust\" took a bludgeon to the field’s revolutionary rhetoric, with Mr. Moretti among those accused of issuing a stream of vague \"promissory notes\" for results that never arrive. Mr. Moretti — who prefers to call the lab’s work \"computational criticism\" — tends to greet such challenges with a mixture of modesty and bravado. \"Our results are not as good as what I had hoped for 10 or 15 years ago,\" he said in an interview earlier this month, during a brief trip to New York. \"We have not yet created a revolution in knowledge. But how much of literary scholarship is even trying to do that?\" [Read about some of the Stanford Literary Lab’s findings.] Mr. Moretti, who was born to teacher parents in a small town in northern Italy (his brother is the filmmaker Nanni Moretti), represents something of a paradox. He’s an intellectual trained in the grand European tradition who questions its most cherished methods. And he’s a professor who has achieved some measure of celebrity by promoting a ruthlessly impersonal idea of both scholarship and literary history itself. Literary criticism typically tends to emphasize the singularity of exceptional works that have stood the test of time. But the canon, Mr. Moretti argues, is a distorted sample. Instead, he says, scholars need to consider the tens of thousands of books that have been forgotten, a task that computer algorithms and enormous digitized databases have now made possible. \"We know how to read texts,\" he wrote in a much-quoted essay included in his book \"Distant Reading,\" which won the 2014 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism. \"Now let’s learn how to not read them.\" These days, Mr. Moretti has softened his rhetoric, though the underlying point is the same. \"Reading is one of life’s greatest pleasures,\" which we \"would be insane\" to give up, he said. \"But the question is whether reading and knowledge are continuous with each other.\" Mr. Moretti’s own output has a similar dividedness. His early work was grounded in close reading, and his last book \"The Bourgeois: Between History and Literature,\" included fine-grained analysis of classic works. That his digital provocations command wide interest even among highly skeptical colleagues may owe something to what Leah Price, professor of English at Harvard, called a \"Nixon in China\" effect. \"Only because his own close readings are so dazzling, does Moretti have the credibility to say: Read as closely as you want, but if you want to understand literary history you’ll need other tools,\" she said. The literary quality of the lab’s pamphlets, which are usually credited to teams of researchers, also doesn’t hurt. Yes, they bristle with bar charts, scatterplot diagrams and sometimes eyeball-blistering terminology. (\"‘Operationalizing’ must be the ugliest word I’ve ever used,\" Mr. Moretti writes in the first sentence of a solo-authored pamphlet called… \"Operationalizing.\") But they are also full of witty asides and suspenseful first-person narration that acknowledges surprises, dead-ends and the collaborative, experimental nature of the lab’s work. \"They’re very good at dramatizing the method,\" said Ted Underwood, a professor at the University of Illinois who also uses computational analysis. \"That’s part of the fun of reading them.\" Some of the lab’s results may seem less than earthshaking. For example, it turns out that what distinguishes the Gothic novel isn’t just castles and ghosts, but more frequent use of the certain verb tenses and prepositions. (The critic Kathryn Schulz, writing about some of the early pamphlets in The New York Times Book Review in 2011, said she \"mostly vacillated between two reactions: ‘Huh?’ and ‘Duh!’\") But even modest-seeming results — like the finding that from 1785 to 1900 the language of the British novel steadily shifted away from words relating to moral judgment to words associated with concrete description — unsettle established ideas of literary history. \"We tend to see literary history as a story of movements, periods, sudden revolutions,\" Mr. Underwood said. \"There are also these really broad, slow, massive changes that we haven’t described before.\" Some of the lab’s findings have themselves had sudden, and totally unexpected, real-world results. Mr. Moretti noted with amusement a flap last spring at the World Bank, where Paul Romer, the chief economist, was relieved of some management duties at its research arm after demanding, among other changes, that its publications reduce their use of the word \"and\" — one of the stylistic tics mocked in \"Bankspeak,\" a Lit Lab pamphlet analyzing the bank’s drift over 60 years toward more abstract and \"self-referential\" language. \"How many literary critics can say they got the chief economist of the World Bank, O.K., not fired, but deprived of some of his power?\" Mr. Moretti said with a laugh. Since retiring from Stanford, Mr. Moretti has moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he is helping to create a new digital humanities program at the country’s leading polytechnic. He also has a full slate of writing projects, including a study of forgotten 19th-century British best-sellers and an algorithm-free book based on his undergraduate lectures on American culture, to be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Even if the results of computational criticism never catch up with his early polemical fervor, Mr. Moretti remains unapologetic about trying. \"I’d rather be a failed revolutionary,\" he said, \"than someone who never tried to do a revolution in the first place.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/franco-moretti-stanford-literary-lab-big-data.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — Russian agents intending to sow discord among American citizens disseminated inflammatory posts that reached 126 million users on Facebook, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded over 1,000 videos to Google’s YouTube service, according to copies of prepared remarks from the companies that were obtained by The New York Times. The detailed disclosures, sent to Congress on Monday by companies whose products are among the most widely used on the internet, came before a series of congressional hearings this week into how third parties used social networks and online services to influence millions of Americans before the 2016 presidential election. The new information goes far beyond what the companies have revealed in the past and underline the breadth of the Kremlin’s efforts to lever open divisions in the United States using American technology platforms, especially Facebook. Multiple investigations of Russian meddling have loomed over the first 10 months of the Trump presidency, with one leading to the indictments of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chief, and others on Monday. In its prepared remarks sent to Congress, Facebook said the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin, had posted roughly 80,000 pieces of divisive content that was shown to about 29 million people between January 2015 and August 2017. Those posts were then liked, shared and followed by others, spreading the messages to tens of millions more people. Facebook also said it had found and deleted more than 170 accounts on its photo-sharing app Instagram; those accounts had posted about 120,000 pieces of Russia-linked content. Previously, Facebook had said it identified more than $100,000 in advertisements paid for by the Internet Research Agency. The Russia-linked posts were \"an insidious attempt to drive people apart,\" Colin Stretch, the general counsel for Facebook who will appear at the hearings, said in his prepared remarks. He called the posts \"deeply disturbing,\" and noted they focused on race, religion, gun rights, and gay and transgender issues. Facebook, Mr. Stretch said, was \"determined to prevent it from happening again.\" The new information also illuminated when Facebook knew there had been Russian interference on its platform. Several times before the election last Nov. 8, Facebook said its security team discovered threats targeted at employees of the major American political parties from a group called APT28, an agency that United States law enforcement officials have previously linked to Russian military intelligence operations. Facebook cautioned that the Russia-linked posts represented a minuscule amount of content compared with the billions of posts that flow through users’ News Feeds everyday. Between 2015 and 2017, people in the United States saw more than 11 trillion posts from Pages on Facebook. Twitter, in its prepared remarks, said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts on its service that were linked to the Internet Research Agency between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts, which Twitter has suspended, posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period. Outside of the activity of the Internet Research Agency, Twitter identified more than 36,000 automated accounts that posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that three-month period. The tweets received approximately 288 million views, according to the company’s remarks. Twitter noted that the 1.4 million Russia-linked election tweets represented less than three-quarters of one percent of all election-related tweets during that period. Google, in its prepared statement, said it had also found evidence that the Internet Research Agency bought ads on its services and created YouTube channels to upload short videos about divisive social issues including law enforcement, race relations or Syria. Google said it had found 18 channels that were \"likely associated\" with the Russian agents that posted political videos to YouTube. All told, those accounts — now suspended — uploaded more than 1,100 videos totaling 43 hours of content from 2015 through the summer of 2017. Google said, in general, those videos had very low view counts that added up to 309,000 views between the middle of 2015 and late 2016. Only three percent of the videos had more than 5,000 views and there was no evidence that the accounts had targeted American viewers, the company said. The internet search giant also confirmed earlier reports that the Internet Research Agency had purchased search and display ads from it. Google said the group had bought $4,700 in ads but none of them had targeted users by their political leanings, which was a targeting tool that Google added before the election. Google had been investigating a separate $53,000 in ad purchases with political material from Russian internet or building addresses, but discovered that those were not related to the Kremlin. \"While we found only limited activity on our services, we will continue to work to prevent all of it, because no amount of interference is acceptable,\" wrote Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, and Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel. The two men were scheduled to testify at separate congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday. For Facebook, Google and Twitter, the discovery of Russian influence by way of their sites has been a rude awakening. The companies had long positioned themselves as spreading information and connecting people for positive ends. Now the companies must grapple with how Russian agents used their technologies exactly as they were meant to be used — but for malevolent purposes. That has led to thorny debates inside the companies. For Facebook, the problem is less straightforward than finding Russia-linked pages and taking down content. Executives worry about how stifling speech from non-American entities could set a precedent on the social network — and how it could potentially be used against other groups in the future. So Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity — or the fact that the Russian agencies did not identify themselves as such — as a reason for taking down the accounts. \"Many of these ads did not violate our content policies,\" Elliot Schrage, vice president of policy and communications at Facebook, said in a company blog post earlier this month. \"That means that for most of them, if they had been run by authentic individuals, anywhere, they could have remained on the platform.\" Earlier this month, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner introduced a bipartisan bill to require internet companies to identify those who paid for political ads on the tech companies’ platforms. Facebook has been promoting its strengthened advertising disclosure policies as an attempt to pre-empt the bipartisan bill. Last week, Facebook began rolling out new features that provide insight into who is paying for ads, and it will maintain a publicly viewable database of ads purchased on the network. The company is also stepping up its counterintelligence and security measures. Facebook has said it is working with Twitter, Google and other companies to spot sophisticated threats earlier, and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement when appropriate. The company said it shuttered 5.8 million fake accounts in October 2016, and removed 30,000 accounts attempting to influence the French elections this year. Google also said it plans to increase its transparency for political ads. The company is working to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending. The company also said it planned to create a publicly accessible database into what election ads ran on Google’s AdWords — for example, web search ads — and YouTube. Google said it will identify the advertisers paying for political ads within a link accessible from the ad. But Google said it did not intend to take any further action against state-backed Russian news channel RT, which has built a massive online audience through YouTube. The American intelligence community has described RT as the Kremlin’s \"principal international propaganda outlet\", but Google said the organization had not violated any of its policies or misused the service. Last week, by contrast, Twitter said it would ban RT and Sputnik, another Kremlin-backed news organization, from advertising on its service.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Thanks to Wall St., There May Be Too Many Restaurants', 'text': ' PLAINFIELD, Ill. — The way Marcus Mooney saw it, he wasn’t just selling hot dogs — he was selling experiences. In addition to the classics — a cheese dog and a chili dog — his restaurant, Frank’s Night Out, served hot dogs topped with more exotic ingredients, like a \"Surf & Turf Dog\" featuring crumbles of garlic-basted Maine lobster. But the hot dog experiences Mr. Mooney offered were just one choice among hundreds for hungry motorists seeking a quick, inexpensive meal on this restaurant-laden stretch of Illinois Highway 59. His sales dropped. After opening his restaurant in 2013 and putting in seven-day work weeks, Mr. Mooney shuttered it last year. \"There becomes a point where there’s too many choices,\" Mr. Mooney said recently. \"The more restaurants that opened up, the more it took away from business for us.\" After a prolonged stretch of explosive growth, fueled by interest from Wall Street, experts say there are now too many fast-food, casual and other chain restaurants. Since the early 2000s, banks, private equity firms and other financial institutions have poured billions into the restaurant industry as they sought out more tangible enterprises than the dot-com start-ups that were going belly-up. There are now more than 620,000 eating and drinking places in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the number of restaurants is growing at about twice the rate of the population. That trend is evident on a more local level here in the sprawling suburbs southwest of Chicago, where the population is growing fast, but the number of restaurants is growing even faster. Twenty years ago, Mr. Mooney would have been competing against about 600 eateries in the region; by the end of last year, that number had more than doubled. \"Everybody thinks their brand has what it takes to succeed in the marketplace,\" said Victor Fernandez, an industry analyst with TDn2K, a Dallas-based firm that gathers data on the chain restaurant industry. \"You look at a location that looks good, but everybody is looking at the same place and they all come in, and the result is you get oversaturation.\" The glut of restaurants has increased the pressure on individual restaurant owners. Industry sales are up nationally, but growth has slowed to the lowest rate since 2010. Customers continue to spend a large share of their food budget in restaurants, but they’re spreading the money across a larger number of establishments, so profits are split into smaller individual pieces. Yet the industry — particularly chain restaurants — continues to expand, a strategy that both masks the problem and makes it likely that more places will falter. Sales at individual chain restaurants, compared with a year earlier, began dropping in early 2016, analysts reported. A majority of restaurants reported sales growth in just four of the last 22 monthly surveys from the National Restaurant Association. Before that, most restaurants had reported growth for 20 consecutive months, from March 2014 through October 2015, the survey found. As Americans work longer hours and confront an ever-growing array of food options, they are spending a growing share of their food budget — about 44 cents per dollar — on restaurants, according to food economists at the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service. But while consumer demand contributed to the restaurant boom, it was changes on Wall Street that really fueled the explosion. Chains like Del Taco, Papa Murphy’s and others began attracting money from private equity firms, and banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw lending opportunities in the restaurant industry. Those developments complemented each other well. New fast-food investors wanted to rely less on owning restaurants, and offloaded many company locations to eager buyers who came with bags of cheap money from the banks. The investors could then count on a steady stream of franchise fees and royalty payments — buffers against overall sales declines if, say, the market ever became oversaturated. And they didn’t have to worry about actually operating the restaurants. Franchisees pay for the right to operate a McDonald’s or a Subway, following rules that dictate everything from what type of taco to sell to where to buy iceberg lettuce. They take on the risks and costs of running the restaurants, in exchange for the marketing muscle and name recognition these big companies provide. While every Dunkin’ Donuts or Taco Bell may look the same, dozens and sometimes hundreds of independent owners can operate most of the restaurants within a single brand. But some franchisees say they’re being pressured to open too many stores as food companies push for new revenue streams. Buying an existing restaurant, for example, may mean agreeing to build 10 new ones. \"They want us to sign aggressive development agreements,\" said Shoukat Dhanani, the chief executive officer of the Dhanani Group, which owns hundreds of Burger King and Popeyes restaurants. \"I didn’t see that even five years ago.\" The shuttering of restaurants could have a major impact on the labor market. Since 2010, restaurants have accounted for one out of every seven new jobs, and many restaurateurs complain that it has become increasingly difficult to hire and retain workers. In Muscogee County, Ga., a former textile center, the Labor Department reported an overall decline in employment of 2,000 jobs since 2001 — but a gain of 2,700 restaurant jobs. Those positions could be in jeopardy if sales continue to fall and force more restaurants to close. Over the summer, the parent company of Applebee’s announced it would close more than 100 locations. In 2016 Subway, the nation’s largest fast-food chain by location count, closed more locations than it opened, the first time in its history that had happened. \"Year over year, we are seeing chain restaurants grow at twice the rate of overall population growth,\" said Mr. Fernandez, the TDn2K analyst. \"We believe now there are probably too many restaurants and too many brands.\" In this business environment, restaurant owners are often risking their personal fortunes when they open a Pizza Hut or create their own idea for a restaurant, like Frank’s Night Out. Melissa Arcache also plowed her life savings into her dream of running a successful restaurant. She now owns three branches of Bahama Buck’s, an island-themed frozen dessert chain decorated with surfboards and novelty mileage signs listing the distance to Bermuda and the Bimini Islands, in the Houston area. Even before Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, Ms. Arcache was struggling. Sales in August were down 10 percent from last year, and business fell further after the storm. She looks at all of the competitors opening up shop nearby and wonders what she can do. She said she doesn’t have a Plan B. \"This is what we’re going to make work,\" Ms. Arcache said during an interview at her store in Houston, which was recently vandalized, leaving behind dents in the walls she has yet to patch up. \"This is what’s going to feed my future kids and hopefully get them through college,\" she said. Mr. Mooney also put his life savings into his restaurant, Frank’s Night Out, only to see it fail. His personal life suffered, too — he was married when Frank’s opened but divorced by the time it closed. He now works as head chef for a company that owns a brewery and restaurant in the same strip mall where Frank’s Night Out was located, and passes by his old restaurant on his way to work. Transformed into a beef and gyro shop, the new establishment sells one of the items he created, a hot dog wrapped in bacon and topped with macaroni and cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. It even has the same name — the \"Deep South Dog.\" At first, Mr. Mooney said, he felt relief when he looked in and saw few customers. \"It allows you to think that the failure of it was not you,\" he said. But nine months later he’s rooting for the new restaurant to succeed. \"Now it’s kind of like, oh, man, I’m glad people are going in,\" he said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/business/too-many-restaurants-wall-street.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Anything Can Happen in Baseball, and Most of It Did in Game 5', 'text': ' HOUSTON — The flatbed cart hauling the equipment bags of the Los Angeles Dodgers zipped sharply through the field-level corridors of Minute Maid Park early Monday morning. The driver was in a hurry, and why not? The Dodgers had just blown three leads to the Houston Astros in one of the most frenzied games in World Series history. Home never looked so inviting. In his haste, though, the driver plowed right into an armchair jutting out near a lobby, in full view of Jim Crane, the Astros’ owner. This could be trouble. \"That’s all right,\" said Crane, who made his fortune in the freight business and understands the hazards. \"We can buy some new furniture.\" Crane was in a forgiving mood. He bought the Astros in 2011, when they were the worst team in the major leagues. Now they are one victory away from a championship, after surviving — there is no other word — a 13-12 odyssey in Game 5. The two sides bashed seven home runs and needed 5 hours 17 minutes to finish in 10 innings. \"Listen, you never expect a game like that,\" Crane said. \"That was just an incredible game. I had people texting me, ‘Jim, whoever wins, this is the best game I’ve ever seen!’ You want to be on top, of course. But it’s just incredible for the fans and the city.\" In the 657 World Series games that came before, only one had more total runs. Only one had more homers. Only one lasted longer. And none, perhaps, served onlookers with such a dizzying cocktail of enchantment and debauchery. The Astros and their fans have yearned for a moment like this. Founded in 1962, the franchise has never won the World Series and has made it only once before, in 2005, when it was host to a 5-hour-41-minute, 14-inning loss to the Chicago White Sox that was part of a four-game sweep. Twice in the 1980s, the Astros lost the final game of the National League Championship Series at home, in extra innings, as the visitors left town with a pennant. Now, it seems, the Astros have learned to play the modern game better than anyone else. In a major league season that included more home runs than ever before, the Astros led all teams in slugging percentage — while also having the fewest strikeouts. In that way, Game 5 was their masterpiece. The Astros got homers from Yuli Gurriel, Jose Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa and Brian McCann, and fanned just six times in 47 trips to the plate. The final batted ball was a two-out single to left by Alex Bregman off the Dodgers’ Kenley Jansen. Derek Fisher, a rookie pinch-runner, had been inserted just before that pitch for the first time in the series. He dashed home from second, slid his orange spikes across the plate, ahead of the throw, and popped up to embrace McCann, the veteran who had told him he would do something special. \"You never know when your time’s going to be, but you’re going to have a time,\" Fisher said McCann had promised him. \"And it’s going to be an important time.\" For the winning run to score on such a play — a first-pitch line drive, a two-base sprint and a smooth final slide — was oddly reassuring. Most of what came before was another home run derby, the second of the series. In Game 2 at Dodger Stadium last week, the teams combined for a record eight homers in a comeback victory for the Astros, by 7-6, in 11 innings. \"I didn’t think that would ever be topped,\" said Bregman, who debuted in the majors last year. \"I thought that would be the best game I ever played in my career. Who knows where this one ranks? Right up there with that game.\" The teams have combined for 22 homers in five games, breaking the World Series record of 21 set in seven games in 2002, the last year before baseball began testing for steroids. One theory for the new power surge is that hitters have learned to tailor their swings to launch more fly balls, reasoning that fly balls produce more runs than grounders. Many pitchers, though, suspect the balls are juiced because baseball wants more offense, as the Astros’ Dallas Keuchel asserted after the Game 2 slugfest. Before Sunday’s game, another Astros pitcher, Justin Verlander, told a roomful of reporters that the balls for this World Series were slicker, making them harder to grip and leading to erratic location. McCann — who hit last in the Astros’ lineup on Sunday despite 12 seasons as one of the best slugging catchers in baseball — gave a more nuanced explanation. \"Neither team was swinging out of the strike zone,\" he said. \"It’s really impressive. Both teams are having amazing at-bats. You play a team for seven games, you start seeing tendencies back and forth.\" Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers’ ace, had held the Astros to one run in seven innings of the Series opener, striking out 11 with no walks. This time, after facing the minimum number of batters through three innings, Kershaw lost command and the 4-0 lead his hitters had built against Keuchel. He could not complete the fifth. \"I don’t really pay attention to it,\" Kershaw said when asked about a possible change in the baseballs. \"I just assume that both sides are dealing with it, so I’m not going to worry about it.\" Jansen, who blew the save in Game 2, allowed a homer in Game 4 and lost Game 5, gave a similarly cagey response when asked about the ball. \"Something funny with it,\" he said. \"This is my eighth season in the big leagues. I have my thoughts; I’ll keep them to myself.\" Major league officials, naturally, insist that the balls conform to specifications, and that the only difference is the gold color of the printing stamped to them. Whatever the reason — the balls, the hitters, the heat in Los Angeles, the inviting left-field porch in Houston, something else — home runs are soaring. \"All these hitters are so good, it’s just amazing,\" Crane said. \"Any guy who gets up can hit it out of the ballpark, on either team, almost. I went into the commissioner’s box, we had a three-run lead and I was feeling pretty good. But I said, ‘It’s not over.’\" It was not over until Bregman delivered the game’s 25th run, a total matched in a 1997 World Series game but eclipsed only in Game 4 in 1993, when Toronto beat Philadelphia, 15-14. That game, at least, had a late oasis of shutdown pitching by Toronto relievers. Here, nearly all of the 14 pitchers seemed helpless. \"I’m sure everybody’s pretty exhausted after that,\" Kershaw said. \"Emotionally and physically.\" That was true, said Cody Bellinger, the Dodgers’ rookie first baseman, who homered and tripled in Game 5. But Bellinger, 22, could also frame it within a larger backdrop. \"That was pure entertainment,\" Bellinger said, adding later: \"Anything can happen. That’s why sports are so great, the unexpected. I don’t think anybody expected this.\" In a way, the spirit of that comment echoed the one Cincinnati’s Pete Rose made to Carlton Fisk at Fenway Park in Boston during Game 6 of the 1975 World Series. When he came to bat in the 11th inning, Rose told Fisk, the Red Sox’ catcher, \"Isn’t this the most exciting game you ever played in?\" The next inning, Fisk homered to win it for the Red Sox, who survived to play a Game 7 — won by the Reds on a single in the ninth inning. In that 1975 World Series, considered perhaps the finest ever played, the home team won Games 1, 3 and 5, while losing Games 2 and 4. That precise pattern has held up in only one other World Series in history: this one. In 1975, the Red Sox won Game 1 in Boston, but lost Game 2. When the series shifted to Cincinnati, the Reds won Game 3, lost Game 4 and won Game 5 — setting up the sublime sixth and seventh games. Likewise, in this World Series, the Dodgers took Game 1 in Los Angeles, but the Astros won Game 2. When the series shifted to Houston, the Astros won Game 3, lost Game 4 and won Game 5. With a championship in reach on Tuesday, the Astros will send Verlander to the mound at Dodger Stadium for Game 6. \"This is not going to be finished Tuesday,\" the Dodgers’ Yasiel Puig vowed. \"There’s going to be a Game 7.\" For a series this intoxicating, we should all be so lucky.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/sports/baseball/world-series-houston-astros-los-angeles-dodgers-game-5.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Loss of Federal Protections May Imperil Pacific Reefs, Scientists Warn', 'text': ' HONOLULU — Terry Kerby has been piloting deep-sea submarines for four decades, but nothing prepared him for the devastation he observed recently on several underwater mountains called seamounts in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. \"It was a biological desert,\" he said. Where normally fish and crabs dart about forests of coral and sponges, \"all we could can see was a parking lot full of nets and lines, with no life at all.\" Mr. Kerby and Brendan Roark, a geographer at Texas A&M University, are comparing seamounts that have been fished to those in pristine, protected areas. This month, they surveyed the upper reaches of four seamounts, one of which, Hancock, lies inside Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which includes the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. They knew that the seamounts had been fished by trawlers and coral harvesters at some point. \"But the extent of the devastation and the huge amount of gear that was abandoned on the bottom were shocking for both of us,\" he said. Among the casualties littering the seabed were ten-foot-tall black corals that can live over 4,000 years, among the oldest forms of life on earth. \"Allowing fishing in the few protected seamounts left would be a huge mistake,\" said Dr. Roark. It’s a sentiment widely shared among marine ecologists. The Trump administration is considering rolling back federal protections for 10 national monuments, including two in the central Pacific. The Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument and the Rose Atoll National Marine Monument protect the waters around a handful of islands, most uninhabited, to the south of the Hawaii Islands. The shore reefs of the islands have long been protected from commercial fishing; the monument designations extended that protection to 50 miles from shore in some cases and 200 miles in others. According to a memo obtained by the Washington Post in September, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has recommended that the designations of the Pacific Remote Islands and the Rose Atoll be amended \"to allow commercial fishing.\" (A similar recommendation was made for another marine monument, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, off the coast of New England.) The memo did not mention the largest marine reserve: Papahānaumokuākea, a string of mostly uninhabited atolls and reefs that have been largely undisturbed since World War II. At about 583,000 square miles, it is the largest protected area on the planet. (Industry officials in Hawaii are pressing for commercial fishing to be allowed there, too.) Many scientists see these marine reserves as among the last rich, untouched ecosystems where they can study the effects of climate change in isolation from the impacts of overfishing or pollution. The fishing industry here in Hawaii sees it differently. A driving force behind the administration’s reconsideration is an obscure but powerful quasi-governmental organization called the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, or Wespac, based in Honolulu. The council has jurisdiction over the waters where 140 long-line vessels based in Hawaii — as well as a handful in American Samoa — fish mostly for tuna and billfish. Wespac has argued that limits on catch, gear and fishing seasons are the best tools to regulate fishing and to ensure that the Pacific yields the maximum sustainable harvests. Over the years, the council has strongly opposed the creation and expansions of each of the marine monuments. This year, the council has embraced a new slogan: \"Make America Great Again: Return U.S. fishermen to U.S. waters.\" In a presentation to members of the other fisheries councils in February, Wespac officials claimed the marine monuments \"curtailed economic growth\" and \"compromised national food security.\" Ray Hilborn, a fisheries expert at the University of Washington and a scientific adviser to Wespac, argues that tuna and billfish are highly migratory and travel in and out of the reserves. \"The monuments just force the fishermen to go farther and spend more fuel to catch the same fish,\" he said in an interview. \"It’s a fake protection.\" Asked whether Wespac sought to reintroduce fishing only in monument waters or also in near-shore reefs, Kitty Simonds, the longtime executive director, said in an email that the council also would review \"the management measures that were in place before the monument designation and may recommend changes.\" The fishing industry in Hawaii is hardly in trouble, several experts noted. Indeed, the Hawaii fleet’s bigeye tuna catch has doubled since 2006, even though half of America’s Pacific waters are now off-limits to fishing. Robert Richmond, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii, pointed out that the Hawaii fleet filled its yearly quota of bigeye in August this year, \"so they obviously don’t need more space to fish. They’re just against all protected areas on principle.\" Over 500 million people depend on reefs for protein, Dr. Richmond said, and they already yield far less than they could if they were sustainably fished. Reef ecosystems may become even less productive as the ocean gets warmer and more acidic. Dr. Richmond and other scientists also took issue with Dr. Hilborn’s criticism of marine monuments. They say the reserves serve as havens for species depleted elsewhere and for populations migrating away from the Equator, where warming waters are lowering plankton density. \"The fisheries benefits of marine reserves are now beyond doubt,\" Callum Roberts, a marine conservation biologist at the University of York, said in an email. \"They allow fish populations to grow back and spill fish into surrounding waters, they pour fountains of offspring into ocean currents that seed fisheries, and they provide resilience to environmental shocks.\" The tools favored by fisheries officials target a few species to the neglect of others, he added, while \"reserve benefits reach entire ecosystems.\" One of the islands on Mr. Zinke’s list is Palmyra, an atoll that lies 1,000 miles south of Hawaii and is part of the Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument. The Nature Conservancy has been running a marine lab there since 2005, the only site with housing and a runway for small aircraft located in one of the most untouched tropical marine ecosystems in the world. With 170 inches of rain a year — compared with 37 in Seattle — Palmyra also has a dense rain forest where 11 species of seabirds nest. Discoveries made there include a surprising link between fish and seabirds: a study found that nesting birds’ droppings carried onto the reef by the rain stimulated plankton growth that attracted manta rays and other plankton feeders. Other research has shown that the classic picture of a coral reef, with lots of pretty little fish and a few big ones, is entirely artificial. Palmyra’s reefs, like those in the other monuments, are dominated by sharks, snappers, jacks and other top predators, while smaller prey cower in fear in holes in the coral, a study found. So interconnected are the elements of intact reef communities that allowing fishing just beyond 12 miles would disrupt the ecosystem, said Alan Friedlander, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii and chief scientist of the National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas project. \"You need to keep the fishing as far away as possible, ideally at 200 miles,\" said Dr. Friedlander. Moreover, the remote locations are difficult to police. Many of the denizens of intact tropical reefs, like humphead parrotfish and wrasses, are worth thousands of dollars in Asia, said Dr. Richmond. \"Fishing them sustainably, as Wespac proposes, would mean traveling very long distances from Hawaii and taking very few fish,\" he said. \"It wouldn’t be economical.\" Dr. Richmond predicted that fishing vessels \"would poach the heck out of those islands.\" Daniel Pauly, a prominent fisheries scientist at the University of British Columbia, says that given a chance, the value of the bigger reserves like those around Wake and Johnston atolls and Jarvis Island, which extend to 200 miles offshore, will increase over time. Why? Evolution. Research by Jonathan A. Mee, a fish geneticist at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, suggests that in any large marine reserve, some \"lazy\" fish will spend their whole lives inside the boundaries and therefore will not be caught — and the bigger the reserve, the more fish inside it will live longer. This will raise the number of what scientists call B.O.F.F.s (Big Old Fecund Females), which produce more eggs and eggs of better quality, further increasing the density of fish inside the reserve. Dr. Mee believes that evolutionary selection of a putative \"lazy\" gene would accelerate the population growth inside a reserve. \"The bigger the mortality outside the reserve, the faster the population inside will grow,\" Dr. Mee said in an interview. This would be particularly helpful for bigeye tuna, which is the mainstay of the sushi market and the principal target of the Hawaii long-line fleet. The population of bigeye in the central and western Pacific is now estimated to be 16 percent of its original size. \"Technology and subsidies have allowed industrial fleets to go farther and farther, and deeper and deeper, and to deplete stock after stock,\" said Dr. Pauly, who has shown that the global catch is steadily falling. \"The only thing standing between these fleets and global depletion are these big no-take reserves, so this is the time to create more, not to open up the existing ones to fishing.\" Alex David Rogers, a conservation biologist and seamount expert at Oxford University, estimated that worldwide there were about 16,000 seamounts with summits above 5,000 feet, shallow enough to harbor a rich diversity of fish and corals. Unfortunately, he said, most have already been fished. Still those seamounts in the Papahānaumokuākea and Pacific Remote Islands marine monuments remain mostly pristine, said Chris Yesson, an expert on ocean floors at the Zoological Society of London. \"Saving the ones in the American marine monuments is extremely important, because the NW Pacific is particularly rich in endemic corals and other marine life,\" Dr. Rogers wrote in an email. Paul Achitoff, managing attorney for Earthjustice’s mid-Pacific office in Honolulu, said many legal scholars had concluded that the Antiquities Act, which allows presidents to designate and protect monuments without congressional approval, is a one-way street. \"It does not allow presidents to remove restrictions or protections from a previously designated monument,\" he said in an interview. \"Only Congress can do that.\" He acknowledged that several presidents had changed monument boundaries and tweaked restrictions without court challenges. That may change soon. \"If any of the protections to the Pacific marine monuments are lifted, we will be filing lawsuits, and we expect to win,\" Mr. Achitoff said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/science/trump-zinke-pacific-marine-reserves.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'world': [{'title': 'Catalonia Leader Turns Up in Belgium After Spain Seeks Prosecution', 'text': ' BARCELONA, Spain — Hours after the Spanish authorities announced that they would seek to prosecute Catalonia’s separatists for rebellion, Carles Puigdemont, the region’s dismissed leader, turned up on Monday in Belgium, where he may seek asylum. Mr. Puigdemont’s reputation for unpredictability has grown with every turn of Catalonia’s secessionist drama. On Monday, he all but disappeared as the Madrid central government began using emergency laws to take over direct administration of Catalonia after its declaration of independence last week. Speculation had mounted as to what he was up to over the course of the day, until a lawyer in Belgium finally ended the mystery surrounding Mr. Puigdemont’s whereabouts late Monday. \"I have been consulted by Puigdemont and he asked me to protect his interests in the future in Belgium,\" said Paul Bekaert, a Flemish lawyer. Mr. Bekaert said that the two men had met in Belgium and that the conversation was \"about what possibly could come, whatever the Spanish government has ready for him.\" Mr. Bekaert emphasized his \"more than 30 years of experience with extradition and political asylum\" cases, including with Basques who were fighting extradition to Spain to face trial on terrorism charges. Belgium is virtually the only national government in Europe that has been even remotely sympathetic to Mr. Puigdemont’s pleas for mediation, not least perhaps because the country has faced separatist tensions of its own led by Flemish hard-liners. Awkwardly, Brussels is also the headquarters of a European Union bureaucracy that has held the Catalan secessionists at arms’ length, for fear of upsetting Spain, one of the bloc’s largest member states, and stoking forces of fragmentation in other parts of the Continent. On Monday, while there was no official confirmation that Mr. Puigdemont had gone to Brussels, the Belgian and Spanish news media variously suggested that he had arrived for consultations, to seek political asylum, or to even declare a Catalan \"government in exile.\" The speculation kicked into high gear not long after Spain’s attorney general, José Manuel Maza, called around noon in Madrid for the prosecution of Mr. Puigdemont and 19 other Catalan politicians, stopping short of ordering their immediate arrest. Mr. Maza said he wanted the Catalan politicians to appear \"urgently\" in court in Madrid. A decision would be left to Spanish judges whether to charge or jail them. The politicians could face 30 years in prison for the most serious of the potential charges, which included rebellion and sedition. Officially, the Belgian government said it had no knowledge of Mr. Puigdemont’s presence in the country. But the statements of some officials seemed to hint at an openness to accepting Mr. Puigdemont and other Catalan officials if they chose exile. \"It is not unrealistic, if you see the situation at this moment, and the repression from Madrid and the prison sentences with which they are threatening, that the question is whether such a person still has a chance to a fair trial of course,\" Belgium’s migration minister, Theo Francken, told VTM News, a Belgian television station, over the weekend. \"That’s where we enter into a difficult diplomatic situation with the Spanish government,\" he added. Mr. Francken is a member of the New Flemish Alliance party, which favors Flemish independence from the rest of Belgium and has historically had strong links to the Catalan separatists as a kindred movement. This month, members of the alliance hung the Catalan independence flag — the Estelada — in the Belgian Parliament, in a gesture of support. But Belgium’s prime minister, Charles Michel, has dismissed the possibility of granting asylum to Mr. Puigdemont, saying it \"is absolutely not on the agenda\" and called on Mr. Francken \"not to fan the flames.\" Mr. Puigdemont’s arrival presents a direct challenge to Mr. Michel, a Federalist, who as the leader of a delicate government coalition will have to keep separatists in his own government in check while trying to maintain good diplomatic relations with Spain. The Spanish news media had reported that Mr. Puigdemont had left Catalonia with five other deposed members of his cabinet, traveled by car to the southern French city of Marseille, and then by plane to Brussels. In Spain, officials from Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s conservative Popular Party said their priority on Monday was to make sure Mr. Puigdemont did not try to stay in office, by insisting he remained leader of Catalonia, rather than worry about him escaping the country. Fernando Martínez-Maíllo, a senior Popular Party official, characterized Mr. Puigdemont’s departure as \"a desperate act.\" Albert Rivera, the leader of the Ciudadanos party, which is strongly opposed to secession, accused Mr. Puigdemont and his separatist leadership of \"fleeing the country\" while leaving his Catalan civil servants to resist and continue to break Spanish law. Indeed, the forcible steps by the central government have now left Catalan civil servants and politicians with the painful choice of sticking to their secessionist plans and defying Madrid’s direct administration or facing the potential of criminal charges. Not least, there was the important decision for separatist parties about whether to take part in regional elections called by Madrid or to risk sidelining themselves. The two main Catalan parties — including Mr. Puigdemont’s Catalan European Democratic Party — said on Monday they would run in the elections, which are scheduled for Dec. 21, although perhaps no longer as part of the coalition that won the most parliamentary seats in 2015. Germà Bel, a separatist Catalan lawmaker, said Mr. Puigdemont’s possible hopes of running a government from exile was \"symbolic.\" \"I don’t know of anyone who’s run a government from overseas,\" he said. \"Even Charles de Gaulle didn’t run a government from overseas.\" But he argued that it would be hard for Mr. Rajoy’s government to maintain control over Catalonia for an extended period. The decision by pro-independence parties to take part in the December elections meant that they \"at least implicitly\" accept they are still part of Spain — no small concession. \"This election has been called by the Spanish government under Spanish law — and it will be an election run within the state,\" Mr. Bel said. With the emergency measures taken over the weekend, Mr. Rajoy opted not to appoint a caretaker leader of Catalonia. Instead, the country’s deputy prime minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, took over the management of the Catalan administration from Madrid, and dispatched a senior central government official to Barcelona on Monday. Juan Ignacio Zoido, the Spanish interior minister, said on Monday that the takeover of the Catalan police force, known as the Mossos, had gone smoothly. He fired the Mossos police chief, Josep Lluís Trapero, over the weekend and appointed the deputy leader of the force, Ferran López, to the post. Under the emergency measures allowed by Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, the provision invoked by Mr. Rajoy to take control of Catalonia, the national government could replace the 17,000 officers of the Mossos with Spanish police officers. But Mr. Zoido said that \"at no point did we consider eliminating the Mossos police corps.\" Mr. Zoido called on separatist leaders to remove their personal belongings from their offices on Monday and to leave, focusing solely on preparing for the December elections, as candidates. At least one member of Mr. Puigdemont’s ousted cabinet, Josep Rull, defiantly went to work Monday morning, after the region’s president sent a message over the weekend urging Catalans to peacefully oppose Madrid’s takeover and the removal of a democratically elected regional government. After spending one hour in his office, Mr. Rull, the Catalan minister for planning and sustainability, left in a waiting car, but without his police detail, telling reporters that he had not removed his belongings from his office. \"Today I came to my office to carry out the work that the Catalan people entrusted to us,\" he said. \"And now I will continue, normally, with my agenda.\" The possibility that separatist leaders might be charged with rebellion has prompted a major dispute among Spanish lawyers. Diego López Garrido, who drafted changes to the Spanish legal code relating to rebellion, told Antena 3 that \"in my judgment, there is no crime of rebellion because no violence has been produced.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/Carlos-puigdemont-Belgium-Spain.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Sexual Harassment Claims Surface in U.K. Parliament', 'text': ' LONDON — To the British lawmaker it was just \"good-humored high jinks.\" But after admitting that he had asked a female member of his staff to buy sex toys, Mark Garnier was at the center of a formal investigation on Monday amid a litany of accusations of sexual harassment, inappropriate behavior and casual sexism in Parliament. Mr. Garnier, a member of the Conservative Party and the minister for international trade, was hanging on to his job. Contacted by the Mail on Sunday, Mr. Garnier admitted to the actions and to using sexual innuendo, while insisting that they did \"not constitute harassment.\" Perhaps as worrying for Prime Minister Theresa May were separate allegations that 36 of her lawmakers, including two serving cabinet ministers, have exhibited inappropriate behavior, like being \"handsy with women at parties\" or having \"sexual relations with a researcher.\" The claims surfaced in several media outlets, including a website called Guido Fawkes, which published a list of 36 accusations against members of Parliament who have been accused of sexual harassment with the names redacted. The claims have come to light amid accusations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment, and while none are as serious as those made against the movie mogul, they nevertheless paint an unseemly picture of life in the Houses of Parliament. Politics, like the world of entertainment, is a highly competitive profession in which senior, mainly male, individuals have the power to make or break careers. Recent days have produced a blizzard of accusations against lawmakers of varying degrees of seriousness, with all suggesting a degree of sexism or complacency about inappropriate behavior. Last week the opposition Labour Party suspended one of its lawmakers, Jared O’Mara, while it investigates allegations that he made a series of misogynistic and homophobic comments. The former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb has apologized for \"sexual chatter\" with a 19-year-old who applied for a job in his office. And on Saturday Michael Gove, the environment secretary, prompted angry complaints after joking that being interviewed by the BBC presenter John Humphrys was like entering Mr. Weinstein’s bedroom and hoping \"you emerge with your dignity intact.\" Mr. Gove apologized unreservedly. In addition to announcing an inquiry by the Cabinet Office into Mr. Garnier’s actions, Mrs. May has written to the speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, to seek better ways for lawmakers’ staff members to raise concerns about their employers. Mr. Bercow told lawmakers on Monday, however, that political parties did not require his intervention to adopt an effective grievance scheme. That effectively put the onus on party leaders to police their own rank and file. \"Make no mistake,\" he added, \"there is a need for change.\" Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, conceded that current safeguards, including a confidential help line, were inadequate. \"We do indeed need to change things,\" said Anna Soubry, a Conservative Party lawmaker. \"Things can’t go on as they are.\" Harriet Harman, a veteran Labour lawmaker and campaigner, agreed, saying, \"This is not hysteria, this is long overdue.\" To some, the recent spate of allegations has revived memories of the 1990s. Then, as now, a weak Conservative government that was divided over Europe became embroiled in a series of scandals that were all the more embarrassing because the prime minister, John Major, had promised that his party would get \"back to basics.\" In an earlier era, women were openly taunted. Diane Abbott, a senior Labour lawmaker, said that when she first joined Parliament in 1987, male colleagues would gesture as if they were weighing their breasts when women spoke in the chamber. Back then, Parliament generally sat late into the night and alcohol consumption was higher, leading to more unacceptable behavior. In recent years, the parliamentary authorities have made the legislature a more sober and family-friendly place, many lawmakers say. But suspicions linger that Westminster tolerates behavior that would be unacceptable in other workplaces. According to one longstanding rumor, the party whips, who are responsible for discipline in Parliament, keep a \"black book\" detailing bad behavior by lawmakers. But instead of being exposed, this information is used to pressure them to vote as instructed, so the story goes. On Tuesday, reports that Mrs. May had been briefed on such allegations on a regular basis were denied by Downing Street. Ms. Abbott argued that, despite progress, there is still a long way to go before sexist or inappropriate behavior disappears from Parliament, where it sometimes affects even those who are not parliamentary staff. Last year Isabel Hardman, a senior political journalist at The Spectator magazine, described how a male lawmaker had approached her with the words \"I want to talk to the totty,\" using British slang for an attractive woman.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/sexual-harassment-british-parliament.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Critics Scoff as Kremlin Erects Monument to the Repressed', 'text': ' MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday called the unveiling of the first Kremlin-promoted monument to the victims of political repression an important step toward preventing oppression in Russia, but critics accused the government of hypocrisy given the continued lack of political rights. \"We and our successors should remember the tragedy of repressions and the reasons that caused them,\" Mr. Putin said during the rainy evening ceremony. The memory serves \"as a powerful admonition against their repetition.\" The Russian president, who ordered the construction of the monument, the \"Wall of Sorrow,\" three years ago, described political repression as a crime, but stressed that future generations should remember the victims without bringing the country to renewed confrontation by \"settling scores.\" About 40 critics, many of them veterans of the struggle for human rights in the Soviet Union, accused the Kremlin in a petition they released on Facebook of trying to whitewash the present. \"The current Russian government, in sponsoring the opening of the monument, is trying to pretend that political repression is a thing long since past,\" the petition read. \"We state with certainty that Russia’s current political prisoners are worthy of our help and attention no less than the victims of the Soviet regime are worthy of our memory and respect.\" Among those who signed were famous Soviet-era dissidents, including Aleksandr Podrabinek, Pavel Litvinov and Vladimir Bukovsky, as well as Mustafa Dzhemilev, a longstanding Tatar leader in Crimea who was exiled after opposing Russia’s 2014 annexation. Others, however, called the new monument an important step. Elena B. Zhemkova, chief operating officer of Memorial, a beleaguered organization founded to establish a record of the repressed, called a state-backed national monument significant. \"When this monument is unveiled by the top figure in the state, being created on behalf of the state,\" she said at a news conference before the unveiling, \"it will mean our state says: ‘Terror is a crime. Mass terror, unfair murders of individuals are a crime, and it is bad.’\" Roman Romanov, the director of the Gulag Museum, which helped raise money for the memorial, said there had been frequent struggles over remembering. The museum itself has been picketed by opponents who label the entire Gulag experience \"fiction.\" \"The fact that it is taking place by presidential decree and it is supported by ordinary citizens, who gave money for the monument, indicates to me that this is a new point of reckoning,\" Mr. Romanov said. The monument was built on an old parking lot on a prominent crossroads in the center of Moscow, but it is distant from pedestrian traffic. It sits at the end of a street named after Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet nuclear physicist, Nobel laureate and human rights campaigner. The placement of the dark, shadowy bronze sculpture at an ordinary intersection was meant to emphasize that repression could happen anyplace, said Georgy Frangulyan, the artist who spent two years creating it. The central part consists of a curved wall, almost 100 feet long and 20 feet high, made up of what appear to be human figures. The overall shape, Mr. Frangulyan said, represents the grim reaper’s scythe, given that victims were mowed down indiscriminately, while the lack of recognizable faces or figures underscores the victims’ anonymity. The artist said working on the piece continued to haunt him. \"It is very hard to escape this state of mind,\" he said. \"Do not look for beauty here: It is a state of tragedy.\" The city of Moscow donated much of the approximately $6 million cost, while corporate donors and individuals gave roughly $800,000 more. It is not the first such monument, but it is the first built by presidential decree. A chunk of rock from the Solovki labor camp, the first in what became the national gulag system, sits in front of the Lubyanka Square headquarters of the secret police. In September, at Butovo, an estate near Moscow, a wall bearing the names of about 20,000 victims shot there was opened as part of a memorial garden. Confronting the harrowing legacy of government repression, especially the labor camps, has long been a contentious issue. Those who want a full vetting of the crimes of the past argue that the future will be hobbled without a thorough reckoning. Opponents call the subject too divisive and say it is best forgotten. They include, in particular, members of the Communist Party and a growing number of people who consider the bloody purges under Stalin a necessary if harsh means needed to modernize the country. An estimated 750,000 people were executed during the height of the Great Terror, in 1937 and 1938, but the victims number in the millions when the labor camps, forced collectivization, famine and other horrors are taken into account. Given that the machinery of state repression was run by the ancestor agencies of the Russian security service, the F.S.B., which still controls Russia, historians and others hold out little hope for a thorough examination. The struggle is constant. The administration of the Gulag Museum said it was currently wrestling for control of a building near Lubyanka whose new owner has plans to turn it into a high-end perfume store. In Stalin’s time it was called \"The Shooting House\" because more than 31,000 people were sentenced to death there at the height of the terror campaign, according to Mr. Romanov, the museum director. Others point to the persecution of Yuri Dimitriev, a historian who, working for the local chapter of Memorial in the northern region of Karelia, discovered extensive mass graves. He faces child pornography charges over images found on his computer, a not uncommon accusation made in recent years against those the government wants to silence. Some people doubt just how far down memory lane the government wants to go. Sergei Lebedev, a writer whose novel \"Oblivion\" treats the turmoil of a descendant grappling with the legacy of the camps — both the oppressed and the oppressors — said he was concerned the Russian government would consider its work done with the monument. It has never opened the archives from the period, and actively fought against Memorial as the group tried to catalog the victims. And it has never acknowledged that some who ran the machinery of repression should bear criminal responsibility. \"The first thing you want from them is to make complete lists, to try to understand the full scale, to name all the names,\" Mr. Lebedev said. \"This was never done by the state.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/russia-soviet-repression-monument.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Jews of the Diaspora Bring Their Cause to the Israeli Public', 'text': ' JERUSALEM — In June, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel abruptly suspended a hard-won accord to give non-Orthodox Jewish men and women a more dignified place to worship together at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, and then moved to bolster Orthodox control over conversions to Judaism in Israel, the backlash was swift and fierce. Protesters rallied outside Mr. Netanyahu’s home. Powerful American allies angrily demanded meetings. Philanthropists in the diaspora threatened to cut off their aid to Israel. Insults flew. Mr. Netanyahu accused the Reform movement, which has many adherents in the United States but relatively few in Israel, of using the Western Wall agreement to gain recognition in the country \"via the back door, secretly.\" Reform and Conservative Jewish leaders accused the prime minister of lying and trying to incite the ultra-Orthodox against them. The Sephardic chief rabbi of Jerusalem likened Reform Jews to Holocaust deniers. With old arguments over who is a Jew playing out nastily again in public, it seemed that major portions of American and Israeli Jewry were heading for a damaging breach. In the Old City on Monday, visiting leaders of the Reform and Conservative movements who had pressed for the changes at the Western Wall could do little more than fume, as a minister in Mr. Netanyahu’s government described for them a weak consolation prize: minor improvements to the tucked-away space where mixed-gender prayer has long been confined, largely unseen and all but undiscoverable to those who are not specifically looking for it. \"A few little crumbs,\" Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, bitterly called it. Yet rather than ratcheting up the name-calling war with Mr. Netanyahu’s government, Rabbi Jacobs and other leaders of the Jewish Agency of Israel — a group that supports Jewish diversity and inclusion and that helped negotiate the Western Wall agreement — now say they are starting an ambitious campaign to influence public opinion about the needs of diaspora and less-religious Jews where they are understood least, and where their political clout is feeblest: in Israel itself. On Tuesday, 120 of the group’s international board of governors plan to descend on Parliament, meeting with dozens of Israeli legislators, including some members of the ultra-Orthodox parties, in what Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident who leads the Jewish Agency, called \"our biggest lobbying effort ever.\" \"The problem is not just that the prime minister gave in to political pressure,\" he said in an interview. \"The ministers feel that they don’t have to pay a political price, and that’s because there’s not that much awareness\" of the needs of non-Orthodox Jews. \"So we’re doing a lot of other work to make Israeli society know this problem better.\" The lobbying day is to be followed by an advertising and media campaign, educational efforts in Israeli schools and trips for Israeli lawmakers and leaders to the United States \"to give them a real-life glimpse of what and who we are,\" said Rabbi Jacobs of the Reform movement. \"The assumptions and mistaken understandings of what world Jewry are about are legion.\" The fight over equitable access to the Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, is in a sense a fight over real estate. Popular images of Jewish men worshiping at the wall in prayer shawls and phylacteries show only a small stretch of the ancient retaining wall for the Temple Mount. A large section of that plaza is reserved for men, a smaller one for women. Some distance to the south is Robinson’s Arch, an area of the wall designated in 2003 to host egalitarian prayer services. Yet the limitations of that setting — on a temporary platform, down a lengthy staircase from the main plaza, surrounded by fences and other obstructions, and accessible through an isolated gate — have upset Reform and Conservative Jewish leaders. Their complaints appeared to be satisfied in January 2016, when after years of negotiations Mr. Netanyahu’s government approved a compromise that would create an improved egalitarian prayer space, along with a joint entrance to all the Western Wall prayer areas. Reform and Conservative Jews were to be given a stake in a committee overseeing the complex’s management. All told, the agreement would give non-Orthodox worshipers, at least to a degree, the feeling of equal status. Nearly a year and a half went by without its being adopted, however. And in June, just as the Jewish Agency was meeting in Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu bowed to fierce pressure from his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners and announced he was suspending the agreement. In a meeting at Robinson’s Arch on Monday, Tzachi Hanegbi, a minister without portfolio in Mr. Netanyahu’s government, assured leaders of the Jewish Agency that plans were continuing to improve the prayer space, and he said that management of it would be entrusted to the Israel Antiquities Authority, which he said could be trusted to treat all branches of Judaism fairly. \"It’s true that the entrance is not going to be equal,\" Mr. Hanegbi added, acknowledging a key grievance arising from Mr. Netanyahu’s reversal, and then minimizing it: \"But I don’t think that the Jewish people for 3,500 years prayed for an entrance.\" Mr. Hanegbi was frank about the political challenges facing Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition, which he said had been in danger of collapse in June over the Western Wall deal. When he suggested more negotiations, one of the visiting officials asked him what guarantee there was that even a renegotiated deal would ever be carried out. \"Nothing,\" he replied. \"That’s the truth.\" Mr. Hanegbi gamely hung around long enough for Jewish Agency representatives to try their hand at the new mission of educating Israelis about the concerns of diaspora Jews. Shoshana Dweck, an executive with the Association of Reform Zionists of America, urged him to consider how demeaning it felt to be relegated to second-class citizenship. \"It was never about a seat at a lunch counter, or a seat on the bus,\" she said in a scolding near-whisper. Mr. Sharansky’s organization and its diverse membership see other threats on the near horizon, not least the bill to tighten ultra-Orthodox control over conversions to Judaism in Israel. Mr. Netanyahu delayed a vote on the conversion bill for six months, but that means it could come up for final passage in December. All of which leaves people like Rabbi Jacobs in something of a hurry. \"We’re geared up and ready to fight a long and important battle,\" he said late on Monday. \"It’s a battle that’s for the soul of Israel.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/middleeast/reform-conservative-jewish-leaders-pr-blitz.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Who Betrayed Anne Frank?

Agent Reopens a Cold Case', 'text': ' AMSTERDAM — Hiding from the Gestapo in a secret annex of her father’s warehouse in Amsterdam during World War II, Anne Frank heard a little knock on the wall. She could not be sure who or what it was, and it frightened her. She was right to be scared: Just months later, on Aug. 4, 1944, the police discovered the hide-out during a raid and arrested her and seven others living behind a movable bookcase. All but Otto Frank, the diarist’s father, and later the editor of \"The Diary of a Young Girl,\" perished in Nazi death camps. Who gave them up has remained a mystery. Now, almost 75 years later, a team of experts led by a retired F.B.I. agent is bringing modern forensic science and criminology to bear in hopes of solving one of history’s most famous cold case files. \"We will put special emphasis on new leads,\" said the retired special agent, Vince Pankoke, 59, who is leading the effort. \"We need to verify stories as they come in, and we know that is going to lead to further investigation.\" In the search for new leads, he and his team are digitally combing through millions of pages of scanned material from the National Archives in Washington as well as archives in the Netherlands, Germany and Israel. The use of other modern techniques like forensic accounting, crowd sourcing, behavioral science and testimonial reconstruction may also hold promise of a breakthrough. The team, for example, is carrying out a three-dimensional scan of the original house and using computer models to determine how far sounds might have traveled. Those techniques may allow them to re-evaluate old evidence — for instance, whether the knock on the wall, described in Anne Frank’s diary, was someone telling those hiding that they were being too loud, or whether it could have been a trap. Such modern and expensive techniques were not available to the Dutch national police when they unsuccessfully investigated the case in 1948 and again in 1963. Much is known about Anne Frank’s life during her two years in hiding, thanks both to her famous diary and the accounts of helpers and friends published after the war. But far less is known about the circumstances surrounding the raid on Aug. 4, 1944. The raid ended her time in the house on the Prinsengracht and precipitated her long and torturous journey to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she is believed to have died in February 1945. In a country from which an estimated 108,000 Jews were deported — of whom only about 5,500 returned — the reopening of the case is also part of a larger national conversation. \"She used to be the girl that we protected and now she has become the girl that we betrayed,\" said Bart van der Boom, an expert on the Nazi occupation and a lecturer at Leiden University. \"It’s a function of how the Dutch perceive themselves during the occupation.\" That perception changed in the 1960s, said Dr. van der Boom, when the Dutch started to question the traditional narrative that all Dutch people were victims of the Nazis. The Dutch Resistance Museum in Amsterdam, for example, now features a narrative thread describing the life of a collaborator, as well as ones about people who stayed neutral, those who resisted and those who were victimized. At least 28,000 Jews hid from the Germans during the four-year occupation of the Netherlands, Dr. van de Boom said. Of those, roughly a third were caught, the vast majority because of the efforts of a small band of paid collaborators known in Dutch as \"Jodenjagers,\" or Jew hunters, he said. \"We don’t know what happened exactly on that fateful day, and there is something intriguing about an open end in a narrative,\" said Ronald Leopold, the executive director of the Anne Frank House foundation, which runs the museum and conducts research into her life and death. \"Betrayers did not have the classical image we have of perpetrator, those uniformed faces of death,\" Mr. Leopold said. The figure of the betrayer is important in the life of Anne Frank because, unlike the police and soldiers who would be responsible for her death, the betrayer was possibly known by the Frank family, and almost certainly was not someone wearing an official uniform. The list of possible subjects has been growing as researchers have proposed new names and theories. While Wilhelm van Maaren, a warehouse foreman, was the primary focus in both Dutch police investigations, the new investigation is open to all possibilities. \"When Otto Frank returned, in the summer of 1945, he assumed someone gave them up,\" said Gertjan Broek, a senior historian at the Anne Frank House, which receives 1.3 million visitors a year. \"It’s always been a firmly held belief.\" But while the idea that the police were tipped off has long been part of the Anne Frank story, not everyone is convinced that betrayal necessarily played a role. Dr. Broek published a 37-page report in December proposing the theory that the police were at the address on another mission, and found the lodgers only by chance. Researchers in the Netherlands have welcomed the new investigation, and Dr. Broek is serving as one of its advisers. \"What is new about this one is that it looks at the case with forensic eyes,\" Mr. Leopold said. \"And we look forward to the results.\" The investigative team — which also includes Roger Depue, a retired F.B.I. behavioral scientist, among its 20 members and consultants — hopes to reveal its progress on Aug. 4, 2019, exactly 75 years after the raid. Thijs Bayens, an organizer of the investigation and a filmmaker who plans to make a documentary about it, said the cost of the work would run into six digits, and the group is collecting donations on its website. Mr. Pankoke is keeping a diary of the investigation on the group’s website. During his 27-year career, Mr. Pankoke said, he worked on a squad aimed at Colombian drug traffickers in the 1990s and investigated the cellphone communications of the Sept. 11 hijackers. Working in an undercover unit, he played the part of a financier to investigate crimes on Wall Street. The new team has made progress already, Mr. Pankoke said. Someone claiming to be a neighbor of the now-famous annex left information on the investigators’ tip page that pointed to another nearby resident as having collaborated with Nazis. Mr. Pankoke said his team would follow up. He said he hoped that reopening the case would reawaken people’s awareness of the Holocaust, memories of which he fears are receding in an era of genocides and other atrocities. \"Part of the story is being lost to the sands of time,\" Mr. Pankoke said. \"If we accomplish nothing else — and I’m certain we will, I have a great team — we are bringing attention to the issue.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/anne-frank-cold-case-investigation.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'South Korea and China End Dispute Over Missile Defense System', 'text': ' SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea and China on Tuesday agreed to end a dispute over the deployment of an advanced American missile defense system in the South and to restore their economic and other ties. The agreement, unveiled following low-key negotiations involving Chinese and South Korean officials, removed a major obstacle in relations between Seoul and Beijing, one that has complicated international efforts to tame North Korea’s nuclear weapons ambitions. For years, China has vehemently protested the United States’ plan to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, system in South Korea, fearing it would undercut its own national security. After the United States and South Korea pressed ahead with the deployment in Seongju, 135 miles southeast of Seoul, the capital, in April, Chinese customers boycotted South Korean cars, movies and television dramas, as well as South Korean-run supermarkets. \"Both sides shared the view that the strengthening of exchange and cooperation between Korea and China serves their common interests and agreed to expeditiously bring exchange and cooperation in all areas back on a normal development track,\" said a statement from the South Korean Foreign Ministry on Tuesday. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also issued a similar statement announcing the agreement on Tuesday. For months, Seoul and Beijing appeared to have been deadlocked over their dispute over Thaad. China has insisted that South Korea remove the system, saying it could not tolerate its powerful radar on its door step. But South Korea said the Thaad system was essential to defending itself and American troops in South Korea from the growing nuclear and missile threats from North Korea, and called the matter nonnegotiable as long as those threats did not subside. The breakthrough came only days after President Xi Jinping of China emerged triumphant from the Communist Party congress this month, more confident than ever in his hold on power and in the pursuit of his foreign policy. The inauguration of Moon Jae-in, a liberal president of South Korea who has stressed the importance of relations with China, his country’s biggest trading partner, in May has also helped thaw relations. In a separate statement, Mr. Moon’s office said he would hold a summit meeting with Mr. Xi on the sidelines of a summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation countries in Vietnam on Nov. 10-11. Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha of South Korea first hinted at a possible breakthrough on Monday, when she said that despite the Thaad deployment, South Korea had no intention of joining the United States’ efforts to build a regionwide missile-defense system aimed at countering China’s expansion of its military capabilities. Ms. Kang also said South Korea would not accept any additional Thaad batteries. She also reiterated that South Korea would not enter any trilateral military alliance with the United States and Japan, something that Mr. Xi raised concerns about when he met Mr. Moon in July. The United States remains South Korea’s most important military ally. At Washington’s urging, South Korea and Japan have been expanding their military cooperation to better deal with North Korea’s missile threats. But South Korea has repeatedly stressed that it had no intention of entering a military alliance with Japan, its former colonial master, and has been wary of Japan’s ambitions, under its nationalist prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to increase its military profile in the region. Underscoring the continuing threat from North Korea’s nuclear program, the head of South Korea’s weather agency said on Monday that another powerful blast at the North’s underground test site could destabilize the area and send radioactive material into the atmosphere. \"Should another nuclear test take place, there is that possibility,\" Nam Jae-cheol, director of the Korea Meteorological Administration, told lawmakers inquiring about the potential for radioactive fallout. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, all of them in tunnels buried deep under Mount Mantap in Punggye-ri, in North Hamgyong Province.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test-radiation.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Nuclear Scientists Urge Congress to Protect Iran Deal', 'text': ' More than 90 top American experts in atomic sciences, including a designer of the hydrogen bomb, publicly threw their weight behind the Iran nuclear agreement on Monday, exhorting Congress to preserve the accord in the face of President Trump’s disavowal of it. In a letter to Senate and House leaders of both parties that emphasized the \"momentous responsibilities\" Congress bears regarding the agreement, the scientists asserted that the accord was effective in blocking Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon. \"Congress should act to ensure that the United States remains a party to the agreement,\" read the letter, signed by what amounted to a who’s who of prominent physicists and other luminaries in American science. The letter said the signers were offering their perspective \"as scientists who understand the physics and technology of nuclear power, of nuclear explosives, and of long-range missiles; and who collectively bring their experience with nuclear nonproliferation.\" They included Richard L. Garwin, a 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient and nonproliferation advocate, whose work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the early 1950s gave birth to the hydrogen bomb; all three winners of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics; and Siegfried S. Hecker, a former director of Los Alamos who is internationally regarded as an authority on nuclear security threats. Mr. Trump has described the 2015 agreement, negotiated under the Obama administration, as a giveaway to Iran and \"one of the worst\" deals ever, and has said it should be renegotiated or disbanded. He has criticized provisions of the agreement that expire over the next two decades and has complained that it does not ban Iranian missile development or stop other actions by Iran deemed to counter American interests. European allies of the United States that are parties to the nuclear agreement have urged the Trump administration to respect it. Iran has said the accord cannot be renegotiated. The scientists said Mr. Trump’s objections could be addressed without a renegotiation, which their letter called an \"unrealistic objective.\" Their letter reflected the intense lobbying underway in Congress by supporters and opponents of the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which lifted many sanctions on Iran in return for its verifiable promises of peaceful nuclear work. The lobbying has accelerated since Mr. Trump, as part of an aggressive new strategy to confront Iran, announced a few weeks ago that he would no longer certify Iran’s compliance with the agreement, as required every 90 days under an American law. Mr. Trump’s action essentially shifted the fate of the agreement to Congress, which may now reimpose sanctions on Iran in the next few months. Such a step may unravel the entire agreement. While the scientists did not dispute Mr. Trump’s objections, they emphasized that under the accord, severe restrictions on Iran’s supply of uranium remain in place through 2030, surveillance of Iran’s uranium-enriching centrifuges remains through 2035, and surveillance of uranium mines and mills through 2040. Iran will then remain subject to strong safeguards enforced by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear-monitoring arm of the United Nations. The agency has said Iran is complying with the nuclear agreement’s provisions. Iran has always asserted that it does not seek nuclear weapons. The scientists’ letter also recommended additional ways to monitor Iran — or any other non-nuclear state, for that matter — without renouncing the nuclear agreement. They proposed stronger verification at uranium enrichment plants in non-nuclear states, in addition to multinational control of such plants, which could \"provide an extra layer of security against their misuse to produce material for nuclear weapons.\" The Iran agreement, the scientists said, is \"necessary to provide the time needed to develop and implement these initiatives.\" Earlier Monday, prominent opponents of the nuclear agreement issued a statement expressing strong support for Mr. Trump’s position. Their statement said the agreement must be changed to address what they called deficiencies that put Iran \"on a legal glide path to a nuclear weapons arsenal.\" The statement was released by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based group that has strongly criticized Iran on a range of issues including the nuclear agreement. More than 20 former government officials and experts on Iran signed that statement, including Elliott Abrams, Robert G. Joseph and Mary Beth Long, who held high-ranking positions on security and defense under President George W. Bush’s administration; and Olli Heinonen, a former deputy director general at the International Atomic Energy Agency.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-scientists.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Afghan War Data, Once Public, Is Censored in U.S. Military Report', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — The American military command in Afghanistan has decided to keep secret key figures related to the growth and progress of local security forces, redacting the numbers at the behest of Afghan officials from the latest report by the government’s watchdog for spending. The move clouds measures of progress for the Afghan security forces, the primary benefactor of the $120 billion that the United States has spent on reconstruction since the start of the war and the linchpin of President Trump’s new strategy in Afghanistan. Backed by the American military and its NATO allies, the Afghans are responsible for turning the tide of the war against the Taliban in the coming years. Among the details being kept private in the report are the number of people in the Afghan army and police force, how many of them have been wounded or killed and the state of their equipment. \"The Afghans know what’s going on; the Taliban knows what’s going on; the U.S. military knows what’s going on,\" John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan, whose office compiled the quarterly report, said in an interview. \"The only people who don’t know what’s going on are the people paying for it.\" Capt. Tom Gresback of the Navy, the spokesman for American forces in Afghanistan, defended the decision to classify the information, saying that it was done at the Afghan government’s request. Mr. Sopko said: \"The government usually doesn’t classify good news. I don’t want any nameless, faceless Afghan bureaucrat telling the American taxpayer what they ought to know.\" The information has been classified only once before, in 2015, as the Obama administration was trying to portray the war in Afghanistan as all but over. At the time, as Taliban militants surged across the country, officials said that the figures, if made public, could endanger Afghan and American lives. While the quarterly reports have had a classified annex since 2015, most of the data categories redacted in the latest release have been available to the public since the inspector general started putting out the reports in 2008. This time, the numbers were kept secret as Mr. Trump ramps up the conflict, authorizing the deployment of thousands more troops and an expanded C.I.A. paramilitary campaign as well as overseeing a volume of airstrikes not seen since 2012. Mr. Sopko’s report includes nine questions — answered publicly in the past — that have now been redacted, including the exact number of Afghan forces serving. The number of combat casualties among the Afghan military and police, the primary forces battling Taliban and Islamic State militants in the country, were also classified. The total is one of the clearest indications of the ferocity of the war. From the beginning of the year through May 8, 2,531 members of the Afghan security forces were killed and 4,238 wounded, Mr. Sopko’s report in July said, adding that the Pentagon said Afghan casualties have \"steadily increased.\" That compares with more than 6,700 deaths among the Afghan security forces for all last year and around 12,000 wounded. The death tolls could hurt the morale of the troops and police as well as the government’s efforts to recruit for the roughly 330,000-member force. Long a problem for the Afghan army, the average attrition rate dropped from January to March, according to the previous inspector general report. In April, the equipment readiness for the six Afghan Corps — the largest organizational unit in the Afghan military at about 18,000 troops — ranged from 42 to 86 percent. The numbers are important bellwethers for the 16-year war effort, one that has been marked by military setbacks and a Taliban militancy that has held on — and even gained ground — despite the group’s technological disadvantage. It is unclear whether the American military will move to classify more information in future reports, said Mr. Sopko, as some of the redactions in the October report seemed arbitrary. \"If they start classifying this stuff now, what are they going to do next month?\" Mr. Sopko asked. \"It’s a slippery slope.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/asia/afghanistan-war-redacted-report.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Uhuru Kenyatta Is Declared Winner of Kenya’s Repeat Election', 'text': ' NAIROBI, Kenya — President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared on Monday the winner of Kenya’s presidential election — for the second time this year. Mr. Kenyatta received nearly 7.5 million votes in the repeated vote, held last week, the national elections commission announced. Mr. Kenyatta also won the first election, in August, by 1.4 million votes. But the opposition leader, Raila Odinga, challenged the results, and the Supreme Court nullified the election in September, citing irregularities. Backers of Mr. Kenyatta interpreted both of his wins as broad national support for the president, but opposition supporters said they had twice been disenfranchised by a process that lacked credibility. Mr. Odinga withdrew from the second election two weeks before the vote, arguing that the electoral commission could not oversee a free and fair process, and he called on his supporters to boycott. His name nevertheless appeared on the ballot, and he collected just over 73,000 votes, compared with nearly seven million in August. Elections officials also cast doubt on the credibility of the process in the days before the vote. One commissioner fled the country and resigned, citing death threats and questioning the impartiality of the commission. The top elections official, Wafula Chebukati, warned a week before the polls opened that political interference in the commission’s work was likely to undermine the credibility and neutrality of the vote. Mr. Chebukati backtracked on that criticism while announcing the results on Monday, declaring the process \"free and fair.\" At least 14 people have been killed in election-related violence since the Oct. 26 vote, according to international officials, and more have been injured. The rights group Amnesty International said on Monday that it had documented at least four deaths and more than a dozen injuries since the election that it said were committed by the police, most of them in western Kenya. Government figures put the death toll at 10. Rights groups documented nearly 70 deaths that they said occurred at the hands of the police in the days after the August vote. In his victory speech, Mr. Kenyatta boasted of his August victory and recast the Supreme Court’s nullification as an endorsement of his win. \"The numbers were never questioned,\" Mr. Kenyatta said. \"What the court questioned was the process of declaring my victory.\" On Saturday, violence broke out in the Kawangware neighborhood of Nairobi, where several people were wounded and a supermarket was burned down. Residents blamed people from Mr. Kenyatta’s ethnic group, the Kikuyu, from which he draws strong support. One Western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of protocol, expressed concern that the violence had taken on a more ethnic overtone in the days after the election. Martin Kimani, the director of the Kenyan national counterterrorism center, said that opposition supporters had provoked the violence. On Sunday, he accused Mr. Odinga of \"dog-whistle politics\" aimed at inciting ethnic violence and obstructing the vote. \"This is active sabotage of an election,\" he said. \"The dog whistle comes from the top, and the middle and lower levels act on it.\" Four counties in western Kenya, an opposition stronghold representing 1.6 million votes, were unable to participate in the second election. In some places on Election Day, opposition demonstrators erected roadblocks and intercepted ballot papers. In others, polling stations were blockaded, and protesters clashed with the police. Electoral officials at first delayed balloting in those counties and eventually canceled it completely, saying the outcome in those areas would not affect the overall result. Mr. Odinga told his supporters last week that he would transform his party into a \"resistance movement.\" In speeches in Kawangware on Sunday, he pinned the violence there on his opponents. \"The killing here was very beastly,\" he told a crowd gathered at a church. \"The killing was well planned and executed,\" he said, and was intended as \"a direct warning to others.\" Mr. Odinga condemned the violence, which he described as perpetrated by Kenyatta supporters, but stopped short of urging his own supporters not to react with violence. Kenyans, foreign diplomats and even some of Mr. Kenyatta’s own supporters have called on the president to engage with opposition leaders after his win, but in his victory speech the president distanced himself from dialogue. \"Those who want to ask me, ‘Are you going to engage in dialogue with so and so and so and so?’, let them first and foremost exhaust the constitutionally laid out processes,\" Mr. Kenyatta said. \"I am not going to jump the gun.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/africa/kenya-election-kenyatta-odinga.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Benghazi Attacks Suspect Is Captured in Libya by U.S. Commandos', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — American commandos captured a suspect in the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, the Trump administration said on Monday, bringing into custody a second man accused in the terrorist attacks that have been used by Republicans as a political spear against the Obama administration. The man, Mustafa al-Imam, was caught on Sunday in the area of Misurata, Libya, brought aboard a United States warship and will be taken to the United States to face criminal charges, American officials said. Four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, were killed in the bloody September 2012 assaults at a diplomatic compound and a C.I.A. base a mile away that came under heavy fire. More than a dozen people have been charged, and one is standing trial. \"To the families of these fallen heroes: I want you to know that your loved ones are not forgotten, and they will never be forgotten,\" President Trump said in a statement on Monday. \"Our memory is deep and our reach is long, and we will not rest in our efforts to find and bring the perpetrators of the heinous attacks in Benghazi to justice.\" The team of commandos — members of the Navy SEAL team 6 and the F.B.I.’s Hostage Rescue Team — surprised Mr. Imam, several officials said. One said Mr. Imam was subdued. Details about the operation were limited, but the officials said that plans to apprehend him had been in the works for months as the American military waited for authorization from the White House. Officials said Mr. Imam was living in Tripoli and had recently traveled to Misurata, a coastal city between Tripoli and Benghazi. The military’s Joint Special Operations Command had been watching him closely, along with others thought to have participated in the attacks. The arrest shows that Mr. Trump, who vowed during his campaign to fill the wartime prison at Guantánamo Bay with \"bad dudes,\" is willing to use civilian courts to prosecute terrorism suspects captured overseas. The capture also marks a victory for F.B.I. officials, who had feared that such prosecutions would stagnate under Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions has said for years that terrorism suspects should be held and prosecuted at Guantánamo Bay. He has said that terrorists do not deserve the same legal rights as common criminals and that such trials were too dangerous to hold in the United States. Earlier this year, the United States extradited a man suspected of belonging to Al Qaeda from Spain to stand trial in the United States. European allies refuse to release suspects to be sent to the prison at Guantánamo Bay, complicating Mr. Trump’s rhetoric about filling the prison but demonstrating the realities of fighting terrorism in 2017. The F.B.I.’s Hostage Rescue Team has worked closely for years with the military’s elite units to make such arrests. In 2013, the F.B.I. team took part in an operation to arrest Ahmed Abu Khattala, who was charged in the Benghazi attack and is being tried in Federal District Court in Washington. If convicted, Mr. Khattala faces a potential sentence of life in prison. It was not clear how the arrest of a second suspect could affect Mr. Khattala’s trial. But officials said Mr. Imam was one of the men filmed entering and leaving the diplomatic compound the night of the attack and was an associate of Mr. Khattala. Mr. Imam, who is about 46, is accused of taking part in the attacks on the diplomatic compound and the C.I.A. base, according to prosecutors. He is charged in a criminal complaint with killing a person in the course of an attack on a federal facility involving the use of a firearm and dangerous weapon; conspiring to provide material support to terrorists resulting in death; and possession of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. To capture Mr. Khattala, an F.B.I. agent and several Delta Force operators snatched him from a beachside villa on Libya’s coast, and Navy SEALs took him to a waiting warship, where he was interrogated. In another operation, Delta Force commandos and the F.B.I. captured an Al Qaeda suspect in 2013 as he returned home from morning prayers. He was taken to an American warship and had to be quickly flown to the United States because of serious health problems. He later died of liver cancer before he could stand trial.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/africa/benghazi-attacks-second-suspect-captured.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'us': [{'title': 'New Accusers Expand Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Claims Back to ’70s', 'text': ' Hope Exiner d’Amore said Harvey Weinstein raped her in a hotel room in the 1970s, when he was a young concert promoter in Buffalo. Cynthia Burr said that during this time, he assaulted her in an encounter that began in an elevator and ended with forced oral sex in a hallway. Ashley Matthau, a dancer with a bit part in one of his movies, said that in 2004, he pushed her down on a bed and masturbated while straddling her. Days later, she said, he paid her to remain silent. Three weeks after complaints of sexual harassment and misconduct by Mr. Weinstein were first reported in The New York Times, women from different continents, fields and generations have come forward with allegations of rape, sexual assault and groping. New accounts include one previously undisclosed settlement with Mr. Weinstein and expand the time frame of alleged wrongdoing to the 1970s. Together, the accounts provide a widening tally of alleged abuses, and illustrate the toll on women who say they felt ashamed and isolated as they watched the Hollywood producer walk red carpets, pile up Oscars and showcase his ties to prominent figures. \"This has haunted me my entire life,\" said Ms. Exiner d’Amore, now 62, who was in her early 20s at the time of the alleged rape. She and three other women who spoke to The Times described Mr. Weinstein as inappropriate and unrelenting. Some said that he used the pretext of work to lure them to hotels, that he touched them or forced them into unwanted sexual activity and that he wouldn’t stop when they said no. Ms. Matthau, the dancer who reached a settlement with Mr. Weinstein, said she was willing to break its confidentiality clause even if it meant that he might pursue legal damages. \"I want to do my part to help bring this to light so it doesn’t happen with other people in Hollywood or anywhere else,\" she said in an interview. The allegations add to those previously documented in The Times, The New Yorker and elsewhere. Last week, the actress Dominique Huett filed a lawsuit claiming that in 2010, Mr. Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. The same day, Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant of Mr. Weinstein’s, appeared at a news conference in New York accusing him of the same behavior in 2006. The New York Police Department is conducting a wide-ranging investigation of allegations against Mr. Weinstein. Detectives with expertise in old cases are reviewing complaints that have come through the department’s hotline, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In New York, the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other sex crimes depends on the force alleged and the charges considered, but it can range from two years to no time restrictions for the most serious offenses. Ms. Burr, the woman involved in the hallway encounter in the 1970s, said that she contacted the New York police in recent weeks and that they told her the alleged assault had happened too long ago to be prosecuted. Women have also spoken to law enforcement authorities in London, Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States. The London police are investigating three sexual assault cases involving Mr. Weinstein, ranging from the 1980s to 2015. Mr. Weinstein’s spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said in a statement that \"any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.\" For 40 years, Cynthia Burr has almost never talked about the time she met Mr. Weinstein. But she didn’t forget how he greeted her in the lobby of a beautiful old building in New York City. How he tried to kiss her in the elevator. And how, she said, he unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex in a hallway. \"It was just him and me alone,\" she said. \"I was fearful I didn’t have the wherewithal to get away.\" It was the late 1970s, and Ms. Burr was an actress in her early 20s. Mr. Weinstein was in his mid-20s and a \"real up-and-comer,\" Ms. Burr remembers. Her manager said they should meet. After the encounter, she recalls feeling ashamed. \"The way he forced me made me feel really bad about myself,\" she said. \"What are you going to do when you are a girl just trying to make it as an actress? Nobody would have believed me.\" Ms. Burr, now 62, went on to build a career in Hollywood. She appeared in \"Scarface\" and the first two \"Lethal Weapon\" films, and in soap operas and other television shows. Eventually, she told her husband, now deceased, and a close friend, Lee Chavez, what had happened. Mr. Chavez confirmed that she had told him her account about 10 years ago. \"I’m really sad for everybody, but I’m really glad it’s out in the open,\" Ms. Burr said about learning of the other allegations against Mr. Weinstein. \"I finally felt like I had a voice.\" Ms. Exiner d’Amore had worked for Mr. Weinstein for just a few weeks when he asked if she’d like to take a trip to New York City. Both of them were in their 20s, living in Buffalo in the late 1970s. She was working for Mr. Weinstein’s concert promotion company, Harvey and Corky Productions, doing odd jobs. She was interested in film, so when Mr. Weinstein asked if she wanted to come to New York City to meet with people in the industry, she agreed. When they got to the Park Lane Hotel, Mr. Weinstein went to the check-in desk while she waited elsewhere in the lobby, Ms. Exiner d’Amore recalled. He returned and said there had been a mistake with the reservations; there was only one room. They would have to share. \"I gave him a look like that was ridiculous,\" she recalled. But she ultimately agreed, assuming it was harmless. When she got into bed that night, she said, he slipped in next to her, naked. \"I told him no. I kept pushing him away. He just wouldn’t listen,\" Ms. Exiner d’Amore said. \"He just forced himself on me.\" She said he forcibly performed oral sex and intercourse on her. She did not tell her boyfriend, feeling ashamed, but she did confide in her next-door neighbors in Buffalo. She did not specifically say she was raped, but the couple, David and Irene Sipos, told The Times that they remembered her being extremely upset and crying when she told them about Mr. Weinstein and the hotel room. After the trip, Ms. Exiner d’Amore said, Mr. Weinstein kept asking her out and offered her credit cards to go on shopping sprees. She declined. Within three or four weeks, she was fired. \"It was a relief,\" she said. \"I hated being there.\" Ms. Exiner d’Amore never went into the film industry. She got a job administering an undergraduate program at Cornell, and later moved on to jobs in fund-raising. Ashley Matthau said that Mr. Weinstein was aggressive with her the moment they met in 2004. She was in Puerto Rico performing in \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\" when Mr. Weinstein visited the set. As soon as he saw her, she said, he began pressuring her to come to his hotel room for a private meeting. Ms. Matthau, who then went by her maiden name, Anderson, said she tried to brush him off, explaining that she was engaged. She said he persisted. When the cast broke for a meal, Ms. Matthau told some production members that Mr. Weinstein was being pushy and she was afraid. No one offered to help, she said, and when she returned to the set, Mr. Weinstein instructed her to get into a car. \"‘Don’t worry,’\" Ms. Matthau, now 36, remembers him saying as they sat in the back seat. \"‘Nothing is going to happen. We’re just going to discuss future projects.’\" She said they went to his hotel room, where talk quickly became sexual: Mr. Weinstein told her that he had helped launch the careers of high-profile actresses who had slept with him, and that she should consider doing the same. When she declined, Mr. Weinstein pushed her onto the bed and fondled her breasts, she said. He then stripped, straddled her and masturbated on top of her. \"I kept telling him, ‘Stop, I’m engaged,’ but he kept saying: ‘It’s just a little cuddling. It’s not a problem. It’s not like we’re having sex.’ \" Back in California days later, Ms. Matthau tearfully told her fiancé, Charles Matthau, a general description of what had happened. Mr. Matthau said in an interview that he was outraged. With his encouragement, Ms. Matthau retained John S. West, a partner in the law firm of Gloria Allred, who has a record of taking on powerful men. Soon, Ms. Matthau recalled, she and Mr. West met at the Peninsula Beverly Hills with Mr. Weinstein and Daniel M. Petrocelli, who had represented high-profile clients including Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron. The experience, she said, was chilling. She had attended a couple of parties at the Playboy Mansion, and Mr. Petrocelli said she would be painted as promiscuous if she went public with her accusation against Mr. Weinstein. \"‘We’ll drag you through the mud by your hair,’\" she recalled the lawyer saying. Mr. Petrocelli declined to comment. Going up against such powerful men felt like more than she could handle. Ms. Matthau said she agreed to enter into a more than $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in exchange for a legally binding promise never to speak of the allegations again. Lacey Dorn moved to New York City in 2011, soon after graduating from Stanford University, where she had helped create two documentaries. Ms. Dorn, then 22, was introduced to Mr. Weinstein at a New York Film Festival party A few weeks later, Ms. Dorn attended a Halloween party at the Gramercy Park Hotel and ran into Mr. Weinstein, who asked for her email. He wanted to talk about her career over lunch, she said. \"Great meeting you,\" he wrote in the subject line of an otherwise blank email sent to her at 12:26 a.m. On her way out of the party, Ms. Dorn said goodbye to Mr. Weinstein. As she turned her back to him, he grabbed between her legs, touching her buttocks and crotch through her clothes. \"I was so naïve, I didn’t say anything. And he didn’t say anything either,\" she said. \"I just got out of the party as fast as possible.\" Ms. Dorn said she never heard from Mr. Weinstein and never spoke to him again. Ms. Dorn said that when she told friends what had happened, many seemed to shrug it off as if it were a \"rite of passage,\" an acknowledgment of how \"awful\" the entertainment business could be.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-allegations.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '‘I Called the Police Last Week’: After Weinstein Reports, Women Take Action', 'text': ' The Reader Center is a newsroom initiative that is helping The Times build deeper ties with our audience.

Another emailed an old co-worker to tell him she felt his behavior was sexual harassment. After allegations of sexual harassment and assault by the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein came to light a little over two weeks ago, stories of \"Me Too\" have flooded social media, leading many, including a group of women in the California legislature, to publicly declare, \"Enough.\" We asked our readers to share their stories of the ripple effects, big and small, of the Weinstein reports. We heard from more than 200 readers. Here is a selection of the responses, which have been edited for length and clarity, and to protect the identities of those involved. Women are now confronting their abusers. I sent a letter this morning to a man I \"dated\" who sexually assaulted me many years ago. He was and is a very powerful and successful man. I haven’t spoken to him in at least a decade, probably more. I wish I had a stronger voice back then, but I didn’t. I have it now. — Anonymous, California I emailed an ex-co-worker and explained that his behavior had been sexual harassment in the workplace. — Harmony Powell, Vancouver, Canada Some women are reporting crimes and abuses when they hadn’t before. I was raped by my boss on a business trip in 2015. He was terminated after I told H.R., but they also advised me not to say anything because he might sue me. I chose to leave the company, and I was too distraught and scared to go to the police. It has taken me two years of therapy to figure out how to move on. I had planned to call the police before the Weinstein story broke, actually; but the wave of solidarity became an anchor of strength. I called the police last week and am waiting for my case to be assigned to a detective. I know I won’t find my peace through celebrity, money or even through the justice system. But I can use my voice to join the chorus and ask for this to stop. — Anonymous, Washington Twenty-six years ago I was raped by a classmate at my high school prom. Last week, I decided to approach the District Attorney’s office about reopening my case. I had been uncertain, but after the Weinstein story broke and momentum from other victims mounted, I am now determined. Even as a newspaper reporter myself, covering crime for 12 years, I fought to report on other people’s cases more than I have my own — until now. — Leslie Parrilla, Riverside County, Calif. A woman who said she had been sexually harassed via text and in person by a supervisor for more than two years resolved to report the abuse. When I read the story of Harvey Weinstein, when I saw the words \"me too,\" something inside me broke. I insisted on a meeting with the C.E.O. of my company, the only person above this man. Shaking, I recounted my story to him. As a survivor of rape, sexual assault and now sexual harassment, I haven’t been comfortable enough to write \"me too.\" I don’t want to relive any of those experiences, but there are some things that need to be shared. — Sarah D., Brooklyn, N.Y. Women are finding places to talk. I was drugged and raped by a neighbor when I was 21 years old. My mother has told me her rape story (it was the late ’60s in Los Angeles). I know my grandmother and my aunt were raped many years ago in Los Angeles. The statistics around rape are staggering, but the numbers in my family alone are even more disturbing. This Harvey Weinstein story has brought up a lot of trauma for me. I feel the pain of all women right now. I was talking to my husband last night; he thinks I should see a therapist. Today, I am looking for a counselor. — Alex, San Jose, Calif. I decided I could no longer keep quiet about the many incidents of harassment I have endured.

Mr. Spacey, who has long been fiercely private about his personal life, said in a statement that he did not remember any such encounter, but added that Mr. Rapp’s accusation \"has encouraged me to address other things about my life.\" He then disclosed that he had \"loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man.\" The rapid cycle of accusation and apology began Sunday evening, when BuzzFeed published an article in which Mr. Rapp alleged that Mr. Spacey \"was trying to get with me sexually\" after a party at Mr. Spacey’s apartment in 1986. After all the other guests had left, Mr. Rapp said that Mr. Spacey, who appeared intoxicated, \"picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don’t, like, squirm away initially, because I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ And then he lays down on top of me.\" Mr. Rapp, who is best known for playing the character Mark Cohen in the original Broadway production of \"Rent,\" confirmed the contents of the article and said he had decided to speak out at a time when several women have accused the producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault. \"I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out, to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me,\" Mr. Rapp said in an emailed statement. \"Everything I wanted to say about my experience is in that article, and I have no further comment about it at this time.\" Mr. Spacey had not responded to requests for comment from BuzzFeed. But a few hours after the article was published, he posted a statement to Twitter, saying he was \"horrified\" but did not remember the encounter. Mr. Rapp said he met Mr. Spacey in 1986 when both were performing in Broadway shows. Mr. Rapp was a child actor in a new play called \"Precious Sons,\" while Mr. Spacey, then 26, was performing in a revival of \"Long Day’s Journey Into Night.\" Mr. Rapp told BuzzFeed that he met Mr. Spacey at a Broadway party that year, and that Mr. Spacey invited him to the party where the sexual advance occurred. Erin Quill, an actress, said Mr. Rapp told her of his allegation years ago. \"He told me the story in 1992 and I stand by Anthony’s account,\" she said in an email on Sunday night. Mr. Spacey, now 58, is a well-known actor who hosted this year’s Tony Awards; he won his Oscars in 1996 for \"The Usual Suspects\" and in 2000 for \"American Beauty,\" as well as a Tony Award in 1991 for \"Lost in Yonkers.\" He currently stars as Frank Underwood on \"House of Cards.\" Mr. Rapp, now 46, is currently featured on the television series \"Star Trek: Discovery.\" Mr. Spacey’s decision to cite homosexuality as part of a response to an accusation that he made a sexual advance on a minor drew criticism from some on social media.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/theater/kevin-spacey-gay-anthony-rapp.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Hamilton Fish of The New Republic Goes on Leave After Women’s Complaints', 'text': ' Hamilton Fish, the president and publisher of The New Republic, is taking a leave of absence pending an investigation into complaints by female employees at the magazine, according to a letter sent to its staff on Sunday night. In the letter, Win McCormack, the magazine’s owner, said he had asked Mr. Fish to \"remain on a leave of absence,\" effective immediately, pending an independent investigation into recent complaints from women concerning interactions with Mr. Fish. \"I have been made aware that a number of employees have come forward in the last few days to express concern about certain workplace interactions that have created an uncomfortable environment for them,\" Mr. McCormack wrote. \"As I understand them, these concerns relate specifically to interactions between Ham Fish and a number of women employees.\" Mr. McCormack added: \"I appreciate the candor our employees have displayed in coming forward with their concerns, and I take the concerns very seriously.\" When reached by email, Mr. Fish declined to comment. The concerns about Mr. Fish’s behavior are the latest in a torrent of complaints by women about sexual misconduct by powerful men in the media industry that have emerged in the three weeks since reports surfaced about the alleged sexual misconduct of the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The complaints from female employees about Mr. Fish also come less than a week after Leon Wieseltier, a prominent longtime editor at The New Republic, issued an apology after a number of women accused him of sexual misconduct.

Bergdahl’s Sentence May Be Lighter Because of Trump’s Comments', 'text': ' FORT BRAGG, N.C. — President Trump’s harsh criticism of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked off his Army post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, will weigh in favor of a lighter sentence for the sergeant, a military judge said on Monday. \"I will consider the president’s comments as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence,\" the judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army, said during a hearing at Fort Bragg. The judge is expected to sentence Sergeant Bergdahl in the next few weeks. The judge rejected a request that he dismiss the case or cap the length of the sentence on the grounds that the president’s comments had precluded a fair hearing. The judge said he had not been influenced by the remarks and that the public’s confidence in the military justice system had not been undermined. Sergeant Bergdahl faces up to life imprisonment. He pleaded guilty on Oct. 16 to desertion and endangering the troops who were sent to search for him. He testified on Monday that he deeply regretted that people \"suffered because of my bad choices.\" \"I’m admitting I made a horrible mistake,\" the sergeant said on the witness stand. \"It was never my intention for anyone to be hurt, and I never expected that to happen.\" As a candidate, Mr. Trump repeatedly called Sergeant Bergdahl a traitor and suggested that he should be executed or returned to the Taliban. On Oct. 16, Mr. Trump seemed to endorse those earlier sentiments, declining to say anything new about the case but adding, \"I think people have heard my comments in the past.\" An Army investigator initially recommended that there be no jail time for Sergeant Bergdahl, who was held and tortured by the Taliban for five years. But anger — on the part of politicians and members of the military — over the sergeant’s actions may have contributed to the fact that he now faces the possibility of a long sentence. In sentencing, mitigating factors weigh in favor of leniency while aggravating factors tip the scales toward harsher punishment. The judge’s decision means he will weigh Mr. Trump’s comments along with other mitigating factors presented by the defense, including evidence that Sergeant Bergdahl had a severe mental disorder and suffered torture in captivity. Colonel Nance will also consider aggravating factors presented by the prosecution, including injuries suffered by several service members during the search for Sergeant Bergdahl, as well as the negative impact they say the search had on the military’s overall war effort in Afghanistan. Anger over the injuries has driven much of the testimony in the case so far, as service members vividly described a rescue operation that exposed them to enemy fire. Shannon Allen, the wife of Sgt. First Class Mark Allen, who was shot in the head took the stand on Monday. Sergeant Allen, a national guardsman from Georgia, had part of his brain removed during surgery, and is now unable to speak, walk, or take care of himself. His wife has said little publicly, but in a Facebook post after Sergeant Bergdahl was freed, she blamed him for causing her husband’s incapacitation. \"Instead of being his wife, I have become his caregiver,\" Ms. Allen testified on Monday. Last week, Staff Sgt. Jason Walters testified that his six-man team had only just arrived in Afghanistan when they were sent to search for Sergeant Bergdahl. They had little time to prepare for the rugged terrain of Paktika Province, and little intelligence to go on. On the second morning of the search, \"an insane amount of fire came out of nowhere,\" Sergeant Walters said. Militants had them surrounded. In minutes, half the team had been wounded. Sergeant Walters turned to see \"a cloud of blood\" spraying from the head of Sergeant Allen. \"I started treating his wounds, talking to him, telling him to hang on,\" Sergeant Walters said. The battle subsided only after F-15 fighter jets and Apache helicopters arrived overhead. Only later would the troops learn that the battalion responsible for the area believed that 150 Taliban fighters were near the village where the soldiers were resting when they came under fire. \"My words can’t take away what people have been through,\" Sergeant Bergdahl told the court on Monday. \"Offering condolences is not enough. People went through things they shouldn’t have had to go through. I grieve for those who have suffered and their families.\" The Army’s investigation of the rescue operation described faults with its planning, preparation, equipment and intelligence. Sergeant Bergdahl’s defense team has also argued to the judge that the Taliban — not their client — were directly responsible for Sergeant Allen’s wounds. Prosecutors have sought to show that the attack would have played out similarly even without the problems cited. Increased risks were acceptable, they say, if the missing soldier was thought to be near. But in the immediate aftermath of the attack, the investigation showed, some of Sergeant Allen’s comrades were upset with the officers who ordered the operation. \"We should have never went out there in the first place, and we would not have lost three of our guys in the process,\" said Staff Sgt. Travis Scott Elmore, referring to the wounded. He was one of the six-member Embedded Training Team, or E.T.T. He had been told only afterward that the battalion responsible for that area believed there were 150 Taliban fighters nearby. \"We didn’t have the manpower, and that was the first mission that our E.T.T. team has ever conducted\" with Afghan troops, he said in a sworn statement to Army investigators. Sergeant Walters suggested that commanders never would have sent their own men from the battalion on such a high-risk patrol. \"They treat us like a redheaded stepchild whose only purpose there is to be used at their convenience and for the missions they don’t want to risk their own men on,\" he wrote in his statement. In court, Sergeant Bergdahl gave details about his captivity, saying that he had once used a nail sharpened with a rock to pick the locks on his shackles and escape. He had planned to subsist on grass, he said, but because the area was heavily populated by herds of sheep and goats, there was little available. He fell off a cliff into a dry riverbed, he said. After eight days at large, he would \"black out and fall over\" when he tried to stand up. When he was recaptured, the Taliban beat him and placed him in a cage that would be his home for the next four years, he said. Another search for Sergeant Bergdahl, this one conducted at night, was recounted last week by Jimmy Hatch, who was a Senior Chief Petty Officer and member of a Navy SEAL special operations team. After helicopters dropped off his team, Chief Hatch sent his military working dog after two people he suspected were enemy fighters. One shot the dog in the head. The other sprayed his gun wildly. The muzzle flashes allowed American troops to locate and kill the fighters — but not before one shot Chief Hatch, shattering his thighbone, he said. He would later have 18 surgical procedures, and still walks with a pronounced limp. \"I was worse than useless,\" Chief Hatch said, recalling his fear that his screams might endanger fellow troops. Specialist Jonathan Morita, whose finger bones shattered when an unexploded rocket-propelled grenade struck his hand, has regained only limited use of his hand. Specialist Morita testified that he suffers from a short temper because of his experience. He said his anger is directed \"toward one person.\" He did not name names. But as he left the witness stand and walked past the defense table, he shot Sergeant Bergdahl a withering glare.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/bowe-bergdahl-search-attack.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'U.S. Response to Storm-Hit Puerto Rico Is Criticized by U.N. Experts', 'text': ' GENEVA — United Nations experts faulted the United States’ response to hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico in a report on Monday, calling it ineffective and lagging far behind the support provided for storm-struck states on the mainland. More than five weeks after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico with winds of up to 155 miles an hour, conditions remained \"alarming\" for the island’s 3.5 million people, the group of 11 United Nations independent experts said, calling for a \"speedy and well-resourced emergency response.\" Thousands left homeless by the storm had no relief in sight, few of the island’s hospitals were functioning, and there were reports that available water supplies were contaminated, the experts said in a statement. About 30 percent of the normal electric power is being generated on the island, officials in Puerto Rico say. \"We can’t fail to note the dissimilar urgency and priority given to the emergency response in Puerto Rico, compared to the U.S. states affected by hurricanes in recent months,\" said Leilani Farha, the United Nations special rapporteur on housing. The critical report comes as questions continue to swirl around a $300 million contract to help rebuild Puerto Rico’s power grid that was given to a small Montana company. Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló announced on Sunday that he had decided to cancel the disaster-recovery deal that Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the public power company known as Prepa, signed with Whitefish Energy Holdings.  He said the controversy had begun to detract from the work being done to restore power on the island. Soon after the deal with Whitefish was announced, questions were raised as to how a two-man company from Montana managed to secure such a lucrative contract. The company has ties to the secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, but both sides say there was no wrongdoing. A House committee is investigating, and the governor has asked the island’s comptroller and the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security to also review the deal. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported on Monday that F.B.I. agents from the San Juan field office were investigating the contract, but such an investigation could not be confirmed. The F.B.I. national office referred questions about the report to the Puerto Rico field office. A spokesman there, Carlos Osorio, said the agency could not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. \"While Whitefish is not aware of any such investigation, Whitefish is committed to full cooperation with any inquiry or investigation,\" the company said in a statement. \"The procurement of the Prepa contract was at all times fully appropriate. Our focus continues to be on our work in Puerto Rico completing the work Prepa has tasked Whitefish to complete including the repair of the second major transmission line.\" A spokeswoman for the power authority said the agency had no information about an investigation, and therefore had no comment. The governor’s office said it welcomed an inquiry. \"We have not received any information about the F.B.I. looking into the contract, but Governor Rosselló welcomes any investigation by the federal authorities and he has been clear: There should be an investigation on this matter, and if there is any wrongdoing, the persons responsible should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,\" Yennifer Álvarez, the governor’s spokeswoman, said. \"That’s why the Governor has asked for investigations by the Comptroller of Puerto Rico and the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, John Roth.\" In a phone interview, Ms. Farha, an independent expert reporting to the United Nations, said it was \"very worrying\" that she had not been able to obtain clarity on the number of people who were still homeless after the storm. She noted that estimates of the number of houses destroyed ranged from 30,000 to 90,000. Thousands of engineers had been deployed in Texas and Florida to reconnect homes to the electricity grid after hurricanes hit those states, a number far in excess of the crews deployed to Puerto Rico. \"FEMA is overall responsible,\" Ms. Farha said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \"I don’t understand why FEMA can respond so quickly and affirmatively in Texas and why they weren’t deployed similarly in Puerto Rico.\" Officials have said that deploying utility crews to an island posed far greater challenges than getting them to communities on the mainland.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/puerto-rico-whitefish-fbi-power-.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'How a Republican Idea for Reducing Medicare Costs Could Affect You', 'text': ' Last month, as Republican leaders were preoccupied with another unsuccessful attempt to replace Obamacare, a senior Trump administration official issued a warning about a different major medical program, Medicare. The official, Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, wrote in The Wall Street Journal  that Medicare was facing a fiscal crisis. She announced that she was asking the agency’s innovation center for ideas to address it, and that part of the answer was to give consumers \"incentives to be cost-conscious.\" This has some Democrats worried that she’s trying to move Medicare toward something called premium support, which would be a huge change for consumers. Before we get into the pros and cons, what’s the fiscal crisis? According to projections from this year’s Medicare Trustees’ report, the fund that pays for Medicare-financed hospital care will be depleted in 12 years, and care for other services will consume an ever-larger share of the economy and federal revenue. Citing trends like those, Republicans included the outlines of a Medicare premium support plan  in the House of Representatives’ fiscal year 2018 budget resolution, as they did in several prior ones. In broad terms, \"premium support\" means the government pays a contribution toward premiums, and beneficiaries pay the rest. In a sense, today’s Medicare program already has such a structure. For either the traditional program or a private Medicare Advantage plan, the government pays a preset premium stipend (alternatively called a subsidy, credit or voucher) that varies across these two parts of the program. In all cases, stipends grow at the rate of health care costs. If Medicare already has a form of a premium support model, what’s all the fuss about? The important difference is in how stipend levels are set. Today’s stipends are not driven by the market, but are set according to legislatively established formulas. But the type of premium support Medicare reformers usually advocate — what people generally mean when they use this term — would use market signals to set stipend levels. \"Premium support could result in increased efficiency in the Medicare program,\" said Bryan Dowd, a health economist at the University of Minnesota, and co-author of a book that analyzed various premium support options. That efficiency could push the hospital trust fund depletion date further into the future and reduce \"the financial burden on future generations.\" Premium support models take many forms, but there are two crucial variables. One is how stipend levels are set, which determines how much of beneficiaries’ own money they need to contribute. The other key feature of premium support is how much the stipend grows over time. Both aspects are hotly debated. In some versions of premium support, the stipend level would grow more slowly than health care costs, forcing people to pay more out of pocket over time to purchase coverage. In other versions, the stipend level would grow at the same rate as health care costs, so beneficiaries would continue to pay about the same share of their own money for health insurance. Most premium support approaches would retain traditional Medicare, though its fate would be uncertain, a source of controversy. \"A lot rides on how the government’s support level differentially impacts the cost to beneficiaries of private plans versus traditional Medicare,\" said Timothy McBride, a health economist with Washington University in St. Louis. Geography also plays a role. \"If traditional Medicare is disadvantaged, that would hit rural beneficiaries harder, because a larger share of rural America relies on the traditional program than do urban Americans.\" As a report this month from the Congressional Budget Office reveals, how much premium support could save the government varies considerably depending on how stipend levels are established. Across the variations the C.B.O. examined, Medicare spending could fall by as much as 9 percent or as little as about 0.5 percent. But premiums could rise, including the premium for traditional Medicare. Under one projection, the C.B.O. estimates, traditional Medicare’s premium could double. In all the scenarios the C.B.O. analyzed, stipend levels would be based on bids from Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare that reflect the cost to cover a person for standard Medicare services. Stipend levels would keep pace with overall health care costs, but they could still be lower than what many Medicare beneficiaries receive today. For example, tying the stipend to the second-lowest bid and requiring all Medicare beneficiaries to be subject to that new, lower level would save $419 billion over 2022-2026, the C.B.O. estimated. Tying it to the average bid or requiring only new beneficiaries to be subject to the new stipend would save less. In either case, people would have access to plans that don’t cost more than today’s. But those who opted for more expensive plans because they offer more benefits, or the traditional program because it covers any doctor willing to accept Medicare patients, would pay more out of pocket. Consequently, more people would opt for cheaper, private plans — and fewer would choose traditional Medicare. This worries some health policy experts. \"Traditional Medicare has been the leader in reforming the health care payment and delivery system to improve efficiency,\" said Paul Van de Water, senior fellow with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"It has outperformed private insurance in holding down the growth of health costs, but its ability to continue to do that would shrink significantly if premium support caused its enrollment to dwindle.\" Exactly how much more people would pay depends not only on the plans they select, but also on where they live. In some markets, many plans, including the traditional program, might charge premiums close to the second-lowest bid. In others, plans that many beneficiaries may want might cost a lot more. In the premium support debate, there’s a fundamental lesson: It’s conceptually simple to reduce federal spending on health care, but it’s very hard to do so in a way that doesn’t increase costs for at least some consumers. To actually reduce total (not just federal) health care spending for everyone, one has to overhaul how care is delivered, not just how it is paid for. That’s much harder.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/upshot/how-a-republican-idea-for-reducing-medicare-costs-could-affect-you.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '', 'text': '', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/timeline-charges-special-counsel-mueller.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Paul Manafort’s Ambition Set the Stage for His Downfall', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — In February 2016, after decades of lucrative paydays from foreign clients, Paul Manafort found himself at an inflection point. He was starting to give up hope of collecting millions of dollars owed to him by a Russian-aligned Ukrainian political party, and was straining to help his son-in-law salvage bad real estate investments. And he was also itching for one last shot on the American political stage. Over coffee at the Montage Beverly Hills hotel with an old friend, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., Mr. Manafort pursued an opportunity that he thought could solve his problems — joining Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. And Mr. Barrack, one of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, agreed to help make that happen. By the end of March, Mr. Manafort was on board, and in May, he was promoted to campaign chairman and chief strategist. Under Mr. Manafort’s direction, Mr. Trump secured the nomination, rallied much of the Republican Party establishment behind him and set the strategy that would take him to the White House. But instead of being a crowning achievement, the job that Mr. Manafort thought would turbocharge his consulting business set the stage for his downfall. Although Mr. Manafort was forced out of the Trump campaign less than three months before Election Day, his suddenly high profile set off increased scrutiny of his foreign consulting work by congressional and law enforcement investigators. The investigations have left Mr. Manafort, 68, owing millions of dollars to his lawyers, according to people familiar with his defense, and led some friends and business partners to distance themselves from him. And on Monday, the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, charged Mr. Manafort and his longtime deputy, Rick Gates, with violating lobbying, tax and banking laws in an effort to hide more than $75 million in income from their work in Ukrainian politics. The charges stem from work performed by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates from at least 2006 to 2015 for Russia-aligned Ukrainian politicians and parties, including the one led by the former Ukrainian president Viktor F. Yanukovych. \"He could have kept running campaigns for the Yanukovychs of the world, and nobody would have cared,\" said Hector T. Hoyos, one of Mr. Manafort’s closest friends and business partners. \"But he took on the Trump campaign because he believed that the country was going down the wrong path, and he wanted to make a difference,\" Mr. Hoyos said of Mr. Manafort, who is the godfather of Mr. Hoyos’s daughter. Had things not gone south, Mr. Hoyos said, \"it would have been a huge business windfall for Paul.\" \"When you’re a kingmaker,\" he said, \"everyone wants to get close to you. That wasn’t the main reason that he got involved and decided to run the campaign, but that was in the back of his mind.\" Nonetheless, Mr. Manafort \"is not regretful of joining the Trump campaign,\" said Mr. Hoyos, who spoke with his friend on Saturday. \"He is regretful of doing the work he did in Ukraine.\" Mr. Manafort first made his name in politics as a swashbuckling young Republican operative on the presidential campaigns of Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan. But his work outside of electoral politics is where he really made his mark — and his fortune. He and two young colleagues from Mr. Reagan’s campaigns — Charles R. Black Jr. and Roger J. Stone Jr. — formed the core of a new breed of consulting and lobbying outfit that parlayed campaign-forged connections into big contracts from American businesses and foreign interests seeking to curry favor with the Reagan administration. In this shadowy world of international political consulting, Mr. Manafort, Mr. Gates and other Americans have earned vast sums working for clients tainted by corruption or authoritarianism or whose interests sometimes do not align with those of the United States, including Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Mobutu Sese Seko of the Democratic Republic of Congo. For much of the last decade, Mr. Manafort’s work focused on Ukraine. He is credited with resurrecting the career of Mr. Yanukovych, and selling him to the West as a pragmatic leader who could bring the country into the European Union. But Mr. Yanukovych’s government crumbled in 2014 when he fled to Russia after his security forces clamped down violently on street protests over his government’s corruption and pivot toward Moscow. Even after Mr. Yanukovych fled, Mr. Manafort continued consulting for a Russia-friendly party called Opposition Bloc, which emerged from the ashes of Mr. Yanukovych’s government. Around the same time, Mr. Manafort began taking out loans on properties that Monday’s indictment alleges were purchased using money laundered through overseas accounts from his Ukraine work. He appears to have used at least some of the money to try to salvage real estate investments spearheaded by his son-in-law Jeffrey Yohai. \"Paul had used the bulk of his cash to bail out the situation that his son-in-law created, so he had to borrow a lot against his properties,\" Mr. Hoyos said. Nonetheless, Mr. Manafort seemed eager to return to the bright glare of the American political spotlight — even if it meant working for Mr. Trump for free, as he promised Mr. Trump in a memo delivered to the candidate’s family by Mr. Barrack. In the memo pitching his services to Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort cited as selling points the fact that he owned an apartment in Trump Tower in Manhattan, where the campaign was headquartered, and his lobbying firm’s work for Mr. Trump in the 1990s, when it pushed to change the flight path of planes flying over Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. And Mr. Manafort cast his international work as a strength, while spinning his two-decade absence from American politics as proof that he would \"not bring any Washington baggage\" to a campaign that was channeling anti-establishment fervor. Mr. Trump and Mr. Manafort quickly developed a rapport on the campaign trail. Mr. Trump and his family came to view the veteran operative as a valuable resource on a wide range of subjects on a campaign that had been run to that point by younger, less experienced operatives. For his part, Mr. Manafort relished being back in the white-hot center of American politics, according to his associates. But it was not long before he was engaged in a bitter power struggle with Mr. Trump’s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Within a month of Mr. Manafort’s arrival, Mr. Trump elevated him above Mr. Lewandowski, who was later fired, giving Mr. Manafort authority to hire his own team and increase the notoriously frugal campaign’s spending on advertising and field organizing. Mr. Manafort brought on a number of his former associates in senior roles. Some — such as Mr. Gates, the operative Michael Caputo and the pollster Tony Fabrizio — also had experience working in Ukraine or other former Soviet states, and have since drawn scrutiny from the news media or from congressional and law enforcement investigators examining Russia connections. But things quickly went south for Mr. Manafort when news outlets began investigating his work and associations in Ukraine. When The New York Times published an exposé revealing that a ledger from Mr. Yanukovych’s party listed $12.7 million in off-books cash payments earmarked for Mr. Manafort’s company, Mr. Manafort argued to others in campaign leadership that the story was ginned up by allies of Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, and would blow over. Some campaign officials wanted to keep Mr. Manafort on board, but Stephen K. Bannon, who had recently been brought on as the campaign’s chief executive officer, told Mr. Manafort \"this is bad,\" and told Mr. Trump \"that guy has to go.\" Within days of the article — as well as contemporaneous exposés by other news outlets on Mr. Manafort’s activities and associates in Ukraine — Mr. Manafort was forced off the campaign. Mr. Manafort continued talking strategy with top campaign officials through Election Day, though, according to campaign officials. And, in the days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, he called Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to repudiate a dossier of memos written by a former British intelligence officer that mentioned him. The dossier alleged that Mr. Manafort managed \"a well-developed conspiracy of cooperation\" between the Trump campaign \"and the Russian leadership,\" and that Mr. Yanukovych had informed President Vladimir V. Putin that he ordered \"substantial kickback payments\" to Mr. Manafort. Those claims were \"garbage,\" Mr. Manafort told Mr. Priebus, according to someone familiar with the call. Yet even as the investigations of his activities heated up, Mr. Manafort continued to solicit international business. In recent months, associates say, he traveled to Ecuador; Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates; and Iraqi Kurdistan, among other places, and did little to discourage the perception that clients and potential clients could stand to benefit from his connections to Mr. Trump. Some clients, such as the allies of the leader of Iraq’s Kurdish region who hired Mr. Manafort to help administer and promote a referendum on Kurdish independence from Iraq, were not dissuaded by the investigations and his sudden notoriety. But after it was revealed that Mr. Mueller’s agents had executed a pre-dawn raid on Mr. Manafort’s home in July in Alexandria, Va., he became toxic to prospective business partners, according to Mr. Hoyos. \"People were hesitant to be exposed to the fallout that was happening around Paul,\" Mr. Hoyos said. \"They didn’t want that to tarnish their image in the United States and around the world.\" Mr. Hoyos said he had brought Mr. Manafort into a number of business ventures, including with a Chinese construction billionaire and a Chinese government-owned investment fund, but he informed Mr. Manafort in recent weeks that he needed to end their business relationship. \"He was really, really sad, but he understood,\" Mr. Hoyos said. \"He apologized to me, and said, ‘I’m sorry that I created all these problems for you.’\" The last months have also strained Mr. Manafort’s family. His older daughter has filed divorce from Mr. Yohai, while his younger daughter was questioned by a potential employer about whether the payments from Ukraine could be traced back to her, though she ultimately was hired. Mr. Hoyos said that Mr. Manafort’s daughters and their mother, Kathleen Manafort, who has been married to Mr. Manafort for nearly 40 years, are rallying behind him. \"They want their father to be around when their kids grow up,\" Mr. Hoyos said, \"and that is very much in doubt.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/paul-manafort.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Under Mueller Scrutiny, Democratic Donor Tony Podesta Resigns From Lobbying Firm', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — Tony Podesta, a prominent lobbyist and Democratic donor who has come under scrutiny from the escalating special counsel investigation, stepped down on Monday from the firm he co-founded, according to people familiar with the firm. The firm, the Podesta Group, has lost clients as it has been increasingly drawn into the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. On Monday, the Podesta Group and another company with which it had worked, Mercury Public Affairs, were referenced — though not by name — in an indictment of two former Trump campaign officials, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. No charges have been brought against Mr. Podesta or officials from the Podesta Group or Mercury. But both firms have been subpoenaed for records and testimony about their work on behalf of a client referred to them in 2012 by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates, the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, a nonprofit group based in Brussels. The work for the European Center, which ended in 2014, was cited in the indictment on Monday as part of a \"scheme\" by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to gain support in Washington for their longtime client, the pro-Russian leader Viktor F. Yanukovych, a former president of Ukraine, while evading disclosure requirements for foreign lobbying. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates were charged with violating tax, banking and foreign lobbying laws in an effort to hide more than $75 million in income from their work in Ukrainian politics. The indictment was the subject of intense interest on K Street, where the Justice Department’s enforcement of the foreign lobbying requirements under the Foreign Agents Registration Act is widely seen as toothless. The charges against Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates that are related to the act, coming as powerful members of Congress are demanding more enforcement of the law, were seen by some as a shot across the bow of Washington lobbyists. Mr. Podesta announced his departure at a staff meeting on Monday. He is the brother of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman John Podesta, who co-founded the firm. Tony Podesta has become the target of attacks from conservatives looking to shift attention away from Mr. Mueller’s scrutiny of President Trump’s campaign team. A person familiar with Mr. Podesta’s remarks at Monday’s staff meeting said he cited attacks from Fox News and the conservative media as making it \"impossible to run a public affairs shop.\" That person was not authorized to publicly discuss the internal meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. A partner at the firm, who also did not want to be identified discussing delicate internal affairs, said that even before Mr. Podesta announced his departure, some senior partners were trying to convince clients to remain with them as they worked to reintroduce the company with branding that would not include Mr. Podesta’s name.  The partner added that the effort had been fueled partly by Mr. Podesta’s aggressive efforts to defend himself against coverage by the conservative news media on the special counsel’s scrutiny of the Podesta Group. The firm has been among Washington’s highest grossing lobbying shops for years. Mr. Podesta’s resignation was first reported by Politico on Monday afternoon. Mr. Podesta’s lawyer on Monday sent a cease-and-desist letter to a Fox News host over his  claims on air that Mr. Podesta and his brother, John Podesta, worked closely with Mr. Manafort on behalf of Russia. The host, Tucker Carlson, said that the Podesta brothers and Mr. Manafort were the \"central figures\" in Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Mr. Podesta’s lawyer, Geoffrey R. Garinther, wrote to Mr. Carlson on Monday that his \"false and defamatory statements have caused damage and injury to the reputation of Mr. Podesta and the Podesta Group.\" The indictment on Monday did not name the Podesta Group or Mercury, instead referring to them as \"two Washington, D.C., firms\" that were recruited by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates \"to lobby in the United States on behalf of Yanukovych, the Party of Regions, and the government of Ukraine.\" Mr. Podesta and a spokesman for his firm did not respond to requests for comment. Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury, said in a statement that the firm \"takes its obligations to follow all laws, rules and regulations very seriously\" and \"has and will continue to fully cooperate with the Office of the Special Counsel in its investigation.\" The companies were paid more than $1.1 million each, according to lobbying filings, to try to rally support among American policymakers and opinion leaders for Mr. Yanukovych, and to quell concerns about his leadership and his government’s jailing of a political rival. Neither firm initially registered with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires firms that lobby or conduct public relations for foreign individuals, companies, governments and political parties to reveal detailed information about their work. The Podesta Group and Mercury said they relied on assurances provided by the nonprofit group that it was neither funded nor controlled by any foreign government or party. But both firms were compelled this year to belatedly — and, in the case of Mercury, begrudgingly — register under the act, after their activities came under scrutiny from the Justice Department. In his statement, Mr. McKeon said Mercury followed the advice of legal counsel in its disclosure of its relationship with the European Center and noted that it registered the relationship under less detailed congressional lobbying disclosure rules. The Podesta Group also reported its relationship with the European Center under those disclosure rules.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/tony-podesta-resignation-lobbying.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Rick Gates, a Protégé of Paul Manafort, Is Indicted Alongside Him', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — Rick Gates followed Paul Manafort to Eastern Europe, Africa, the Trump presidential campaign, and now a federal building where he surrendered on Monday to the F.B.I. Mr. Gates, 45, is a former business associate of Mr. Manafort, the ousted chairman of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign who also turned himself in to the F.B.I. on Monday. The men are charged with money laundering and violations of tax and foreign lobbying laws. They are the first to be charged in a special counsel investigation that has dogged Mr. Trump’s first year in office. Mr. Manafort has been charged with laundering more than $18 million to buy properties and services. Mr. Gates has been accused of transferring more than $3 million from offshore accounts. Both men are charged with making false statements. The indictments are the first in the long-running investigation of Mr. Trump’s associates and possible ties to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump has railed against the special counsel investigation. On Monday morning, Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post that the charges had nothing to do with the Trump campaign, adding \"there is NO COLLUSION!\" Separately, an early foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty on Monday to lying to the F.B.I. about a contact with a Russian professor with ties to Kremlin officials, prosecutors said. A protégé of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Gates survived the Manafort exodus from the campaign and went on to have a central role in Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee and a lobbying group that was formed to advance the president’s agenda. Mr. Gates was forced out of that group in April amid questions about Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. \"As part of the scheme, Manafort and Gates repeatedly provided false information to financial bookkeepers, tax accountants and legal counsel, among others,\" the indictment said. Attempts to reach Mr. Gates on Monday were unsuccessful. If convicted of money laundering, the most serious charge, Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort could face up to 20 years in prison. Mr. Manafort had been under federal investigation on suspicion of violating tax law, laundering money and whether he appropriately disclosed his foreign lobbying work. As Mr. Manafort’s business associate, Mr. Gates’s name is listed on documents that are linked to companies Mr. Manafort’s firm established in Cyprus for payments from politicians and businesspeople in Eastern Europe, according to records reviewed by The New York Times. When the business partners worked in Ukraine, Mr. Gates flew to Moscow for meetings with associates of a Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska. Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort met years ago when Mr. Gates was interning at Mr. Manafort’s Washington consulting firm, Black, Manafort, Stone, Kelly. The firm was known for running Republican political campaigns and then lobbying the politicians after they won their elections. In Washington, Mr. Manafort was known for representing dictators and strongmen, such as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines. Mr. Manafort also represented the Trump Organization to lobby the Treasury Department regarding casino transaction rules. Mr. Gates would later follow Mr. Manafort to a new firm, Davis Manafort, which worked on the campaign of Viktor F. Yanukovych, the pro-Russia former Ukranian president. This work connected the men with Mr. Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Deripaska has been denied a visa to travel to the United States because of allegations that he is linked to organized crime operations, charges Mr. Deripaska has denied. In 2008, Mr. Gates took over the firm’s duties in Eastern Europe, where he worked on business development and contract negotiations. And this work could be lucrative. Mr. Manafort was a multimillionaire with vacation homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and the Hamptons. In 2007, Mr. Gates and his wife sold their home in Richmond, Va., for $700,000 and took out a $1.5 million loan for a house in one of the city’s wealthier neighborhoods, according to public records. That same year Davis Manafort embarked on a new venture — a private equity fund created to buy small companies in Russia and Eastern Europe. Mr. Deripaska was the biggest investor in the fund, called Pericles. Mr. Gates has said he read news reports about Mr. Deripaska and his visa problems, but they did not raise concerns for him. \"We thought we had a good business model,\" Mr. Gates has said. \"We thought we were going to be successful.\" The fund floundered and the one deal with Mr. Deripaska turned into a legal dispute. The fund also raised red flags for investigators, particularly the transactions that flowed through offshore accounts in Cyprus. According to handwritten ledgers found in a former office of Mr. Yanukovych’s political party, payments totaling $12.7 million were made to Mr. Manafort in undisclosed cash transactions between 2007 and 2012. Other documents suggest that one payment that was earmarked for Mr. Manafort was paid through an offshore bank account. Mr. Manafort has said that the ledgers are forgeries and that he never received secret cash payments. Davis Manafort used shell companies to process payments for its political and business activities. Mr. Gates was one of the employees who worked with the Cypriot law firm that registered these companies, according to documents reviewed by The Times. Russian oligarchs and businesses have been using Cyprus as a tax haven for years. Mr. Gates has said he was told that the firm’s clients instructed Davis Manafort to use accounts in Cyprus for money transfers. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, said Mr. Gates used money from some of these offshore bank accounts to pay for his mortgage, the tuition for his children’s education and decorating his home. According to public records, Mr. Gates lives in Richmond. In early 2014, Mr. Yanukovych was ousted from power, sending Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates to look for new political clients. The client search ultimately led them to the Republican presidential primary race in the United States. Mr. Gates followed Mr. Manafort to the Trump campaign in the spring of 2016. Mr. Gates managed many of the campaign’s daily operations and often traveled with Mr. Trump and others working on the campaign. After the election, Mr. Gates went on to help run Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee and later a lobbying group that raised money to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda. But federal investigators remained interested in the work Mr. Gates did with Mr. Manafort. Mr. Mueller said that the men made tens of millions of dollars as a result of their work in Ukraine and that they worked to hide the payments for about a decade. The two men \"laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts,\" the indictment read.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/rick-gates-russia.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'George Papadopoulos, First to Plead Guilty in Russia Inquiry', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — A young foreign policy consultant whom President Trump once praised as an \"excellent guy\" is the first aide in the Trump campaign to plead guilty in the special counsel’s investigation into ties between the president’s associates and the Russian government. Mr. Trump — asked by The Washington Post in March 2016 about his foreign policy team — said of the consultant, George Papadopoulos: \"He’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy.\" Earlier that month, Mr. Papadopoulos, 30, first communicated with a professor in London with links to the Russian government, according to court documents unsealed Monday. The professor was later identified as Joseph Mifsud, according to a Senate aide familiar with the case. The relationship between Mr. Papadopoulos and Professor Mifsud would lead Mr. Papadopoulos to two other people with ties to the Russian government and to attempts to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, the documents said. In April, the professor told Mr. Papadopoulos that the Russians had \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in \"thousands of emails.\" Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty this month to lying to the F.B.I. about that conversation when he was first interviewed in January. At the time, he told agents that Professor Mifsud was \"a nothing.\" But Mr. Papadopoulos now acknowledges that he knew the professor had \"substantial connections to Russian government officials.\" The plea offers the most specific evidence connecting the Trump campaign to the Russian government’s interference in the 2016 presidential election — allegations that the White House again denied on Monday. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, played down Mr. Papadopoulos’s role as \"a volunteer member of an advisory council that literally met one time.\" After he was interviewed by the F.B.I. a second time, Mr. Papadopoulos changed his phone number and deleted a Facebook account that he used to communicate with Russian officials, according to the court documents. Attempts to reach Mr. Papadopoulos, who is based in Chicago, and his relatives in that area were unsuccessful on Monday. Robert W. Stanley, one of Mr. Papadopoulos’s lawyers, declined to comment and would not say where his client was. Mr. Papadopoulos was arrested in July when he arrived at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. Mr. Papadopoulos joined the Trump campaign in March 2016, according to his LinkedIn profile, while he was at a consulting firm in London that specialized in energy and natural resources. He previously worked on Ben Carson’s Republican primary campaign from November 2015 until February 2016. Mr. Papadopoulos pitched himself to Mr. Carson’s team as a foreign policy expert who could raise a substantial amount of money for the candidate from the Greek-American community, according to a Republican official familiar with the interaction. Mr. Papadopoulos listed Kenneth Weinstein, the chief executive of the Hudson Institute, where he had worked on a contract basis, as a reference. The Carson campaign offered him a paid position on the national security and foreign policy advisory committee, and he promised to move to Northern Virginia, where the campaign was based, but he relocated to Chicago instead to be closer to his girlfriend, the official said. Later, after the Carson campaign began to unravel, Mr. Papadopoulos reached out to several of Mr. Trump’s associates, including the policy director Sam Clovis, who was eager to assemble a foreign policy advisory council after dozens of military and diplomatic officials signed a letter describing Mr. Trump as unfit to serve as president. Mr. Trump was widely criticized for having an inexperienced team of foreign policy advisers. A former Trump campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Papadopoulos was \"almost fired\" after the young aide, without the approval of senior officials, told British news media that Prime Minister David Cameron should apologize for calling Mr. Trump’s remarks on barring Muslims from the United States \"divisive, stupid and wrong.\" By fall 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos had fallen out of favor. In an email to one of Mr. Trump’s top advisers, Mr. Papadopoulos asked plaintively if he was being shut out for \"giving an interview I wasn’t supposed to give,\" according to an aide who was given a copy of the message. No answer was given, the person said. Then, a week before the campaign, he reached out to top advisers to discuss an event he hoped to schedule with a congressman he described as a close friend, Gus Bilirakis, Republican of Florida. He did not receive a reply. School district officials in Skokie, Ill., near Chicago, said Mr. Papadopoulos graduated in 2005 from Niles West High School. As an undergraduate at DePaul University in Chicago, he studied political science, a university spokeswoman said. He later attended the University College of London, according to his LinkedIn profile. In college, he served as an analyst for the American Hellenic Institute, a lobbying group and research institute, and worked for the Hudson Institute, a conservative organization in Washington, initially as an unpaid intern, a spokeswoman said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/george-papadopoulos-russia-trump.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Investigations of Manafort in New York Are Beyond Trump’s Power to Pardon', 'text': ' In July, President Trump wrote on Twitter that \"all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon.\" But for Paul J. Manafort, who surrendered to the F.B.I. on Monday after being indicted on federal criminal charges, Mr. Trump’s power has a limitation of potential significance: a presidential pardon does not apply to charges from state and local authorities. Although it is not known whether Mr. Manafort will receive or even request a presidential pardon, he also faces scrutiny from authorities in New York whose prosecutions would not be subject to one. Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, and Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York state attorney general, have been pursuing their own investigations into Mr. Manafort, a former campaign chairman to Mr. Trump. Although those investigations are unfolding separately from the federal case that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, filed against Mr. Manafort, the New York authorities are examining some of the same activity highlighted in the federal indictment, underscoring the relevance of their exemption from a potential pardon. The two New York prosecutors, both Democrats, have issued subpoenas and sought financial records about Mr. Manafort’s real estate and business activities in New York, according to three people briefed on the investigations who were not authorized to discuss law enforcement matters that were continuing. Possible violations being pursued by Mr. Vance could carry prison sentences of up to four years for Mr. Manafort, who has denied any wrongdoing. Neither of the prosecutors has determined whether any state charges are warranted, and if they did, those cases would most likely advance only in the event of a presidential pardon. Asked about the possibility of a pardon for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Trump, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said: \"I haven’t had any conversations with him about that. I think we should let the process play through before we start looking at those steps.\" The New York investigations focus in part on Mr. Manafort’s relationship with the Federal Savings Bank of Chicago, a small lender that provided him some big loans. The bank, which received a subpoena but is not itself under investigation, is led by Stephen M. Calk, a onetime economic adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Vance’s office is questioning whether Mr. Manafort misled the bank when applying for the loans, the people briefed on the investigation said, a previously unreported development that hews closely to the federal indictment announced on Monday. In examining the loan documents, Mr. Vance’s office is seeking to determine whether Mr. Manafort used the loan money for an unauthorized purpose, which could amount to filing a false business record, a crime in New York State. The New York prosecutors are also seeking to trace cash that Mr. Manafort moved in and out of American bank accounts, partly to verify whether he paid state taxes on income earned overseas, the people said. Investigators working for the New York prosecutors have obtained documents suggesting that at least some of the money came from a bank in Cyprus, the Mediterranean nation considered a tax haven and a magnet for Russian money. This is another area of inquiry that overlaps with Mr. Mueller’s case, a 12-count indictment that accused Mr. Manafort and a business partner of conspiracy to launder money from accounts in Cyprus and elsewhere. The overlap will most likely mean that Mr. Mueller’s case will take priority over Mr. Vance’s and Mr. Schneiderman’s. And while Mr. Vance’s office is continuing to investigate Mr. Manafort, Mr. Schneiderman has deferred his inquiry into the former Trump campaign chairman, at least temporarily, so as to not interfere with the federal case, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. Mr. Schneiderman would most likely resume his investigation if Mr. Manafort received a presidential pardon, the person said. This year, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported the existence of Mr. Vance’s investigation and his subpoena of the Chicago bank, while The New York Times and others have reported Mr. Manafort’s extensive financial ties to Cyprus and Mr. Calk’s relationship with the Trump campaign. The status of Mr. Schneiderman’s investigation, and the focus of Mr. Vance’s, were not previously known. A spokeswoman for Mr. Vance declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman. Mr. Schneiderman has clashed with Mr. Trump or his associates on a number of occasions. He sued the Trump administration to preserve an Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation, and he sued Trump University, contending that it used high-pressure sales tactics and false claims to woo students. Mr. Trump settled the case after winning the election. Mr. Trump has called Mr. Schneiderman a \"lightweight,\" but Mr. Schneiderman has denied that politics play any role in his investigations. \"I think we’ve got an extraordinary record of having gone after many, many Democrats since I’ve been in office,\" he said in an interview with MSNBC in September. Prosecutors were not the first to call attention to Mr. Manafort’s New York real estate dealings. Those transactions came to light on a blog, 377union.com, written by two New York lawyers who used public mortgage documents to piece together Mr. Manafort’s real estate transactions, some of which now appear in the federal charges against Mr. Manafort. Over the last several years, the blog noted, limited liability companies linked to Mr. Manafort bought residential properties using cash, only to later take out big loans using the properties as part of the collateral. Initially, the loans came from big banks, but by late 2016, Mr. Manafort turned to the Federal Savings Bank in Chicago. In November, the Chicago bank provided a $9.5 million loan to Summerbreeze L.L.C., a shell company tied to Mr. Manafort, using a home in the Hamptons as collateral, The Times previously reported. Two months later, the bank provided another two mortgages, totaling about $6.5 million, for a brownstone that Mr. Manafort owns in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn. These were no small loans for Federal Savings, which typically focuses on affordable mortgages for military veterans. Mr. Manafort’s loans amounted to about 5.4 percent of the bank’s total assets, according to public reports. Publicly filed documents classified the Brooklyn mortgages as a \"building loan\" and a \"project loan,\" the type of mortgages that owners generally can use to upgrade their properties. Mr. Vance’s office is questioning whether Mr. Manafort actually used the money for repairs to the Brooklyn property, or if he misrepresented the purpose of the loans and instead spent it on repaying other debts, the people briefed on the investigation said. The loans from the Chicago bank arrived when Mr. Manafort was digging out from foreclosure proceedings that another lender, Genesis Capital, filed on the Brooklyn property, court records show. One of the loans from the Chicago bank was for $5.3 million, the same amount of money that Genesis pledged to lend before filing for foreclosure. Mr. Manafort has also indicated that he was taking out loans at that time to salvage property investments he made in California with his son-in-law, Jeffrey Yohai, whose real estate business filed for bankruptcy. In an affidavit filed in the bankruptcy case, Mr. Manafort said he had decided to \"assist with additional funding to protect my existing investments.\" It is unclear whether Mr. Manafort used some of the loan money from the Chicago bank for that purpose. Mr. Yohai’s investment activities are separately under investigation by Mr. Schneiderman’s office. In questioning whether Mr. Manafort misled his lenders, the New York authorities are stepping into an area of focus for Mr. Mueller. Mr. Manafort, the federal indictment said, bought multimillion-dollar properties in the United States, and then borrowed millions more against the homes, \"thereby obtaining cash in the United States without reporting and paying taxes on the income.\" The indictment added that \"in order to increase the amount of money he could access in the United States,\" Mr. Manafort \"defrauded the institutions that loaned money.\" The indictment did not specify the lenders; however, it refers to a loan on the Brooklyn property that matches the time in early 2016 — and dollar amount — of the loan that Genesis Capital provided Mr. Manafort. The indictment notes that \"after promising the bank\" that part of the money \"would be used solely for construction,\" Mr. Manafort instead diverted some of it to making a down payment on another property in California. Like Mr. Mueller, Mr. Vance and Mr. Schneiderman also examined the flow of money in and out of Mr. Manafort’s bank accounts in the United States — and so far, they have traced some of that cash to accounts in Cyprus, the people briefed on the investigations said. It is unclear whether he paid New York State taxes on that income. Mr. Mueller’s charges outline a similar scheme involving Cyprus accounts, alleging that all of the money that Mr. Manafort used to originally buy the Brooklyn property came from an entity in Cyprus. Mr. Manafort, the indictment also said, \"funneled millions of dollars in payments\" that he had earned from Ukranian clients into companies and bank accounts based in foreign countries such as Cyprus. Mr. Manafort then \"used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States, without paying taxes on that income.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/business/trump-manafort-pardon-new-york-state-vance.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Supreme Court Delves Into Semantics of English in a Capital Case', 'text': ' A Supreme Court argument about making sure that death row inmates have adequate resources to challenge their sentences took a semantic turn on Monday, with the justices trying to make sense of the differences between two similar phrases. On the one hand, a federal law says that death row inmates are entitled to money for investigators and experts if judges find it \"reasonably necessary\" for their defense. On the other hand, the federal appeals court in New Orleans, which oversees cases from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, says there must a \"substantial need\" for the money. The appeals court denied funds to a Texas inmate, Carlos Manuel Ayestas. He challenged the denial, saying the court had set the bar too high. But Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the two phrases meant the same thing. \"What is the difference between ‘reasonably necessary’ and ‘substantial need’?\" he asked. \"I have been racking my brain trying to think of something that it is reasonably necessary for me to obtain but as to which I do not have the substantial need. And I can’t think of an example.\" Several of the court’s more liberal justices disagreed, saying that \"reasonably necessary\" connoted matters that a reasonable lawyer with finite resources would try to pursue. The caveat about \"finite resources,\" Justice Elena Kagan explained, was \"just to make sure that, like a reasonable attorney for Bill Gates, would scour the earth and not care about it.\" Justice Alito responded that lawyers in capital cases might want to pursue many things. \"A reasonable attorney with finite means might devote those finite means to an avenue of investigation that has very, very little chance of success because there is so much at stake,\" he said. \"So I don’t understand how that can be the test here, where the statutory language is ‘reasonably necessary.’\" Mr. Ayestas was convicted of murdering Santiaga Paneque, 67, after invading her home in Houston. There was little doubt about his guilt, but his trial lawyers may have had some hope of persuading the jury to spare his life. \"This is a horrendous murder,\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said. \"The only chance in the world that this defendant has is if he can put on a mitigation case and convince one juror he shouldn’t get the death penalty. There is nothing else.\" But Lee Kovarsky, a lawyer for Mr. Ayestas, said his trial lawyers had done almost nothing to develop a mitigation case notwithstanding indications that he had serious mental health problems. The defense presentation concerning mitigating factors at the sentencing phase \"lasted two minutes,\" Mr. Kovarsky said. Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Scott A. Keller, the solicitor general of Texas, whether Mr. Ayestas’s trial lawyers had done an adequate job. \"How can you stand here and say that this kind of investigation meets any constitutional standard?\" she asked. Mr. Keller said the trial lawyers had done some work, notably by trying to contact Mr. Ayestas’s family in Honduras. Justice Ginsburg said that was not enough. \"There are many, many sources other than asking family members if you’re looking into mental health,\" she said. \"There’s school records. There’s criminal justice records.\" Justice Stephen G. Breyer said there was an easy way to dispose of the case, by instructing the appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to use the \"reasonably necessary\" standard, the phrase in the federal law. \"End of case,\" Justice Breyer said. \"This circuit, you are to follow the statute. And that’s it.

Banks, the militant Chippewa who founded the American Indian Movement in 1968 and led often-violent insurrections to protest the treatment of Native Americans and the nation’s history of injustices against its indigenous peoples, died on Sunday night at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He was 80. His daughter Tashina Banks Rama said the cause was complications of pneumonia following successful open-heart surgery a week ago at the clinic. Mr. Banks lived on the Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota, where he was born and where he grew up. Mr. Banks and his Oglala Sioux compatriot Russell Means were by the mid-1970s perhaps the nation’s best-known Native Americans since Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, who led the attack that crushed the cavalry forces of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Montana Territory in 1876. Mr. Banks, whose early life of poverty, alcoholism and alienation mirrored the fates of countless ancestors, led protests that caused mass disorder, shootouts, deaths and grievous injuries. He was jailed for burglary and convicted of riot and assault, and he became a fugitive for nine years. He found sanctuary in California and New York but finally gave up and was imprisoned for 14 months. He once led a six-day takeover of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, and mounted an armed 71-day occupation of the town of Wounded Knee, S.D., on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Wounded Knee was the scene of the last major conflict of the American Indian Wars, in which 350 Lakota men, women and children were massacred by United States troops in 1890. While his protests won some government concessions and drew national attention and wide sympathy for the deplorable social and economic conditions of American Indians, Mr. Banks achieved few real improvements in the daily lives of millions of Native Americans, who live on reservations and in major cities and lag behind most fellow citizens in jobs, housing and education. To admirers, Mr. Banks was a broad-chested champion of native pride. With dark, piercing eyes, high cheekbones, a jutting chin and long raven hair, he was a paladin who defied authority and, in an era crowded with civil rights protests, spoke for the nation’s oldest minority. To his critics, including many American Indians, Mr. Banks was a self-promoter, grabbing headlines and becoming a darling of politically liberal Hollywood stars like Jane Fonda and Marlon Brando. His severest detractors, including law-enforcement officials, said he let followers risk injury and arrest while he jumped bail to avoid a long prison sentence and did not surrender for nearly a decade. Mr. Banks and Mr. Means first won national attention for declaring a \"Day of Mourning\" for Native Americans on Thanksgiving Day in 1970. Their band seized the ship Mayflower II, a replica of the original in Plymouth, Mass., and a televised confrontation between real Indians and costumed \"Pilgrims\" made the American Indian Movement leaders overnight heroes. In 1972, the two organized cross-country car caravans on \"Trails of Broken Treaties.\" They converged on Washington with 500 followers to protest Indian living standards and lost treaty rights, occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs and held out for nearly a week, destroying documents and the premises, until the government agreed to discuss Indian grievances and review treaty commitments. In 1973, after a white man killed an Indian in a saloon brawl and was charged not with murder but with involuntary manslaughter, Mr. Banks led 200 American Indian Movement protesters in a face-off with the police in Custer, S.D. It became a riot when the slain man’s mother was beaten by officers. After he left town, Mr. Banks, who said he had merely tried to ease tensions, was charged with assault and rioting. It was the last straw. \"We had reached a point in history where we could not tolerate the abuse any longer, where mothers could not tolerate the mistreatment that goes on on the reservations any longer, where they could not see another Indian youngster die,\" he told the author Peter Matthiessen. Weeks later, the siege that made Mr. Banks and Mr. Means famous across America began when 200 Oglala Lakota and A.I.M. followers with rifles and shotguns occupied Wounded Knee. About 300 United States marshals, F.B.I. agents and other law-enforcement officials cordoned off the area with armored cars and heavy weapons, touching off a 10-week battle of nerves and gunfire. Amid wide news media coverage, the significance of the battlefield was not lost on many Americans. Dee Brown’s best-selling book \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West\" (1970) had recently explored the record of massacres and atrocities against Native Americans on the expanding frontier, undermining one of the nation’s fondest myths. Proclaiming a willingness to die for their cause, Mr. Banks and Mr. Means demanded the ouster of Richard Wilson, the elected leader of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council, whom they called a corrupt white man’s stooge. The government refused. Shootings punctuated the days of stalemate, leaving wounded on both sides. Two Indians were killed, and a federal agent was shot and paralyzed. When it was over, Mr. Banks and Mr. Means were charged with assault and conspiracy. After a federal trial, with the defense raising historic and current Indian grievances, a judge dismissed the case for prosecutorial misconduct, including illegal wiretaps and evidence that had been tampered with. By then, Mr. Banks was a pre-eminent spokesman for Native Americans. He mediated armed conflicts between Indians and the authorities in various states. But his own legal troubles were not over. Charged with riot and assault with a deadly weapon for his role in the 1973 melee in Custer, he was found guilty in 1975. Facing up to 15 years in prison, he jumped bail and fled to California. With 1.4 million signatures on a petition supporting Mr. Banks, Gov. Jerry Brown granted him asylum in 1976, rejecting extradition to South Dakota by saying his life might be in danger if he were sent back. Mr. Banks later became chancellor of Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University, a small two-year college for Indians in Davis, Calif. Deprived of California sanctuary when Governor Brown was succeeded by a Republican, George Deukmejian, in early 1983, Mr. Banks found a new refuge on an Onondaga reservation near Syracuse. Federal officials said he would be arrested only if he left the reservation. But in 1984, weary of his confined life, he returned to South Dakota voluntarily and was sentenced to three years in prison. Paroled in 1985 after serving only 14 months, he moved to the Pine Ridge Reservation to work as a drug addiction and alcoholism counselor. He also turned his life around, embracing sobriety, giving talks on public service and organizing cross-country events that he called Sacred Runs, which became popular among supporters of Native Americans in later years. \"We were the prophets, the messengers, the fire starters,\" Mr. Banks said in an autobiography, \"Ojibwa Warrior: Dennis Banks and the Rise of the American Indian Movement\" (2005, with Richard Erdoes). \"Wounded Knee awakened not only the conscience of all Native Americans, but also of white Americans nationwide.\" Dennis James Banks was born on the Leech Lake Reservation on April 12, 1937. He never knew his father. His mother abandoned him to his grandparents. When he was 5, he was taken from his family and sent to a series of government schools for Indians that systematically denigrated his Ojibwa (Chippewa) culture, language and identity. He ran away often, until, at 17, he returned to Leech Lake. Unable to find work, he joined the Air Force and was stationed in Japan, where he married a Japanese woman, had a child with her and went absent without leave. Arrested and returned to the United States, he never saw his wife or child again. After being discharged, he moved to Minneapolis, drifted into crime, was arrested in a burglary and went to jail for two and a half years. Released in 1968, he founded the American Indian Movement with an Ojibwa he had met in prison, Clyde Bellecourt, and others to fight the oppression and endemic poverty of Native Americans. He became chairman and national director as the group, based in Minneapolis, forged alliances and grew rapidly. After two years it said it had 25,000 members. Within a year A.I.M., with its flair for guerrilla tactics, joined a lengthy occupation of Alcatraz Island, the former federal prison site in San Francisco Bay. After his fugitive years, Mr. Banks had a modest movie career. He had roles in Franc Roddam’s \"War Party\" (1988), Michael Apted’s \"Thunderheart\" (1992), Michael Mann’s \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1992, with Russell Means), and Georgina Lightning’s \"Older Than America\" (2008), which explored the devastating effects of Indian boarding schools like those Mr. Banks had been forced to attend. Mr. Banks also appeared in documentaries: \"We Shall Remain, Part V: Wounded Knee\" (2009), a Ric Burns \"American Experience\" television film directed by Stanley Nelson; \"A Good Day to Die\" (2010), directed by David Mueller and Lynn Salt; and \"Nowa Cumig: The Drum Will Never Stop\" (2011), directed by Marie-Michele Jasmin-Belisle. Besides his wife and child in Japan, Mr. Banks had many children with other women. In addition to Ms. Banks Rama, he is survived by 19 children, 11 with the surname Banks: Janice, Darla, Deanna, Dennis, Red Elk, Tatanka, Minoh, Tokala, Tiopa, Tacanunpa and Arrow. The others are Glenda Roberts, Beverly Baribeau, Kevin Strong, D. J. Nelson-Banks, Bryan Graves, and Pearl, Denise and Kawlija Blanchard. Mr. Banks is also survived by more than 100 grandchildren, Ms. Banks Rama said. Mr. Banks was the 2016 vice presidential nominee of the California Peace and Freedom Party, which identified itself as socialist and feminist. The party’s presidential candidate was Gloria La Riva. As a single-state ticket, they won 66,000 votes. In recent years, Mr. Banks lived with some of his children in Kentucky and Minnesota. He was an honorary trustee of the Leech Lake Tribal College, a two-year public institution in Cass Lake, Minn. Mr. Means, who also appeared in movies and wrote a memoir, died on the Pine Ridge Reservation in 2012 at age 72. In 1990, both men joined a ceremony at the Pine Ridge Reservation commemorating the centenary of the Wounded Knee massacre. \"Maybe we opened up some eyes, opened some doors,\" Mr. Banks told The Los Angeles Times. \"And it was at least an educational process here. Fifteen years ago, there was no newspaper here, no radio station. Now there’s more community control over education.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/obituaries/dennis-banks-dead-american-indians.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Iona Opie, 94, Authority on Childish Things, Is Dead', 'text': ' Iona Opie, a British folklorist who worked with her husband, Peter, to produce major studies of nursery rhymes as well as the oral traditions of games, jokes, nicknames, taunts and pranks among schoolchildren, died on Oct. 23 in the town of Petersfield, in Hampshire, England. She was 94. Her death, in a nursing home, was confirmed by her son James. The Opies, inquisitive lovers of reference books who did not attend college, were nearly inseparable for almost 40 years. Their partnership began in Bedfordshire, where the publishing firm Mr. Opie had been working for was evacuated during World War II. He was bored. She was pregnant. They were looking for something to do together. While on a walk in the countryside, they came upon a ladybird (the species of beetle known in North America as a ladybug) and recited a nursery rhyme that begins: \"Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home / Your house is on fire / And your children all gone.\" They had known the rhyme as children but had not thought about it since. \"And the next time we were in London,\" Mrs. Opie said in a speech at the University of Sheffield in 1998, \"the first thing we did was go to the public library and ask for a book about the histories of nursery rhymes. And the book we were given was Halliwell’s `Nursery Rhymes of England,’ 1842.\" What they gleaned from James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps’s collection set the Opies on a seven-year hunt into the etymological and historical roots of nursery rhymes. In \"The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes\" (1951), they traced parts of \"Hey diddle diddle / The cat and the fiddle / The cow jumped over the moon\" to the 16th-century playwright Thomas Preston (\"They can play a new dance called hey-didle-didle\") and to a 1597 poem by Alexander Montgomerie (\"Of your own fidle take a spring / And dance when ye have done\"). And when they delved into the familiar short verse that begins \"Jack Sprat would eat no fat\" (which appeared in print as early as 1639), the Opies discovered that \"Jack Sprat\" was \"a term for a dwarf\" in the 16th and 17th centuries, and that the rhyme might have been used against \"a contemporary cleric of small proportions.\" Some of their collected rhymes were \"too rude and rumbustious,\" for their book, Mrs. Opie said, but they provided part of the foundation for their next big study. In \"The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren\" (1959), they surveyed 5,000 students in 70 schools throughout Britain and revealed that a type of secret childhood code of interaction is perpetuated through songs, rhymes, games, jeers and bullying. \"Like the savage,\" the Opies wrote of schoolchildren in that book, \"they are respecters, even venerators, of custom; and in their self-contained community, their basic lore and language seems scarcely to alter from generation to generation.\" Leonard Marcus, a children’s book historian and critic, said in a telephone interview that \"The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren\" \"captured on paper and showed the emotional complexity of children once they moved from family into the world of their peers.\" It also offered a glimpse, he said, into the tribal behavior of children that explained, in part, the cruelty exhibited by boys in William Golding’s 1954 novel, \"The Lord of the Flies.\"  Mrs. Opie did not stop observing children at play with that book. She and her husband continued to collaborate, and she continued their studies after his death in 1982. She traveled to British towns and villages, stopped at schoolyards that were enlivened by the shouts and screams of children, and asked the teachers to let her observe and talk to the students. \"And the head teachers were just so unalarmed in those days,\" Mrs. Opie said in her Sheffield speech, \"and usually they would say, ‘Well, come in, of course!’ And then, ‘Do you want to keep any of the children? Just help yourself!’\" For \"The People in the Playground\" (1993), Mrs. Opie watched children ages 7 to 11 and recorded their activities like a naturalist watching primate behavior in Tanzania. In a review in The Independent, Paul Barker wrote that Mrs. Opie \"speaks of the playground as a scene of Hobbesian conflict\" in which \"more or less everyone is playing something at which they are trying to win.\" Iona Margaret Balfour Archibald was born on Oct. 3, 1923, in Colchester, Essex. Her father, Robert Archibald, was director of the Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratory in Khartoum, Sudan. He was rarely at home. Her mother, the former Olive Cant, was a homemaker. Mrs. Opie attended the Sandecotes School in Parkstone, Dorset, and rather than go to college during the war as she had planned, she joined the Women’s Auxiliary Air Force and worked as a meteorologist. She met her future husband by writing him a fan letter about a book he had written. They married in 1943. \"I did this very stupid thing of letting myself get fascinated with Peter,\" her obituary in The Guardian quoted her as saying. She added, \"I was 19 and knew it was the end of my independent life.\" They pursued their work in austere fashion, but they amassed a huge collection of children’s playthings and books, 90 tons of which were moved from their former home in Alton to one they bought in West Liss in 1959, and where she continued to live. They worked in side-by-side offices. \"We led this curiously reclusive life,\" Mrs. Opie said at the University of Sheffield. \"We worked unsocial hours.\" They did not have a television. They did not go to pubs, restaurants, concerts or plays. They did not ask friends to join them for evenings at the house. \"We were expected to amuse ourselves,\" her son James said. But, he added, \"We fondly remember our day trips to the beach.\" James attended boarding school, as did his brother, Robert, and his sister, Letitia. This let their parents focus on their work. Besides James Opie, his siblings survive her, as do five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Well after her husband’s death, Mrs. Opie found a second collaborator in Maurice Sendak, the master of terrifying, haunting children’s books. In 1992, he illustrated a new edition of \"I Saw Esau: The Schoolchild’s Pocket Book,\" a collection of rhymes that the Opies had published 45 years earlier. \"Sendak’s works were very rooted in folklore,\" Mr. Marcus said, \"so he naturally would have turned to the Opies’ book for material and inspiration.\" Unsurprisingly, Mrs. Opie was an expert on Mother Goose, the prolific and unknown author of children’s rhymes and stories. In \"My Very First Mother Goose\" (1996), which was illustrated by Rosemary Wells, she named the reasons Mother Goose remained so appealing and her rhymes so enduring (calling them \"astonishing,\" \"golluptious\" \"pomsidilious\" and \"yo-heave-ho-ish\"). \"There they lie,\" she wrote, \"the nursery rhymes so much at the back of our minds that we can’t remember when we first learned them. What did they give us, so long ago? A suggestion that mishaps might be funny rather than tragic, that tantrums can be comical as well as frightening, and that laughter is the cure for practically everything.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/obituaries/iona-opie-dead-authority-on-childish-things.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'opinion': [{'title': 'Is the White House Scared Yet?', 'text': ' You know it’s a bad day for the White House when the president’s former campaign chairman is charged with money laundering, tax fraud, making false statements and failing to register as a foreign agent — and that is only the second most damaging story of the morning. Early Monday, Paul Manafort, who led Donald Trump’s campaign during several crucial months in 2016, and a longtime Manafort associate, Rick Gates, who was also a Trump campaign official, surrendered to federal authorities after being named in an indictment obtained by Robert Mueller III, who was appointed as special counsel in May to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. These are the sorts of people Mr. Trump has regularly chosen to associate with. And given Monday’s developments, they’re not the only ones who should be afraid of being ensnared in Mr. Mueller’s spreading net. Both men pleaded not guilty. The crimes they are charged with are very serious — money laundering alone carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison — but on their own they suggest no immediate link to the original subject of Mr. Mueller’s investigation: possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to help swing the election to Mr. Trump, and any subsequent cover-up of that collusion. Mr. Trump was eager to highlight that point, tweeting on Monday morning, \"there is NO COLLUSION!\" Surprise! Soon after Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates turned themselves in, newly unsealed court documents revealed that another Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations he had with a professor who had substantial ties to Russian government officials. The professor introduced Mr. Papadopoulos to a woman he claimed was a relative of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Then in April 2016 he told Mr. Papadopoulos that Moscow had \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails.\" Mr. Papadopoulos tried for several months to arrange a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Russians, including Mr. Putin. But in a late-January interview with F.B.I. investigators, Mr. Papadopoulos said that the professor had contacted him well before he joined the campaign and that the professor was \"a nothing\" who was \"B.S.’ing to be completely honest with you.\" Mr. Papadopoulos was not telling the truth, as it turned out. He had joined the Trump campaign as a foreign policy adviser in early March 2016, more than a month before speaking with the professor about the \"dirt\" on Mrs. Clinton. On July 27 of this year, he was arrested, and began cooperating with Mr. Mueller — a carrot-and-stick strategy that Mr. Mueller is most likely to keep using to try to turn other Trump associates. On Oct. 5 Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal officials. The guilty plea is the most direct evidence connecting the campaign to the Russian efforts to help elect Mr. Trump. After days of dishonesty, the White House acknowledged in July that Mr. Manafort and Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had attended a meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr. with Kremlin-connected intermediaries who said they had dirt on Mrs. Clinton. And the Trump adviser Roger Stone (recently kicked off Twitter for abusive and profane tweets) has acknowledged having contacts with WikiLeaks, which has been a conduit for Russian-hacked emails. And yet the White House’s response Monday was essentially \"George who?\" Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, called Mr. Papadopoulos a campaign \"volunteer\" who worked in an \"extremely limited\" role — a characterization that’s hard to square with the fact that Mr. Trump identified him, along with four other people, as a member of his foreign-policy team in March 2016. And then there were the numerous communications between Mr. Papadopoulos and top campaign officials about meeting with the Russians, including one encouraging Mr. Papadopoulos to \"make the trip\" to Moscow, \"if it is feasible.\" But back to Mr. Manafort. Mr. Trump tweeted Monday that the allegations in the indictment concern activities from \"years ago,\" before Mr. Manafort joined the campaign, and complained once again that the investigation was not focused on \"Crooked Hillary and the Dems.\" Putting aside Mr. Trump’s bizarre fixation with a political opponent he bested nearly a year ago, he’s wrong about the indictment, which explicitly alleges illegal behavior that continued through 2017. Anyway, whether Mr. Trump was aware of any of the specific details in the indictment is beside the point. He certainly must have known what he was getting in hiring Mr. Manafort. A Republican lobbyist and political consultant, Mr. Manafort has a long history of enriching himself working for some of the world’s most unscrupulous and dictatorial leaders, including Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, Jonas Savimbi in Angola and Mobutu Sese Seko of the Democratic Republic of Congo — not a list most American presidential candidates would want to be on. More recently, he helped to elect the pro-Kremlin Viktor Yanukovych as president of Ukraine. In 2014, Mr. Yanukovych fled the country for Russia in the face of street protests, opening the door for Mr. Putin to destabilize the country. The indictment charges that Mr. Manafort used overseas shell companies to launder more than $18 million of the tens of millions of dollars he raked in through his Ukraine work, and used that untaxed money to buy multimillion-dollar properties, luxury cars and fancy suits. Mr. Gates, a former protégé of Mr. Manafort’s, was charged with laundering more than $3 million. Both men were also accused of lying to bookkeepers, tax accountants and lawyers as part of their scheme. Mr. Manafort, in other words, embodies the sort of amoral, self-dealing denizen of the swamp that Mr. Trump pledged to drain when he got to Washington. What the president did not anticipate was that Mr. Mueller would be the one doing the draining.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/manafort-indictment-mueller-trump.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The Plot Against America', 'text': ' On Monday morning, after America learned that Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort’s lobbying partner, Rick Gates, had been indicted and turned themselves in to federal authorities, the president tried to distance himself from the unfolding scandal. \"Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign,\" the president wrote in one tweet. A few minutes later, he added, in another, \"Also, there is NO COLLUSION!\" At almost the exact same time, news broke suggesting that the F.B.I. has evidence of collusion. We learned that one of the Trump campaign’s foreign policy aides, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his attempts to solicit compromising information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Despite Trump’s hysterical denials and attempts at diversion, the question is no longer whether there was cooperation between Trump’s campaign and Russia, but how extensive it was. In truth, that’s been clear for a while. If it’s sometimes hard to grasp the Trump campaign’s conspiracy against our democracy, it’s due less to lack of proof than to the impudent improbability of its B-movie plotline. Monday’s indictments offer evidence of things that Washington already knows but pretends to forget. Trump, more gangster than entrepreneur, has long surrounded himself with bottom-feeding scum, and for all his nationalist bluster, his campaign was a vehicle for Russian subversion. We already knew that Manafort offered private briefings about the campaign to Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The indictment accuses him of having been an unregistered foreign agent for another Putin-aligned oligarch, the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. Trump wasn’t paying Manafort, who reportedly sold himself to the candidate by offering to work free. But he intended to profit from his connection with the campaign, emailing an associate, \"How do we use to get whole?\" If there were no other evidence against Trump, we could conclude that he was grotesquely irresponsible in opening his campaign up to corrupt foreign infiltration. But of course there is other evidence against Trump. His campaign was told that Russia wanted to help it, and it welcomed such help. On June 3, remember, the music publicist Rob Goldstone emailed Donald Trump Jr. to broker a Trump Tower meeting at which a Russian source would deliver \"very high level and sensitive information\" as \"part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.\" Trump Jr. responded with delight: \"If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\" The guilty plea by Papadopoulos indicates what information Trump Jr. might have been expecting. An obscure figure in foreign policy circles, Papadopoulos was one of five people who Trump listed as foreign policy advisers during a Washington Post editorial board meeting last year. A court filing, whose truth Papadopoulos affirms, says that in April 2016, he met with a professor who he \"understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials.\" The professor told him that Russians had \"dirt\" on Clinton, including \"thousands of emails.\" (The Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta had been hacked in March.) In the following months, Papadopoulos and his supervisors emailed back and forth about plans for a campaign trip to Russia. According to the court filing, one campaign official emailed another, \"We need someone to communicate that D.T. is not doing these trips.\" D.T. clearly stood for Donald Trump. The email continued, \"It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.\" Thanks to an August Washington Post story, we know that this email was sent by Manafort. Some have interpreted the exchange to mean that Manafort wanted a low-level person to decline the invitation, not to go to Russia. But the court filing also cites a \"campaign supervisor\" encouraging Papadopoulos and \"another foreign policy adviser\" to make the trip. Papadopoulos never went to Russia, but the foreign policy adviser Carter Page did. So here’s where we are. Trump put Manafort, an accused money-launderer and unregistered foreign agent, in charge of his campaign. Under Manafort’s watch, the campaign made at least two attempts to get compromising information about Clinton from Russia. Russia, in turn, provided hacked Democratic emails to WikiLeaks. Russia also ran a giant disinformation campaign against Clinton on social media and attempted to hack voting systems in at least 21 states. In response to Russia’s election meddling, Barack Obama’s administration imposed sanctions. Upon taking office, Trump reportedly made secret efforts to lift them. He fired the F.B.I. director James Comey to stop his investigation into \"this Russia thing,\" as he told Lester Holt. The day after the firing, he met with Russia’s foreign minister and its ambassador to America, and told them: \"I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.\" We’ve had a year of recriminations over the Clinton campaign’s failings, but Trump clawed out his minority victory only with the aid of a foreign intelligence service. On Monday we finally got indictments, but it’s been obvious for a year that this presidency is a crime.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/mueller-manafort-indictment.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Trump Won’t Bring Joy to Moolaville', 'text': ' Over the weekend Donald Trump raged against the Russia \"witch hunt,\" which he claimed was an effort to distract from his push for \"historic Tax Cuts & Reform.\" And there actually is a relationship — but it goes in the other direction. If Trump survives this crisis — which may mean that American democracy doesn’t — tax cuts will have a lot to do with it. For Republicans in Congress know perfectly well that Trump is utterly unfit for office and has been abusing his position for personal gain. Many of them surely suspected, long before Monday’s indictments, that members of his inner circle, and perhaps he himself, have colluded with a hostile foreign power. If they nonetheless circle the wagons around Trump — in particular, if they allow him to fire Robert Mueller, which now seems all too likely — there will be one main reason: Trump offers their big opportunity to cut taxes for the very wealthy. Indeed, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that almost 80 percent of the Trump tax cut would go to people with incomes over $1 million; these people would get an average cut of around $230,000 a year. But here’s what gets me: The wealthy donors for whom the G.O.P. will apparently do anything, up to and including covering up for possible treason, will get no joy from their tax cuts. I don’t mean that history will judge them harshly, although it will. I don’t even mean that plutocrats as well as plebeians will eventually suffer if America becomes a lawless, authoritarian regime. I mean that a few hundred thousand dollars extra will do little if anything to make the already wealthy more satisfied with their lives. You might well ask, who cares? Even if tax cuts would make the rich joyful, this shouldn’t count against the sheer misery Republicans are trying to impose on the tens of millions of people they’re trying to deprive of health care, food stamps, disability benefits and more. Still, for some reason I find it fascinating that all this misery, plus the possible destruction of constitutional government, may happen without even making the intended beneficiaries happy. To be fair, money is a nice thing to have, and I personally am by no means an ascetic. In New York 2017, in particular, life is good if and only if you can afford a decent place to live, which doesn’t come cheap. Furthermore, there’s a lot of evidence, both within and between countries, showing that other things being equal, having more money does make people happier. This evidence is, however, based on surveys that don’t capture what’s happening at the very top of the income scale. To figure out what extra money means at the top, you need to turn to less formal sources of insight. Take, for example, reactions to the Obama tax hike of 2013. Few people seem aware that the wealthy faced a pretty big tax increase that year — average federal taxes on the top 1 percent rose to 34 percent of income from 29 percent of income — thanks to expiration of part of the Bush tax cuts and the imposition of new taxes to help pay for Obamacare. So, do you remember widespread wailing and rending of garments among the economic elite? I don’t; many super-affluent Americans barely seemed to notice. Or take a fascinating Fortune article from 1955, reprinted a few years ago, describing the lives of top executives. At the time, thanks to income taxes and wage compression, such men were much poorer than their counterparts had been in 1930. The 1955 executive owned a motorboat, not a yacht, and \"gets along with one or two servants.\" Yet the article conveys a sense of men satisfied with their lives. Maybe all the wealth members of that class lost under the New Deal — and have regained many times over in our second Gilded Age — didn’t do much for their happiness? Now, obviously much of the pursuit of wealth is really about status and power — as Tom Wolfe wrote in 1968, it’s about \"seeing ’em jump.\" You can see this in Trump’s personal taste in furnishings, which a Politico article perceptively described as \"dictator chic\" — designed not to be comfortable, but to impress and intimidate. But a tax cut that goes to almost all wealthy Americans doesn’t even deliver the kind of status payoff many of the truly rich crave, since the guy in the mansion next door gets the same cut. Again, arguably none of this matters very much. The G.O.P. policy agenda of rewarding the wealthy at the expense of the poor and working class would be vile even if tax cuts would make the rich ecstatic. The party’s willingness to turn a blind eye to corruption with a hint of treason would be horrifying whatever the motivation. Still, there seems to me to be an extra dimension of awfulness to the whole situation once you realize that all this betrayal serves no real purpose, not even a bad one. And maybe, just maybe, members of the G.O.P. donor class will take this moment of national crisis to ask themselves what really matters. For what shall it profit a man, if he gain a $230,000 tax cut, and his formerly democratic nation lose its soul?', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/trump-tax-cuts-rich.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'When Politics Becomes Your Idol', 'text': ' I didn’t get to Richard Linklater’s brilliant 2014 movie, \"Boyhood,\" until this past weekend. That was the movie, filmed over 12 years with the same actors, about a boy growing up in Texas. But I did have the advantage of seeing it in the Trump era. It’s a sadder movie now. Different themes leap out at you, which were not as prominent in the reviews written three years ago. What you see is good people desperately trying to connect in an America where bonds are attenuated — without stable families, tight communities, stable careers, ethnic roots or an enveloping moral culture. There’s just a whirl of changing stepfathers, changing homes, changing phone distractions, changing pop-culture references, financial stress and chronic drinking, which make it harder to sink down roots into something, or to even have a spiritual narrative that gives meaning to life. You can see why, in the disrupted landscape depicted in the film, people would form the sort of partisan attachments that are common today. Today, partisanship for many people is not about which party has the better policies, as it was, say, in the days of Eisenhower and Kennedy. It’s not even about which party has the better philosophy, as it was in the Reagan era. These days, partisanship is often totalistic. People often use partisan identity to fill the void left when their other attachments wither away — religious, ethnic, communal and familial. Last week my colleague Thomas Edsall quoted a political scientist, Alex Theodoridis, who noted this phenomenon: \"Partisanship for many Americans today takes the form of a visceral, even subconscious, attachment to a party group. Our party becomes a part of our self-concept in deep and meaningful ways.\" When politics is used as a cure for spiritual and social loneliness, it’s harder to win people over with policy or philosophical arguments. Everything is shaped on a deeper level, through the parables, fables and myths that our most fundamental groups use to define themselves. For years, the meritocratic establishments in both parties told an implicit myth. The heroes of this myth were educated, morally enlightened global citizens who went to competitive colleges, got invited to things like the Clinton Global Initiative, and who have the brainpower to run society and who might just be a little better than other people, by virtue of their achievements. Donald Trump tells the opposite myth — about how those meritocrats are actually clueless idiots and full of drivel, and how virtue, wisdom and toughness is found in the regular people whom those folks look down upon. Trump’s supporters follow him because he gets his facts wrong, but he gets his myths right. He tells the morality tale that works for them. It should be said that people on the left and on the right who try to use politics to find their moral meaning are turning politics into an idol. Idolatry is what happens when people give ultimate allegiance to something that should be serving only an intermediate purpose, whether it is money, technology, alcohol, success or politics. As Andy Crouch points out in his book \"Playing God,\" idolatry is seductive because in the first phase it seems to work. The first sip of that martini tastes great. At first a new smartphone seems to give you power and control. The status you get from a new burst of success seems really sensational. But then idols fail. What seemed to offer you more control begins to control you. As Crouch puts it: \"All idols begin by offering great things for a very small price. All idols then fail, more and more consistently, to deliver on their original promises, while ratcheting up their demands. ... In the end they fail completely, even as they make categorical demands. In the memorable phrase of the psychiatrist Jeffrey Satinover, idols ask for more and more, while giving less and less, until eventually they demand everything and give nothing.\" Politics these days makes categorical demands on people. It demands that they remain in a state of febrile excitement caused by this or that scandal or hatred of the moment. But it doesn’t actually transform life or even fill the hole left by the lack of other attachments. If politics is going to get better we need better myths, unifying ones that are built on social equality. But we also need to put politics in its place. The excessive dependence on politics has to be displaced by the expulsive power of more important dependencies, whether family, friendship, neighborhood, community, faith or basic life creed. To be a moderate is to be at war with idolatry. It’s to believe that we become free as we multiply and balance our attachments. It’s to believe that our politics probably can’t be fixed by political means. It needs repair of the deeper communal bonds that politics rest on, and which political conflict cannot heal.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/opinion/when-politics-becomes-your-idol.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'When the Kitchen Isn’t Safe for Women', 'text': ' In 2010, I took a job at a New York City Applebee’s. I said I was considering culinary school and wanted to get some experience in a real kitchen, but I was actually there to write about the experience for a book. I had grand plans to take a genre steeped in machismo and tell a woman’s story instead. I got what I was after, though not in the way I had hoped. My kitchen stint included sexual harassment so common that it became background noise, and a sexual assault, which did not. In the wake of more than two dozen women asserting that the Besh Restaurant Group in New Orleans fostered a culture of sexual harassment, I have been torn. Half of me is rolling my eyes at how predictable it is. The other half is blind with outrage: At the people described as perpetrators, and the industry leaders who’ve stayed silent. But I’m most confounded by the people who have profited off the mythology of kitchens as places where, as a famous chef once said, \"conversation tends to center on\" — to paraphrase — male genital proportions and preferred sexual acts. You don’t need to find a secret text from a chef to read a more specific and colorful version of that. It’s in Anthony Bourdain’s best-selling book, \"Kitchen Confidential,\" which has been a siren song of kitchen machismo in food media since its publication in 2000. These kinds of stories, which aren’t limited to Mr. Bourdain, have set the standard for what people expect working in a restaurant to be like. For anyone inclined to believe in American meritocracy, they offer a raunchy yet appealing vision of the world: So long as a woman has a thick skin and works hard, she’ll be just fine. This is powerfully seductive. I should know, because I once fell for it, too. In the kitchen, I aimed to prove I was tough. I rolled my eyes when men ogled me; I responded to attempts at flirtation with epithets and smiles. When a manager reprimanded a cook for calling me mamí, I brushed it off. \"It’s cool,\" I said. \"I’ve been called worse.\" On my last night on the job, I drank on the line, like most everyone else. Everything from there is unclear, because — from what I was able to gather — one of the cooks had drugged my drink. Apparently, a crew of colleagues, all but one of them men, took me to a house to \"party\" after work. I’ve been told that the man who drugged me tried to take me home with him, but the other woman who’d come along prevented this. I got into a bed, and some other guy decided to do what he liked with me. I do not remember this. I reported the assault to the police, but could never bring myself to ask for specifics. The handprint-shaped bruise I had on my thigh gave me enough to think about. For a long time, I couldn’t believe I had been so stupid. How could I have missed that I was in a dangerous place? Here’s how: I bought into the idea that talk in the kitchen was just talk, and that a thick skin would indeed protect me. But it wasn’t and it didn’t, because a sexualized workplace is a dangerous workplace for women. When the entire culture of a place is lewd, it makes it impossible to tell which men are dangerous. The raunchiest man in the kitchen had no part in the assault, but a quieter cook apparently did. In the din of dirty kitchen-speak, I could not have told you the difference between them. The urgency of this problem was harder to see a generation ago, when kitchens were relatively marginal workplaces. That is no longer the case. Today restaurants are central to our culture and our economy. As the cult of celebrity chefs has grown, annual restaurant sales have more than doubled since 2001 to just under $800 billion. The National Restaurant Association says its industry employs nearly one-tenth of all workers. Last year, restaurant jobs exceeded 9.1 million, more than half held by women. This makes restaurants mainstream, professional workplaces, and that is true for both a social media manager for the Besh restaurants, or a teenage server at an IHOP. Whatever degree of glamour in a particular job, harassment in restaurants is nearly universal. Two-thirds of female restaurant workers reported experiencing sexual harassment from management in a 2014 survey, and 80 percent reported it from co-workers, according to research from advocacy group Restaurant Opportunities Center United. The most common type reported was the kind of sexual teasing and jokes that had preceded my assault. Most women responded the same way I did: They ignored it. Women ignore such behavior out of self-preservation, but men ignore it because it is easy and acceptable to do so. It sounds as if that was the strategy for Mr. Bourdain, who gave an interview to Slate last week. Around bro culture, he said, \"I was so uncomfortable.\" But when it came to being the bad boy, he also \"played that role and went along with it.\" So have most male chefs and food writers. Like me, women who experience the darker side of kitchen work don’t need men who’ve benefited and profited from its pervasively sexist culture to apologize and shrug. We need them to actively disown it, and then work, loudly and alongside women, to change it.

But an additional reality should be noted: Without a constitutional convention, the only way to amend the State Constitution is through the Legislature, and the Legislature has fervently resisted reforming Albany’s well-documented legacy of corruption and dysfunction. The opportunity for the public to convene a convention won’t come again for 20 years. How can we leave reform in the Legislature’s hands until then? EVAN A. DAVIS, NEW YORK The writer is manager of the Committee for a Constitutional Convention. To the Editor: Not only labor unions are strongly opposed to a constitutional convention. Public defenders throughout the state share that opposition, but for other profound reasons. A convention could potentially compromise vital protections that many of our low-income clients depend on. One provision is Article 17, which mandates that the state provide aid to the needy. In practical terms, it guarantees a right to shelter for the homeless, ensures that immigrants have access to medical care and helps our attorneys protect clients from eviction. Far from unfounded fear, our concern for Article 17 stems from multiple attempts to gut it over the years. Progressives who favor a convention pledge that Article 17 will be spared, but this is a guarantee that no one can give. And when political horse trading is involved, all too often, it is our clients’ rights that are the first to go. A constitutional convention is a risky game of chance.

The Cabaret Law was created during Prohibition to patrol speakeasies, and while its restrictions on musicians came and went, the ban on social dancing has remained — leaving generations of club owners flicking the lights or playing \"Eleanor Rigby\" to still the crowd, lest they be fined or padlocked by the police in midnight raids. It is an odd and archaic regulation in a city that thinks of itself as a night life capital, but one that has resisted multiple attempts at repeal. That is expected to end on Tuesday, when a bill introduced by Rafael Espinal, a councilman from Brooklyn, comes before the City Council. Mr. Espinal, who embraced an effort by advocates in his district, which includes Bushwick, where bars and D.I.Y. venues have proliferated in recent years, says he has the 26 votes needed to pass it. \"It’s over,\" he said of the law. In New York City, only 97 out of roughly 25,000 eating and drinking establishments have a cabaret license. Obtaining one is costly and time-consuming, requiring the approval of several agencies, and only businesses in areas zoned for commercial manufacturing are eligible. Though the law has not been aggressively enforced since the Giuliani administration, it keeps bar and club owners \"living in fear,\" said Mr. Espinal, and pushes dancers from safe, regulated spaces into potentially hazardous underground ones. A spokesman for the mayor, Ben Sarle, said in an email, \"The mayor strongly supports repealing the law,\" though he emphasized the need to retain some of its security requirements, such as mandatory security cameras and certified security guards at larger venues, which were added to the existing law in the last 15 years. Norman Siegel, the former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, tried unsuccessfully to strike down the Cabaret Law, filing a lawsuit in state court around a decade ago alongside Paul Chevigny, a civil rights lawyer, arguing it violated dancers’ free speech rights. Mr. Siegel reacted with joy to the possibility that it could be repealed. \"Hallelujah to that,\" he said. \"It was used periodically to be very repressive on free expression.\" The Cabaret Law was enacted in 1926. It made it illegal to host \"musical entertainment, singing, dancing or other form of amusement\" without a license. The law is widely believed to have originally been used to target racially mixed jazz clubs in Harlem, but it was broadly applied. Music was not permitted at unlicensed bars at all until 1936, when the law was amended  to allow radio- and piano-playing. The same year, operators of a ship that had taken men from the Bowery Mission on a day cruise were fined for running an unlicensed cabaret because a tap dancer was on board. From 1940 to 1967, the city required performers and employees of cabarets to be fingerprinted and carry \"cabaret cards,\" which could be denied if the applicant had a police record. The star-studded list of musicians who were denied cards or had them revoked includes Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker. \"Billie Holiday could not get a club date for many years before her death because she had a narcotics record. Ray Charles the blind blues singer cannot work here for the same reason,\" an article in The Times noted in 1966. Frank Sinatra refused to sing in New York for years rather than submit to the indignity of the required fingerprinting. Around the same time, Greenwich Village coffeehouses were fined for operating as unlicensed cabarets after hosting musicians. Clubs were shut down if they violated a so-called three-musician rule, which, until it was challenged by Mr. Chevigny in the late 1980s, permitted unlicensed venues to host no more than three musicians, who, for a long time, were also barred from playing wind and percussion instruments. In the 1990s, under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the city revived the Cabaret Law, using it to shut down dance clubs as part of its quality-of-life initiatives. As rave culture bloomed around the world, New Yorkers learned their city had a no-dancing law, sometimes only when a task force — known as March, for Multi Agency Response to Community Hotspots — swooped in. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration has issued relatively few citations, but Mr. Espinal said he found a groundswell of support for a repeal in Bushwick this year. At a town-hall meeting about night life initiatives at Market Hotel this spring, advocates immediately steered the conversation toward the Cabaret Law. \"We came in sort of as a flash mob,\" said John Barclay, who runs Bossa Nova Civic Club in Bushwick, which does not have a cabaret license. Andrew Muchmore, a lawyer and bar owner, filed a still-pending lawsuit against the city after his bar, Muchmore’s, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was slapped with a cabaret violation in 2013 by a police officer who spotted people \"swaying\" at a rock show while investigating a noise complaint, Mr. Muchmore said. His legal argument focused on how the law limits the type of music venues can feature, infringing freedom of expression, and a decision by the judge early in the case indicated a possibility that the law could be invalidated on First Amendment grounds. \"We couldn’t have entire genres — Latin music of any kind, electronic. We had to censor our music to make sure no one danced,\" he said. Opponents of the law have also emphasized its ultimate effect. \"When we stop people from dancing, they go straight to these warehouses,\" Mr. Barclay said, recalling a recent deadly fire in the Ghost Ship warehouse in Oakland, Calif. \"People haven’t stopped dancing, they’re just dancing in these extremely unsafe, unregulated environments.\" The advocates testified at hearings, lobbied council members and addressed concerns raised by community boards. \"If people are concerned that it’s going to turn into Coachella in their neighborhood, there are departments that are already regulating noise, fire, everything. It’s hyper-regulated,\" said Mr. Barclay. \"The only thing we are asking is to move our bodies rhythmically. That’s it.\" On Friday, Councilman Espinal and about a dozen advocates gathered at Muchmore’s for a pub-crawl in advance of Tuesday’s vote. The group included members of NYC Artist Coalition, Dance Liberation Network, Legalize Dance NYC, and the founder of the annual Dance Parade, which started around a decade ago to protest the law. They carried handouts that said \"Let NYC Dance\" and \"Did you know social dancing is illegal in NYC? It’s enforced on the most vulnerable.\" At Bossa Nova Civic Club, people swayed in the haze created by a smoke machine. \"You can’t dance in New York?\" said Janina Butz, a German fashion designer who lives in Brooklyn. \"In Germany, you can’t dance on Easter and I thought that was crazy,\" she said. At Happyfun Hideaway, a bar owned by one of the advocates, people bopped in Halloween costumes and Koa Pennock handed out shots of whiskey to friends. \"It’s just a bully mentality,\" he said of the Cabaret Law. \"Remember ‘Footloose’?\" asked his friend Beau Becerra, referring to the 1984 film starring Kevin Bacon about a fictional town that forbids dancing. \"Like Kevin taught us,\" he said, holding up his shot glass for a toast, \"we should just dance.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/new-york-cabaret-law-repeal.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Two New York Detectives Are Charged With Rape and Kidnapping', 'text': ' Minutes after two New York detectives stopped an 18-year-old Brooklyn woman last month for having marijuana in her car, they placed her into handcuffs and put her into their police van, prosecutors said. Describing himself and his partner as \"freaks,\" one of the detectives forced the young woman to perform oral sex on him and raped her, prosecutors said, switching places within moments to let the other assault her, too. This chilling account was offered in court on Monday morning as the Brooklyn district attorney’s office unsealed a 50-count indictment against the detectives, Edward Martins and Richard Hall, charging them with rape, kidnapping and official misconduct. The indictment marked the district attorney’s office’s first formal statement on the allegations, details of which have been emerging in the news media for weeks. Detective Hall, 33, and Detective Martins, 37, surrendered on Monday at the 94th Precinct station house in Williamsburg. At their arraignment in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, both pleaded not guilty and were released on bail. Their lawyers vowed to vigorously fight the charges, arguing that prosecutors had given too much credence to the woman’s \"uncorroborated\" claims and suggesting that the encounter was consensual. Even in a city that has seen its share of police corruption — from the systemic graft revealed by Frank Serpico in 1970s to the brutal attack of Abner Louima, who was sexually assaulted in 1997 by an officer wielding a broomstick — the allegations against Detectives Hall and Martins were remarkable for both the viciousness of the crimes and the raw abuse of power. Typically, when officers are charged with crimes, their colleagues come to court in a sea of blue uniforms to support them. But on Monday, not one officer appeared in court with Detectives Martins and Hall. According to a detailed account delivered by a prosecutor, Frank DeGaetano, the incident occurred on Sept. 15, when Detectives Hall and Martins were conducting operations in the Coney Island neighborhood as part of an antidrug unit, Brooklyn South Narcotics. Around 8 p.m., Mr. DeGaetano said, the detectives broke off from the rest of their team and stopped an Infinity coupe in Calvert Vaux Park. The 18-year-old woman was driving, he said; two of her friends, both men, were also in the car. As the detectives — both in plainclothes — approached the car, one of them shined his flashlight through the window and saw the young woman adjusting her bra. When Detective Hall asked if she was hiding something, she told him she was simply adjusting her nipple piercing, Mr. DeGaetano said. The detectives asked her to prove it, and the young woman lifted up her shirt, showing them her breasts. A search of the car revealed a small amount of marijuana in a cup holder. The woman also had some marijuana and a few pills of Klonopin, an anti-anxiety drug, in her handbag, Mr. DeGaetano said. At that point, he added, the detectives took the woman from the car, placed her in handcuffs and put her into the second row of their Dodge police van. Driving off, they told her that she would be released within a few hours at the 60th Precinct station house. Mr. DeGaetano said that Detective Martins used his cellphone to call the woman’s friends and explicitly instructed them not to follow the van, using a blocking function to disguise the number he was calling from. It was then that Detective Martins sat down next to the woman and said that he and his partner were \"freaks,\" asking her what she wanted to do to avoid being arrested, Mr. DeGaetano said. After tightening the handcuffs, Detective Martins pulled out his penis and forced the woman to perform oral sex on him, Mr. DeGaetano said. Then he turned her around, pulled her pants down and raped her, Mr. DeGaetano added, as Detective Hall watched through the rearview mirror and the young woman cried and pleaded with Detective Martins to stop. By that point, Mr. DeGaetano said, the van was in Bay Ridge, at least four miles from where the antidrug team had been working. Mr. DeGaetano said that Detective Hall switched places with his partner and also forced the woman to perform oral sex on him. After the attack, Mr. DeGaetano said, the detectives returned to Coney Island and dropped the woman off about five blocks from their station house. Before she left, they made her take one of her Klonopin pills and told her to \"keep her mouth shut,\" Mr. DeGaetano said. Within days, the city medical examiner’s office had analyzed a rape test performed on the woman and determined that it contained samples of both detectives’ sperm, Mr. DeGaetano said. \"These are extremely serious charges,\" he added, saying that each could face up to 25 years in prison. Detective Martins, who joined the Police Department in July 2006, had his bail set at $250,000, and Detective Hall, who joined in July 2010, had his bail set at $150,000. Both were suspended and demoted on Friday, after the grand jury handed up the indictment. Even with physical evidence like DNA, rape prosecutions are often difficult. A court document filed on Monday hinted at some of the vulnerabilities defense lawyers may seek to exploit. One day after the encounter, investigators from the Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau interviewed her and found she that while she could identify Detective Hall from a photo array, she was unable to identify Detective Martins, according to the court document. The document also showed that her two friends were also unable to identify Detective Martins and that one of them misidentified Detective Hall. Calling the indictment \"schizophrenic,\" John Arlia, a lawyer for Detective Hall, noted at the arraignment that the charges included accusations of both \"forcible\" rape and of using sex to bribe a police officer — a \"self-contradictory\" position, suggesting that the prosecutors had two theories of the case and were not entirely confident about the young woman’s account. Mark A. Bederow, Detective Martins’s lawyer, said his client had been subjected for weeks to a \"circus\" of allegations made in the media by the young woman’s lawyer, Michael David. Mr. Bederow called the woman’s account \"uncorroborated.\" He told Justice Danny K. Chun, who is handling the case, that while prosecutors had furnished DNA evidence, they had not provided surveillance footage connected to the attack, which allegedly took place in the parking lot of a Chipotle restaurant, nor of the detectives releasing the woman near the station house. Mr. Bederow added that he had \"substantial information\" that would undermine her story, suggesting that she had a \"financial\" motive to lie about the attack. At a news conference after the arraignment, Eric Gonzalez, the acting Brooklyn district attorney, asked anyone who may have had similar encounters with the detectives to come forward. He also condemned the detectives’ lawyers for attacking the victim. \"It is shocking and unfortunate that they would blame a teenager for the acts of their clients,\" Mr. Gonzalez said. \"To think that these are grown men in a position of power over an 18-year-old, and for them to blame her, is ridiculous and demeaning. To my mind it speaks to desperation.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/nypd-detectives-rape-kidnapping-charges.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'City Announces $8 Million Plan to Prevent Bullying in Schools', 'text': ' A month after a fatal school stabbing by a student who said he was tormented by his classmates, the schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, said at a City Council hearing on Monday that the Department of Education would take new steps to prevent bullying. Ms. Fariña said the city will create an online portal where families can report instances of bullying, harassment or discrimination, though it will not be launched until 2019. The department will also require schools to create \"individual student action plans\" if there are several substantiated allegations of bullying against one child. Three hundred schools with high rates of bullying will receive targeted training and support, and bullied students will be able to request a transfer to a new school. The department said the new push will cost $8 million. The de Blasio administration has taken a gentle approach to school discipline, encouraging practices that emphasize relationships and communication over more punitive measures, and during Mayor Bill de Blasio’s tenure, data on school safety and suspensions show that crime and suspensions in the schools have fallen. But the data are far from perfect, and some critics question the portrait of safer schools. The department was forced to address the issue last month, when Abel Cedeno, 18, stabbed two of his classmates, Ariane Laboy, 16, and Matthew McCree, 15, at the Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation in the Bronx. Mr. McCree died from his injuries. Mr. Cedeno said he had been bullied at school, though that day was the first he and the two stabbing victims had clashed. According to school surveys taken in recent years, students at Wildlife Conservation said they felt increasingly unsafe and bullying appears to have been rampant. In February, a sixth- grader at Wildlife Conservation tried to hang himself  after enduring relentless bullying by his peers. He and his grandmother had complained repeatedly to administrators, but they said that only served to make the torment worse. On Friday, the day The New York Times published an article about the suicide attempt, the Education Department announced that the school principal, Astrid Jacobo, had been removed. Previously, in an interview on NY1, Ms. Fariña had been asked about \"red flags\" at the school, and she said that she had been to the school four times since the stabbing the last month and did not \"think that that was something that was really apparent.\" The city’s Special Commissioner of Investigation has started an inquiry of the school. On Monday, the Education Department also released the latest suspension data for the 2016-17 school year, which showed that suspensions have declined by 6.4 percent from the previous year. In her testimony, Ms. Fariña said in the spring of 2016, restorative practices — where students discuss their conflicts and relationships — were implemented at schools with high rates of incidents. In those schools, the suspensions decreased by 23.1 percent over the previous year and 38.5 percent from two years earlier. A decline in suspensions does not necessarily indicate that students are better behaved. The de Blasio administration has encouraged principals to move away from suspensions, heeding the advice of many child advocacy organizations that say that sending students out of the classroom does not address underlying issues. \"Suspensions being down is meaningless,\" said Gregory Floyd, president of Local 237 Teamsters, the union that represents school safety agents. \"The numbers show suspensions are down, the numbers show incidents are down,\" he said. \"If you’re not reporting it, does that mean it didn’t happen?\" At the School for Wildlife Conservation, there were 91 suspensions or \"removals,\" or when students were barred from class, reported to the city last year — 75 of those were principal suspensions, which can last as long as five days. Despite the citywide decrease in suspensions, much of the Bronx moved in the other direction. In four of the six school districts in the borough, there were more suspensions in the last school year than the previous year.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/plan-to-prevent-bullying-in-new-york-schools.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'In Court and Out, a de Blasio Donor Is Branded a Liar', 'text': ' The attacks have come at news conferences and in court, framed as questions or asserted as fact. But no matter their form, the salvos against the credibility of Jona S. Rechnitz, a donor to Mayor Bill de Blasio who says he bought access to the mayor and other city officials, have shared a single premise: \"Mr. Rechnitz, you are a liar, correct?\" That most recent iteration of the accusation came on Monday from Henry Mazurek, a defense lawyer in a federal corruption trial in which Mr. Rechnitz is a key government witness. Over the past three days of testimony in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Rechnitz has made explosive claims about how he traded gifts and donations for political favors and influence. And over the past few days, Mr. Rechnitz’s credibility has come under vigorous, often vitriolic attack, as both defense lawyers and the mayor have sought to undermine him in the court of law as well as in the court of public opinion. On Sunday, Mr. de Blasio — whom Mr. Rechnitz said he spoke to weekly during the mayor’s 2013 campaign — called his former donor a liar and a felon. The mayor’s comments, at an unrelated announcement about storm protection in the Rockaways, echoed his remarks from the day before, when he called Mr. Rechnitz a \"horrible human being.\" Mr. Rechnitz’s claims come at an inconvenient time for Mr. de Blasio, with the mayoral election on Nov. 7. But even if the allegations do not harm the mayor’s re-election prospects — Mr. de Blasio holds a commanding lead in the polls — they have brought a political headache back to life, with the mayor’s photo splashed across the city’s tabloids all weekend. Mr. Rechnitz, a wealthy real estate scion, and his friend Jeremy Reichberg were key figures in federal and state inquiries into pay-to-play accusations against Mr. de Blasio. Prosecutors eventually decided not to bring charges — a fact Mr. de Blasio repeatedly highlighted on Sunday. \"The federal government looked at this in excruciating detail, but you somehow want to elevate a criminal to the front pages as having equal validity to federal prosecutors,\" he told reporters. \"If you want to do that, feel free.\" In court, defense lawyers were equally aggressive in their efforts to erode Mr. Rechnitz’s credibility. Mr. Rechnitz, who pleaded guilty to a fraud conspiracy charge, is cooperating with the government in its case against Norman Seabrook, the former head of the city’s correction officers’ union, and Murray Huberfeld, a hedge fund financier accused of bribing him. But Mr. Mazurek, Mr. Huberfeld’s lawyer, sought to show that Mr. Rechnitz lied to investigators both before and after he signed his cooperation agreement — and perhaps continued to lie on Monday on the witness stand. When Mr. Mazurek asked Mr. Rechnitz about statements he had made to federal agents claiming not to remember whether he had sex with a prostitute aboard a private jet he chartered for several police officers, Mr. Rechnitz denied ever making those statements. In response, Mr. Mazurek read aloud the agents’ report on the statements. \"I never said that,\" Mr. Rechnitz said. Mr. Rechnitz made no effort to endear himself to jurors. He was alternately combative, flip and sullen. When asked to confirm answers he had given just days before, he often declined to give a straightforward answer. \"If you say so,\" he said once, or, \"It could be I said those words, sure.\" \"I had lied to investigators until I came forward and told them the truth,\" he said at another point. And there was this bit of verbal acrobatics: \"Are you able to tell the difference between the truth and a lie?\" Mr. Mazurek asked. \"I don’t understand the question,\" Mr. Rechnitz replied. Several times, Mr. Rechnitz’s responses elicited audible reactions from audience members, prompting a warning from Judge Andrew L. Carter Jr. Most notably, Mr. Mazurek highlighted a conversation Mr. Rechnitz had with federal agents when he was being questioned about his involvement with city police officers, whom he has admitted showering with gifts in order to secure favors. Mr. Rechnitz had initially told investigators that he had sought relationships with officers because, as the grandson of Holocaust survivors, he was taught to befriend law enforcement officials to \"help ensure the mistakes of the past were not repeated,\" Mr. Mazurek said. \"I was trying to wiggle my way out of the truth,\" Mr. Rechnitz said. \"And you invoked the memory of the Holocaust to wiggle your way out of the truth?\" Mr. Mazurek said. \"It sounds that way, yes,\" Mr. Rechnitz responded.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/jona-rechnitz-bill-de-blasio.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'As Election Nears, Mayor de Blasio Spends a Day With Bernie Sanders', 'text': ' Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday seemed like a candidate fighting hard to keep his job, instead of one coasting to re-election. Dogged by questions about favors for donors, Mr. de Blasio found himself on a hot and delayed subway train with Senator Bernie Sanders, using the popular liberal from Vermont to rekindle a policy dispute with the governor. A bit earlier, the mayor had accepted the endorsement of another senator, Chuck Schumer of New York, at Grand Central Terminal before heading over to Penn Station to meet Mr. Sanders, who came to the city to offer support for Mr. de Blasio and immediately rode an A train with him, trailed by a gaggle of reporters. \"Hillary Clinton couldn’t do it,\" Mr. Sanders quipped with satisfaction after successfully swiping his MetroCard, a reference to Mrs. Clinton’s struggles at the subway turnstile during the 2016 campaign. \"It’s your New York soul coming out,\" the mayor replied, in reference to Mr. Sanders’s Brooklyn roots, as the two climbed the stairs to the 34th Street platform. \"Someone asked me about it the other day, and I said I missed the tokens.\" (Mr. Sanders took heat in 2016 for suggesting tokens were still used on the city’s trains.) After their ride, the pair arrived at a campaign-style event in the glittering new Fulton Center, a shopping center and subway hub near Wall Street, surrounded by supportive unions and Democratic politicians. Mr. de Blasio pushed once again for a tax on wealthy New Yorkers to support transit spending and provide discounted rides to the poor. \"You go outside, and walk a few blocks away, you will see the offices of the millionaires and billionaires who dominate this nation,\" Mr. de Blasio said. \"My friends, I know where the money is.\" Mr. Sanders, who was expected to hold an endorsement rally with Mr. de Blasio Monday night, said he supported the mayor’s plan. But he said he did not intend to pick sides in a dispute over transit funding between Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has declared the mayor’s tax hike a non-starter in the Republican-dominated State Senate. \"I’m not taking sides, to be honest with you. I’ve got enough to keep me busy in Washington,\" said Mr. Sanders, adding he just thought the mayor’s tax-the-rich plan was a good idea. \"I think it’s the right thing to do.\" Asked if he therefore thought Mr. Cuomo was wrong to support the idea of raising money for the subways by charging drivers more to enter high-traffic areas of the city, Mr. Sanders demurred. \"I know you want to get me into a feud with the governor,\" Mr. Sanders said, drawing laughs. \"We’ll leave it be.\" In a statement, Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, called the funding tax \"politically popular\" but \"impossible to pass\" through Albany. \"It’s not a real alternative,\" she said. \"It just sounds good.\" With a schedule full of marquee political names, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, appeared eager on Monday to put behind him days of uncomfortable questions about his closeness to a high-dollar donor who pleaded guilty to federal fraud, and is cooperating with prosecutors in an another case. The accusations fueled new rounds of negative headlines for the mayor and have animated the campaigns of his two main challengers, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican, and the independent candidate Bo Dietl, both of whom are expected to face Mr. de Blasio in a second and final debate on Wednesday. The donor, Jona S. Rechnitz, has been testifying for days in the corruption trial of a former union boss about his contacts with the mayor after making tens of thousands in contributions. Mr. de Blasio faced questions at two news conferences over the weekend, including one to directly address the claims by the donor, whom the mayor on Saturday repeatedly attacked as \"a liar and a felon.\" The mayor, who enjoyed a 40-point lead in polls early this month, has pointed out that the testimony involves accusations of pay-to-play activities by the de Blasio administration that investigators already looked into. No charges were brought against Mr. de Blasio or any of his staff. But questions about his contacts with Mr. Rechnitz, a young and wealthy real estate investor who testified that he had a direct line to the mayor after giving well over $100,000 to his campaign and political causes, shadowed Mr. de Blasio throughout the day. Mr. Schumer, a Democrat, declined to address several questions about whether the testimony weighed on his endorsement, which had been slated for Saturday but was rescheduled so that Mr. de Blasio could address the claims by Mr. Rechnitz. \"The mayor has done an outstanding job, he’s answered questions on those issues,\" Senator Schumer said. \" I’m proud to endorse him.\" He then read a statement about the federal charges against President Trump’s campaign manger, Paul Manafort, and left eight minutes after arriving. Mr. Sanders, an independent, likewise did not respond when asked about the issue at a later news conference, instead inviting Mr. de Blasio to take the question. But by that point, Mr. de Blasio appeared to have been buoyed by the energy of his chaotic subway ride with Mr. Sanders, which included supportive hoots from riders, even though most of them were directed at the Vermont senator. (The mayor endorsed Mrs. Clinton in 2016, but has since embraced Mr. Sanders.) The mayor and Mr. Sanders experienced the full panoply of the subways circa 2017: a 10-minute delay for their train because of an \"earlier incident\"; the screeching of trains in the other direction; a duo who sang and rapped for the two politicians; a train car packed wall-to-wall. \"Welcome to the A train, Bernie!\" a woman called out.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-bernie-sanders-subway.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'For a Grieving Teenager, Much-Needed Companionship (on 2 and 4 Legs)', 'text': ' Providencia Vanderpool was reminiscing with her youngest son about his father when suddenly the boy’s words alarmed her. Her son, Noel, asked if she was starting to forget her husband, who died in 2014. \"I asked, ‘Why would you say that?’\" Mrs. Vanderpool, 50, recalled recently. \"He said, ‘Because you don’t talk about him every day.’ But I remember him every single day.\" Mrs. Vanderpool knows she will never forget the man she was married to for three decades, but fears that Noel’s memories will fade. Their two other children, Kirk and Rick, were in their 20s when their father died. Noel was only 11. And he never got to say goodbye. Battling kidney disease for years, her husband, Ricardo Vanderpool, had a heart attack after a two-week hospitalization. Mrs. Vanderpool did not bring Noel to the hospital. \"I don’t think he would have wanted Noel to see him like that,\" she said. While she feels that she honored her husband’s wishes by keeping Noel away, she also feels plagued by guilt that he did not see his father one last time. Mrs. Vanderpool, who met her husband when she was 14, keeps his spirit alive through stories and photographs in her apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Thousands more pictures are stacked in boxes. \"When I go to someone’s house, and they don’t have pictures, it’s not alive,\" Mrs. Vanderpool said. \"I like to see a family. I like to see a story.\" For her story, Mrs. Vanderpool points to pictures of herself and her husband lounging on a cruise ship, and in costume at Comic Con, where she dressed as the \"Harry Potter\" character Hermione Granger, and he as a colonel. There are pictures of each child’s first bath and first day of school, others with them playing video games or napping with their father. Mr. Vanderpool’s absence had an immediate impact on Noel’s behavior. He got in fights at school, one provoked by a classmate who had mocked him for praying that his father would return to life. \"His grades were terrible,\" Mrs. Vanderpool said. \"He started failing. He wasn’t paying attention. It was a struggle to send him to school.\" Mrs. Vanderpool got Noel a Yorkshire terrier named Jack to provide him with much-needed companionship, and she also sought to find Noel a confidant outside the family. In May, Noel, now 14, was matched with a big brother through Catholic Big Sisters & Big Brothers, an affiliate of Catholic Charities, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Enter Ben Green, from Dublin, who moved to New York City with his wife seven years ago. \"My thinking of it is just to give him another outlet to talk to someone else, if he wants,\" Mr. Green, 35, said. \"I don’t push any agenda. If he wants to talk about something, I’m there to listen and help him think through stuff. Or to not talk and just wander around.\" Noel recently started his freshman year at New Design High School. Mrs. Vanderpool says Noel is on time for appointments and engaged in his studies, a difference she credits to Mr. Green and his active role in Noel’s life. \"I haven’t gotten one single call yet,\" Mrs. Vanderpool said. \"I just paid the teachers off,\" Noel joked. The family faced another setback last year when Mrs. Vanderpool learned she had kidney cancer. Doctors performed surgery to remove a tumor, and she spent three and a half months away from her job. Mrs. Vanderpool works in social services and earns $42,000 a year. Her monthly bills include $541 in rent and $500 for food, as well as a number of other expenses, including helping her mother, who has multiple sclerosis, with her bills. Additionally, Mrs. Vanderpool owes about $60,000 in student loans. Catholic Charities used $340 from the Neediest Cases Fund at the start of the academic year to buy Noel new school clothes, including a winter coat and sneakers, and to buy work clothes for Mrs. Vanderpool. Additionally, Catholic Big Sisters & Big Brothers gave Noel a new backpack filled with school supplies. Noel usually meets with Mr. Green every other week. Mr. Green, who works for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, chose the New York Transit Museum as one of their first outings. Other activities have included a bike ride near the South Street Seaport, a visit to the Irish Hunger Memorial in Battery Park City and an exploration of Green-Wood Cemetery and its mausoleums in Brooklyn. \"After you’ve been here a few years, your circle of the city shrinks,\" Mr. Green said. \"So it’s good for both of us to go out and explore neighborhoods.\" So far, Mr. Green has chosen all of the activities, but he expects that Noel will begin proposing ideas as he continues to emerge from his shell. \"He’s not a bad kid,\" Mrs. Vanderpool said. \"He’s a good kid who had something terrible happen to him.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/nyregion/for-a-grieving-teenager-much-needed-companionship-on-2-and-4-legs.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'business': [{'title': 'Thanks to Wall St., There May Be Too Many Restaurants', 'text': ' PLAINFIELD, Ill. — The way Marcus Mooney saw it, he wasn’t just selling hot dogs — he was selling experiences. In addition to the classics — a cheese dog and a chili dog — his restaurant, Frank’s Night Out, served hot dogs topped with more exotic ingredients, like a \"Surf & Turf Dog\" featuring crumbles of garlic-basted Maine lobster. But the hot dog experiences Mr. Mooney offered were just one choice among hundreds for hungry motorists seeking a quick, inexpensive meal on this restaurant-laden stretch of Illinois Highway 59. His sales dropped. After opening his restaurant in 2013 and putting in seven-day work weeks, Mr. Mooney shuttered it last year. \"There becomes a point where there’s too many choices,\" Mr. Mooney said recently. \"The more restaurants that opened up, the more it took away from business for us.\" After a prolonged stretch of explosive growth, fueled by interest from Wall Street, experts say there are now too many fast-food, casual and other chain restaurants. Since the early 2000s, banks, private equity firms and other financial institutions have poured billions into the restaurant industry as they sought out more tangible enterprises than the dot-com start-ups that were going belly-up. There are now more than 620,000 eating and drinking places in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the number of restaurants is growing at about twice the rate of the population. That trend is evident on a more local level here in the sprawling suburbs southwest of Chicago, where the population is growing fast, but the number of restaurants is growing even faster. Twenty years ago, Mr. Mooney would have been competing against about 600 eateries in the region; by the end of last year, that number had more than doubled. \"Everybody thinks their brand has what it takes to succeed in the marketplace,\" said Victor Fernandez, an industry analyst with TDn2K, a Dallas-based firm that gathers data on the chain restaurant industry. \"You look at a location that looks good, but everybody is looking at the same place and they all come in, and the result is you get oversaturation.\" The glut of restaurants has increased the pressure on individual restaurant owners. Industry sales are up nationally, but growth has slowed to the lowest rate since 2010. Customers continue to spend a large share of their food budget in restaurants, but they’re spreading the money across a larger number of establishments, so profits are split into smaller individual pieces. Yet the industry — particularly chain restaurants — continues to expand, a strategy that both masks the problem and makes it likely that more places will falter. Sales at individual chain restaurants, compared with a year earlier, began dropping in early 2016, analysts reported. A majority of restaurants reported sales growth in just four of the last 22 monthly surveys from the National Restaurant Association. Before that, most restaurants had reported growth for 20 consecutive months, from March 2014 through October 2015, the survey found. As Americans work longer hours and confront an ever-growing array of food options, they are spending a growing share of their food budget — about 44 cents per dollar — on restaurants, according to food economists at the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service. But while consumer demand contributed to the restaurant boom, it was changes on Wall Street that really fueled the explosion. Chains like Del Taco, Papa Murphy’s and others began attracting money from private equity firms, and banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw lending opportunities in the restaurant industry. Those developments complemented each other well. New fast-food investors wanted to rely less on owning restaurants, and offloaded many company locations to eager buyers who came with bags of cheap money from the banks. The investors could then count on a steady stream of franchise fees and royalty payments — buffers against overall sales declines if, say, the market ever became oversaturated. And they didn’t have to worry about actually operating the restaurants. Franchisees pay for the right to operate a McDonald’s or a Subway, following rules that dictate everything from what type of taco to sell to where to buy iceberg lettuce. They take on the risks and costs of running the restaurants, in exchange for the marketing muscle and name recognition these big companies provide. While every Dunkin’ Donuts or Taco Bell may look the same, dozens and sometimes hundreds of independent owners can operate most of the restaurants within a single brand. But some franchisees say they’re being pressured to open too many stores as food companies push for new revenue streams. Buying an existing restaurant, for example, may mean agreeing to build 10 new ones. \"They want us to sign aggressive development agreements,\" said Shoukat Dhanani, the chief executive officer of the Dhanani Group, which owns hundreds of Burger King and Popeyes restaurants. \"I didn’t see that even five years ago.\" The shuttering of restaurants could have a major impact on the labor market. Since 2010, restaurants have accounted for one out of every seven new jobs, and many restaurateurs complain that it has become increasingly difficult to hire and retain workers. In Muscogee County, Ga., a former textile center, the Labor Department reported an overall decline in employment of 2,000 jobs since 2001 — but a gain of 2,700 restaurant jobs. Those positions could be in jeopardy if sales continue to fall and force more restaurants to close. Over the summer, the parent company of Applebee’s announced it would close more than 100 locations. In 2016 Subway, the nation’s largest fast-food chain by location count, closed more locations than it opened, the first time in its history that had happened. \"Year over year, we are seeing chain restaurants grow at twice the rate of overall population growth,\" said Mr. Fernandez, the TDn2K analyst. \"We believe now there are probably too many restaurants and too many brands.\" In this business environment, restaurant owners are often risking their personal fortunes when they open a Pizza Hut or create their own idea for a restaurant, like Frank’s Night Out. Melissa Arcache also plowed her life savings into her dream of running a successful restaurant. She now owns three branches of Bahama Buck’s, an island-themed frozen dessert chain decorated with surfboards and novelty mileage signs listing the distance to Bermuda and the Bimini Islands, in the Houston area. Even before Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, Ms. Arcache was struggling. Sales in August were down 10 percent from last year, and business fell further after the storm. She looks at all of the competitors opening up shop nearby and wonders what she can do. She said she doesn’t have a Plan B. \"This is what we’re going to make work,\" Ms. Arcache said during an interview at her store in Houston, which was recently vandalized, leaving behind dents in the walls she has yet to patch up. \"This is what’s going to feed my future kids and hopefully get them through college,\" she said. Mr. Mooney also put his life savings into his restaurant, Frank’s Night Out, only to see it fail. His personal life suffered, too — he was married when Frank’s opened but divorced by the time it closed. He now works as head chef for a company that owns a brewery and restaurant in the same strip mall where Frank’s Night Out was located, and passes by his old restaurant on his way to work. Transformed into a beef and gyro shop, the new establishment sells one of the items he created, a hot dog wrapped in bacon and topped with macaroni and cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. It even has the same name — the \"Deep South Dog.\" At first, Mr. Mooney said, he felt relief when he looked in and saw few customers. \"It allows you to think that the failure of it was not you,\" he said. But nine months later he’s rooting for the new restaurant to succeed. \"Now it’s kind of like, oh, man, I’m glad people are going in,\" he said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/business/too-many-restaurants-wall-street.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Russian Influence Reached 126 Million Through Facebook Alone', 'text': ' WASHINGTON — Russian agents intending to sow discord among American citizens disseminated inflammatory posts that reached 126 million users on Facebook, published more than 131,000 messages on Twitter and uploaded over 1,000 videos to Google’s YouTube service, according to copies of prepared remarks from the companies that were obtained by The New York Times. The detailed disclosures, sent to Congress on Monday by companies whose products are among the most widely used on the internet, came before a series of congressional hearings this week into how third parties used social networks and online services to influence millions of Americans before the 2016 presidential election. The new information goes far beyond what the companies have revealed in the past and underline the breadth of the Kremlin’s efforts to lever open divisions in the United States using American technology platforms, especially Facebook. Multiple investigations of Russian meddling have loomed over the first 10 months of the Trump presidency, with one leading to the indictments of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chief, and others on Monday. In its prepared remarks sent to Congress, Facebook said the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy Russian company linked to the Kremlin, had posted roughly 80,000 pieces of divisive content that was shown to about 29 million people between January 2015 and August 2017. Those posts were then liked, shared and followed by others, spreading the messages to tens of millions more people. Facebook also said it had found and deleted more than 170 accounts on its photo-sharing app Instagram; those accounts had posted about 120,000 pieces of Russia-linked content. Previously, Facebook had said it identified more than $100,000 in advertisements paid for by the Internet Research Agency. The Russia-linked posts were \"an insidious attempt to drive people apart,\" Colin Stretch, the general counsel for Facebook who will appear at the hearings, said in his prepared remarks. He called the posts \"deeply disturbing,\" and noted they focused on race, religion, gun rights, and gay and transgender issues. Facebook, Mr. Stretch said, was \"determined to prevent it from happening again.\" The new information also illuminated when Facebook knew there had been Russian interference on its platform. Several times before the election last Nov. 8, Facebook said its security team discovered threats targeted at employees of the major American political parties from a group called APT28, an agency that United States law enforcement officials have previously linked to Russian military intelligence operations. Facebook cautioned that the Russia-linked posts represented a minuscule amount of content compared with the billions of posts that flow through users’ News Feeds everyday. Between 2015 and 2017, people in the United States saw more than 11 trillion posts from Pages on Facebook. Twitter, in its prepared remarks, said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts on its service that were linked to the Internet Research Agency between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts, which Twitter has suspended, posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period. Outside of the activity of the Internet Research Agency, Twitter identified more than 36,000 automated accounts that posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that three-month period. The tweets received approximately 288 million views, according to the company’s remarks. Twitter noted that the 1.4 million Russia-linked election tweets represented less than three-quarters of one percent of all election-related tweets during that period. Google, in its prepared statement, said it had also found evidence that the Internet Research Agency bought ads on its services and created YouTube channels to upload short videos about divisive social issues including law enforcement, race relations or Syria. Google said it had found 18 channels that were \"likely associated\" with the Russian agents that posted political videos to YouTube. All told, those accounts — now suspended — uploaded more than 1,100 videos totaling 43 hours of content from 2015 through the summer of 2017. Google said, in general, those videos had very low view counts that added up to 309,000 views between the middle of 2015 and late 2016. Only three percent of the videos had more than 5,000 views and there was no evidence that the accounts had targeted American viewers, the company said. The internet search giant also confirmed earlier reports that the Internet Research Agency had purchased search and display ads from it. Google said the group had bought $4,700 in ads but none of them had targeted users by their political leanings, which was a targeting tool that Google added before the election. Google had been investigating a separate $53,000 in ad purchases with political material from Russian internet or building addresses, but discovered that those were not related to the Kremlin. \"While we found only limited activity on our services, we will continue to work to prevent all of it, because no amount of interference is acceptable,\" wrote Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, and Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel. The two men were scheduled to testify at separate congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday. For Facebook, Google and Twitter, the discovery of Russian influence by way of their sites has been a rude awakening. The companies had long positioned themselves as spreading information and connecting people for positive ends. Now the companies must grapple with how Russian agents used their technologies exactly as they were meant to be used — but for malevolent purposes. That has led to thorny debates inside the companies. For Facebook, the problem is less straightforward than finding Russia-linked pages and taking down content. Executives worry about how stifling speech from non-American entities could set a precedent on the social network — and how it could potentially be used against other groups in the future. So Facebook has focused on the issue of authenticity — or the fact that the Russian agencies did not identify themselves as such — as a reason for taking down the accounts. \"Many of these ads did not violate our content policies,\" Elliot Schrage, vice president of policy and communications at Facebook, said in a company blog post earlier this month. \"That means that for most of them, if they had been run by authentic individuals, anywhere, they could have remained on the platform.\" Earlier this month, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner introduced a bipartisan bill to require internet companies to identify those who paid for political ads on the tech companies’ platforms. Facebook has been promoting its strengthened advertising disclosure policies as an attempt to pre-empt the bipartisan bill. Last week, Facebook began rolling out new features that provide insight into who is paying for ads, and it will maintain a publicly viewable database of ads purchased on the network. The company is also stepping up its counterintelligence and security measures. Facebook has said it is working with Twitter, Google and other companies to spot sophisticated threats earlier, and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement when appropriate. The company said it shuttered 5.8 million fake accounts in October 2016, and removed 30,000 accounts attempting to influence the French elections this year. Google also said it plans to increase its transparency for political ads. The company is working to issue an annual report about who is buying political ads and how much they are spending. The company also said it planned to create a publicly accessible database into what election ads ran on Google’s AdWords — for example, web search ads — and YouTube. Google said it will identify the advertisers paying for political ads within a link accessible from the ad. But Google said it did not intend to take any further action against state-backed Russian news channel RT, which has built a massive online audience through YouTube. The American intelligence community has described RT as the Kremlin’s \"principal international propaganda outlet\", but Google said the organization had not violated any of its policies or misused the service. Last week, by contrast, Twitter said it would ban RT and Sputnik, another Kremlin-backed news organization, from advertising on its service.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/facebook-google-russia.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Lennar Makes Deal for CalAtlantic as Home Builders Face Challenges', 'text': ' The home-building sector in the United States has faced an array of challenges, including natural disasters, a long-running labor shortage and increased regulatory costs. Now, two of the nation’s biggest residential-construction companies are merging in hopes that their combined heft will help them counter those forces. The Lennar Corporation said on Monday that it would merge with the CalAtlantic Group to form America’s largest home builder in a stock-and-cash deal worth $5.7 billion. The deal would create a behemoth with around 240,000 building plots in 21 states, a market value of about $18 billion and combined revenue of $17 billion over the past 12 months. Lennar and CalAtlantic anticipate reaping $250 million in annual cost savings and paying down debt obligations. But the deal will not alter a basic problem: The construction of new homes in the United States lags below historical averages. A decade after the big housing bust dealt a blow to many smaller home builders, the industry’s largest firms continue to grapple with higher regulatory expenses that make building homes — especially starter homes — too costly, some housing-finance experts said. The situation confounds some people, given the pressing need for affordable housing for young families. Laurie Goodman, a director of housing-finance policy for the Urban Institute, said the nation suffered from a \"huge supply shortage\" of new single-family homes. \"The underlying structural problem is we are not building enough homes and homes are costly to build,\" Ms. Goodman said. \"We all agree that more things should be handicapped accessible and new homes should be hurricane proof, but there is a cost associated.\" Right now, the home-building industry is dealing with a new cost: the impact of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the South and devastating wildfires in Northern California. New construction in the South fell 9.3 percent last month, largely because of the hurricanes. And housing starts across the country declined 4.7 percent to 1.127 million units in September, a low for the year. Eventually the damage caused by the hurricanes and fires in California could lead to a surge in construction in a handful of states. But finding the workers to build those homes could be a challenge. Six in 10 home builders had trouble attracting the right workers during the third quarter of the year, according to a survey published last month. Another 30 percent said they had moderate difficulty finding such workers. By merging, Lennar and CalAtlantic hope their size will help them achieve \"efficiencies in purchasing\" and gain \"access to land, labor and overhead allocation,\" Stuart Miller, Lennar’s chief executive, said in a news release. \"The combined company will have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow available to pay down debt and repurchase shares,\" Mr. Miller said. Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist with Trulia, an online residential real estate listing firm, said he hoped the merged companies would eventually use their heft to increase production of new homes. \"At face value, I was very excited to hear about this merger because inventory is hovering near historic lows, and that hurts home buyers and renters very hard,\" Mr. McLaughlin said. But, he said, he was then disappointed to learn that the intent, for now, \"was not to ramp up production but to gain efficiencies that will be used to pay down debt.\" Under the deal’s terms, CalAtlantic shareholders would receive 0.885 Lennar shares for each CalAtlantic share. That would equate to $51.34 a share, a 27 percent premium above CalAtlantic’s closing price on Friday. The transaction values CalAtlantic at $9.3 billion, including debt. CalAtlantic shareholders also have the option to take all or a portion of their shares in cash, at $48.26 a share. The cash payments would be limited to a total of $1.2 billion, Lennar said. On completion of the transaction, CalAtlantic shareholders are expected to own about 26 percent of the combined company. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to shareholder approval. Mr. Miller and his family trust, which hold a 41.4 percent voting interest in Lennar, and MP CA Homes, an affiliate of MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities Partners that holds a 25.4 percent voting interest in CalAtlantic, have agreed to support the deal, the companies said. Citigroup and the law firm Goodwin Procter advised Lennar; J. P. Morgan and the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher advised CalAtlantic.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/business/dealbook/lennar-croporation-calatlantic-group.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Akzo Nobel in Talks to Merge Paints Business with Axalta', 'text': ' LONDON — The Dutch company Akzo Nobel said on Monday that it was in talks to create a paints industry giant, just months after it repeatedly rebuffed takeover approaches from an American rival, PPG Industries. Akzo Nobel’s discussions to combine its paints business with another rival, Axalta Coating Systems, come with the Dutch company also planning to spin off its specialty chemicals business. Akzo Nobel — which counts Dulux paint among its brands — said those spinoff plans would be unaffected by the discussions with Axalta. The specialty chemicals business had 4.8 billion euros, or about $5.6 billion, in revenue last year. Akzo Nobel, with a market value of about $22 billion, is much larger than Axalta, at $8.1 billion. Spinning off the specialty chemicals business, however, would probably make the two companies closer in size. Akzo Nobel and Axalta said the deal would be a so-called merger of equals. Axalta, based in Philadelphia, makes automobile paints and coatings for auto parts. The company reported net sales of $4.1 billion last year and employs about 13,000 people. The Carlyle Group, an investment firm, acquired Axalta from DuPont for $4.9 billion in 2012 and publicly listed the company the next year. Akzo Nobel fought off a series of takeover approaches from PPG this year. PPG abandoned its pursuit in June. PPG Industries first approached Akzo Nobel about a combination in March, but the Dutch company rejected that offer and two subsequent ones. PPG’s last offer valued the company at $26.4 billion. The repeated rejections sparked a dispute with Elliott Management, an American hedge fund founded by the billionaire Paul E. Singer. Elliott urged Akzo Nobel to engage in talks with PPG, and the fund eventually went to court to try to force a shareholder meeting aimed at replacing Akzo Nobel’s chairman, Antony Burgmans. Mr. Burgmans said in July that he intends to retire next year. That announcement came just days after Akzo Nobel’s chief executive, Ton Büchner, had said he was stepping down immediately for health reasons. Akzo Nobel and Elliott finally reached a truce in August. Akzo Nobel said at the time that Elliott would suspend all litigation for three months, in the hope of \"normalizing the relationship with its shareholders.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/business/dealbook/akzo-nobel-axalta.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'In Self-Driving Race, Waymo Sets Its Own Terms', 'text': ' ATWATER, Calif. — A self-driving car is not a self-driving car is not a self-driving car. That is the message Waymo, the autonomous vehicle division of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, tried to send on Monday, when it invited a group of reporters to visit Castle, a facility in California’s Central Valley that it has been using as a training course for its self-driving vehicles. Castle, which is built on a decommissioned Air Force base roughly 120 miles from San Francisco, resembles a miniature city, with many of the realistic elements a self-driving car might encounter on the road — like cul-de-sacs, traffic signals and a smattering of potholes. Waymo has been putting its test vehicles through their paces here since 2013, and conducting some 20,000 tests of different road situations. And on Monday, the company was offering rides in its latest prototype, a Chrysler Pacifica minivan outfitted with a cluster of sensors and cameras. But first, John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive, wanted to give a vocabulary lesson. \"Let’s talk about self-driving,\" he said. \"There’s a lot of confusion about what the terminology means.\" He rattled off a list of terms that have been used to describe vehicles with varying levels of self-driving ability: autonomous, driverless, semiautonomous, fully self-driving, partially autonomous, semi-driverless. \"It’s really a bit of a problem, isn’t it?\" he said. If Mr. Krafcik seems annoyed, it’s because the self-driving hype cycle is running at full volume these days, with companies from Uber to General Motors to Tesla noisily promoting their progress toward autonomous vehicles. It’s hard to know where this all ends. Will the winner be the company that develops a vehicle capable of driving along a preprogrammed route, in ideal weather conditions, in certain cities? Or will it be the vehicle that can drive itself anywhere, rain or snow? Is it enough to build a vehicle that drives itself most of the time, or is a truly driverless car one in which the passenger can safely take a nap? Does it count if a company produces just a handful of expensive prototype vehicles, rather than something that can be mass-produced and sold by the tens of thousands? Waymo has set a narrow target. It is aiming for Level 4 autonomy, an official classification for a vehicle that is capable of driving itself, with no human behind the wheel, in most environments and road conditions. It believes that nothing short of Level 4 counts as autonomous, and that bypassing Level 3 (a lower classification, in which some human attention is still required) is necessary to keep people safe on the roads. Humans, the company says, can easily lose concentration while driving with Level 3 autonomy, even though they often need to take over at a moment’s notice. That is also a self-serving goal. By most estimations, Waymo is closer than any other company to Level 4 autonomy. Its test vehicles, which have been on the road for eight years, have completed more than 3.5 million autonomous miles, far more than any of its competitors. It has driven another 2.5 billion miles in \"Carcraft,\" a simulated, virtual-reality environment that allows the company to run and rerun various situations millions of times a day, and incorporate the results into its real-world vehicles. And its access to Google’s top-tier engineering talent and cutting-edge technical infrastructure has made it a formidable competitor. Waymo’s advantage was apparent on Monday, during my test ride in the company’s self-driving minivan. Unlike other driverless demos I’ve encountered, there was no human keeping watch at the wheel. To start the trip, a colleague in the back seat pressed a large blue button marked \"start ride,\" and the van took off on its own. In a 10-minute drive around Castle, it easily handled a series of different on-road situations and obstacles. It encircled a roundabout, waited patiently for pedestrians to cross the street, and dodged traffic cones and bicyclists with ease. It felt slick and polished, and gave the sense that it might be ready for public consumption very soon. Granted, this was a carefully planned test loop in a controlled environment. Autonomous driving on public roads is a much harder challenge, and Waymo is still figuring out how best to deploy its technology to a wider market. The company declined to put a date on when it might release self-driving cars to the general public, and Mr. Krafcik spoke only in generalities about its plans, saying that it would focus on ride-hailing and autonomous trucking as possible early business models. \"We’re really close,\" he said. But Waymo’s road to autonomy has not been entirely smooth. It has lost some engineering talent to well-funded competitors. Its executives have been distracted by a prominent lawsuit against Uber, in which Waymo accused Uber of stealing trade secrets worth more than $2 billion. And in an early-access test program in Phoenix, its vehicles reportedly struggled to make left turns, one of many real-world obstacles that have to be overcome. And the competition is heating up. Lyft and Drive.ai, a self-driving car start-up, are teaming up to offer a pilot program for driverless ride-hailing in San Francisco. Uber has been developing its own driverless fleet, and it is testing vehicles on public roads in Arizona, Pittsburgh and Toronto. Detroit is getting up to speed, too — General Motors, which spent $1 billion to acquire Cruise Automation last year, recently announced that it has a production-ready autonomous vehicle, once the software and regulatory kinks are worked out, and Ford, which has partnered with Argo AI, an artificial intelligence company based in Pittsburgh, plans to put Level 4 autonomous vehicles on the road by 2021. Waymo’s victory against this army of well-funded competitors is not guaranteed. But it won’t be easy to beat, especially if it gets to define what winning means.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/technology/driverless-cars-waymo.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'As Apple and Facebook Chiefs Visit, Xi Jinping Vows Deeper Reform', 'text': ' SHANGHAI — Just days after being likened to a king by President Trump, President Xi Jinping of China on Monday reiterated his commitment to reform while holding court before a group of wealthy and influential business leaders from his country and the United States. Mr. Xi, speaking at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing during an event shown on national television, addressed topics such as globalization, innovation and China’s relationship with the United States at a gathering of executives who included Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple; Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group; and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive. The reception was one of Mr. Xi’s first public appearances with foreign visitors since a key Chinese Communist Party congress elevated him to the same exalted status as Mao Zedong, the country’s founding father, and Deng Xiaoping, who led the country from 1978 until 1989. The event — just a week before Mr. Trump is scheduled to make his first visit to China — was most likely arranged to signal China’s status as an economic superpower and peer of the United States. Chinese diplomats have used past business summits to promote their country’s economic clout and influence with American companies before testier meetings with United States leaders and diplomats. On a 2015 trip to the United States, for example, Mr. Xi stopped in Seattle to visit American technology executives before going to Washington to meet with President Barack Obama. On Monday, Mr. Xi used his remarks to promote his credentials as a leader following Deng’s footsteps as an economic reformer and defender of global trade. \"China is advancing comprehensive deepening of reform with unprecedented determination and vigor,\" he said, according to a summary of his comments issued by Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. He added that \"China has and will continue issuing a series of measures to further open up.\" Mr. Xi’s professed his commitment to economic openness and reform nearly 10 days after he opened a Communist Party congress that confirmed him as China’s leader for five more years. The congress also endorsed his vision, laid out in a work report, of a nation firmly in the party’s grip and dedicated to reclaiming a central place on the international stage. International investors and business groups have grown increasingly skeptical about Mr. Xi’s commitment to opening up the Chinese economy. The Chinese government, citing worries that foreign technology and companies could compromise the country’s security, has fed those doubts by tightening restrictions over the internet and advanced technology. And even as Mr. Xi reiterated his commitment to reform, he emphasized that China’s sovereignty and security were of paramount importance. \"China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and developmental interests, and at the same time adhere to a fundamental national policy of opening up,\" he said. In a further move in that direction, the Chinese government on Monday announced new rules meant to restrict online journalism, including a blacklist for erring journalists. For the executives attending the event on Monday, the restrictions are hitting the bottom line. Facebook remains mostly blocked in China despite the company’s lobbying efforts. Apple said this year that it would build a data center in the country to conform with a new Chinese cybersecurity law. The moves by Beijing have prompted calls in Washington for added scrutiny of Chinese companies seeking to do business in the United States or buy up American technology companies. Such issues are unlikely to be addressed in the coming meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, experts said. Mr. Xi’s appeal to the executives on Monday in some ways contrasted with Mr. Trump’s clashes with the leaders of some American tech companies. Other executives attending the event included Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive; Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank; Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary; Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba; Pony Ma, Tencent’s chief executive; and Terry Guo, the chief executive of Foxconn.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/business/xi-jinping-american-executives.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Tipping May Be the Norm, but Not for Hotel Housekeepers', 'text': ' The tip doesn’t have to be big — $1 to $5, says the American Hotel and Lodging Association. But fewer than a third of hotel guests leave any money for the housekeepers. The hotel association publishes a gratuity guide on its website that offers suggestions for tipping everyone from valet attendants to bellhops. But why are housekeepers often forgotten? A common explanation is that they are out of sight and, therefore, out of mind — that travelers are likely to tip only employees they directly interact with. But another cause may be a simple lack of awareness. \"As a general rule, people just don’t know they’re supposed to tip,\" said Shane C. Blum, an associate professor of hospitality and retail management at Texas Tech University. The setting, he said, compounds the problem. \"Obviously, when you’re with a group of people, like at a restaurant, there’s social pressure to tip. In a hotel room, you’re usually by yourself and there’s not that social pressure.\" But even when guests are nudged to leave tips for the housekeepers, it doesn’t always work. In 2014, two longtime housekeepers at the JW Marriott Santa Monica Le Merigot recalled, guests were regularly leaving cash tips when they checked out of their rooms, a result of the hotel chain taking part in \"The Envelope Please,\" an initiative started by the nonprofit group A Woman’s Nation to make it easier for customers to show appreciation to housekeepers. Envelopes were placed in 160,000 Marriott-managed hotel rooms in the United States and Canada meant to be filled with notes and tips for cleaners. Within a few weeks, though, the envelopes vanished. \"We heard that some guests felt the hotel was demanding tips for us,\" Blanca Guerrero, a housekeeper at the Santa Monica Marriott, said through a translator. Tipping norms, or the lack of them, may be especially unfair to housekeepers, who arguably do more for guests than park their cars or push the cart containing their dinners. Angela Lemus, a housekeeper at the Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill who makes $19.91 per hour, said through a translator that in addition to scrubbing tubs and taking out trash, she sometimes has to clean blood or other medical waste from rooms. Ms. Guerrero and another housekeeper at the Santa Monica Marriott, Aurelia Gonzalez, who make $15.66 an hour, said their responsibilities include cleaning not just the inside of rooms but also the balconies attached to them. Most housekeeping workers are women, a disproportionate number of them minorities and immigrants, according to Unite Here!, a labor union that represents thousands of hotel housekeepers in North America. Ms. Gonzalez was born in Mexico, and Ms. Guerrero in El Salvador. Though their wages are above the median hourly wage of $11.37 for hotel housekeepers reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2016, the profession’s earnings are less than the pay for housekeepers in other industries, like hospitals ($12.74 per the Bureau of Labor Statistics). Pay rates vary widely by region. Wage Watch, a company that tracks wage and salary information for the lodging and gambling industries, found that a housekeeper in a New York City hotel can expect to make an average of $29.41 an hour, while one in Charlotte, N.C., may earn an average of $10 an hour. Nationally, housekeepers’ wages are comparable to desk clerks’, whose average hourly rate the Bureau of Labor Statistics tallies at $11.28. But desk clerk jobs don’t require the flipping of heavy mattresses or exposure to cleaning chemicals that can lead to respiratory and other health problems. Ms. Lemus, for example, developed an allergy to the latex gloves she was required to wear while cleaning. \"It went on for years, and it got so bad my hands started to bleed,\" she said. \"I couldn’t let people see my hands.\" Yet housekeepers say that, without the gentle nudge of initiatives like \"The Envelope Please,\" only about 30 percent of guests leave a tip — a figure Professor Blum found as well. \"Some days someone will leave $5; other days, they leave nothing,\" Ms. Lemus said. \"Sometimes we get $2 or $3 in a room, and we get very happy,\" Ms. Guerrero said. \"It makes us feel like someone appreciated us.\" But sometimes, several days pass without a tip. Carmen Cruz, the manager of the four-diamond, 64-room Casa Madrona Hotel and Spa in Sausalito, Calif., said tipping trends in hotels are changing. \"Millennials travel a lot, and they’re not big tippers,\" she said. \"It’s because they’re independent, and they like to do everything themselves. They’re not looking for those extra services that an older couple may be, like, ‘Here, take my luggage.’\" Contrary to the situation in other hotels, housekeepers are among the most frequently tipped employees at the Casa Madrona, Ms. Cruz said. In addition to cultural background — Americans tend to tip more than European and Asian guests — length of stay is often a predictor of whether a maid will be tipped. \"If it’s a stay of more than a week, 90 percent of the time they’re going to leave a tip for our ladies,\" Ms. Cruz said. \"If it’s a one-night stay, 90 percent of the time they won’t leave a tip.\" But said she would never push guests, even those who have booked an extended stay, to leave tips for Casa Madrona’s housekeepers. \"We do leave stationery and envelopes in the room for when you want to write a letter, but we don’t want people to feel forced,\" she said. \"If they want to leave a tip, it should be from the heart.\" Marriott quickly came to that same conclusion after working with \"The Envelope Please.\" Connie Kim, a Marriott spokeswoman, said the initiative was scrapped within a few months because \"it just wasn’t popular.\" (An internet outcry, including an article on fortune.com with the headline \"Marriott to hotel guests: Please pay our maids for us,\" may have been a contributor.) But the idea that it is bad form for hotels to encourage the tipping of maids ought to be reconsidered, Professor Blum said. In 2016, one of his doctoral students conducted an experiment similar to \"The Envelope Please\" at a hotel in Lubbock, Tex. In addition to a larger percentage of tippers, the envelopes left in rooms, which made mention of the hotel association guidelines, yielded a flurry of thank yous from guests. \"People would write things like, ‘Thanks for your hard work,’\" Professor Blum said. \"You got the sense that knowing the guidelines was helpful to them.\" Still, that is not always the case. Michael Lynn, a professor of consumer behavior and marketing at Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration who has studied tipping extensively, is well aware of the guidelines. \"Tipping etiquette experts have said for 20 years or more that you should tip hotel maids. But even I don’t do it all the time,\" he said. \"Half the time I don’t have the proper change in my pocket or I forget.\" Both professors recommended a remedy for such cases, which would also work for business travelers who don’t tip because they are unsure they will be reimbursed without documentation of the cash outlay. \"If hotels really wanted to institutionalize tipping, they could do it through electronic checkouts, or an app, or the TV, with a question like, ‘Would you like to leave a tip for your housekeeper?’\" Professor Blum said. \"We live in a tipping society. Even sandwich shops do that now. Why shouldn’t hotels do it?\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/business/hotel-housekeeper-tipping.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The iPhone X Arrives Friday. Here’s What You Need to Know.', 'text': ' Apple’s iPhone X, the most anticipated iPhone since the original debuted a decade ago, is set to arrive in stores Friday. But unlike past releases, this iPhone may be extra hard to get — and it might not even be right for you. With a starting price of $999, the iPhone X is Apple’s first premium-tier iPhone. Its higher price and cutting-edge features skew the device toward early adopters and technology enthusiasts with disposable income. And because of reports about supply constraints, some analysts predict that many iPhone X orders may not be fulfilled until next year. So should you even bother trying to buy one? Here’s what you need to know about the premium iPhone. Apple opened online orders for the new iPhone last Friday. Just hours after it began taking orders, the website began quoting a shipping time of roughly five to six weeks. In other words, your best bet to get an iPhone X right away is to line up at a retail store on Friday. In a statement, Apple encouraged customers to arrive early — its stores open at 8 a.m. You could also try your luck at a third-party store, like your carrier or Best Buy, though third-party stores tend to carry fewer units. Apple is selling the iPhone X with two options for storage capacity: 64 gigabytes for $999 and 256 gigabytes for $1,149. There are various ways to pay that hefty price. The simplest route is to pay for the device outright. This is the least confusing option because your wireless bill will contain charges only for your phone plan, and you can do whatever you want with the device — like sell it or switch to a different wireless carrier — whenever you want. You can also opt to spread out the payments with a monthly installment plan. For example, if you are a Verizon customer, you can choose to pay off the $999 iPhone over 24 months for $41.62 a month. This is a nice option because spreading out the payments does not incur interest fees. Another option is to go for an early upgrade plan, which lets you pay a flat monthly rate and upgrade to a new iPhone annually. It’s essentially leasing a new phone every year. There are various early upgrade plans on the market. With Apple’s early upgrade program, you can pay $49.91 a month, and once you’ve made 12 payments, you can trade in your iPhone to upgrade to the next one and continue paying that monthly rate. (I’m not a fan of this path because I suggest cherishing your devices for as long as you can before upgrading.) Before you splurge, consider your options. Apple’s iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which share many features of the iPhone X, have starting prices of $699 and $799. The cheaper iPhones have the same computing processor as the iPhone X, so they are just as fast, and their 12-megapixel rear cameras are on a par with the rear camera on the iPhone X. So what’s the difference? Mainly, the screen. ■The iPhone X has a 5.8-inch screen that takes up the entire face of the device, with the exception of a notch at the top containing an infrared camera system. ■The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, and the iPhone 8 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen. Both of the cheaper iPhones have bezels — the border surrounding the display — whereas the iPhone X has eliminated the bezel. Other than screen size, the screen technologies differ. The iPhone X is the only Apple phone that uses OLED, a type of display that can be made thinner, lighter and brighter, and with better color accuracy and contrast than its predecessor, LCD. So the screen on the iPhone X looks more vibrant than the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8, which still use LCD. Last but not least, the iPhone X has a unique infrared face scanner. The technology, called Face ID, uses the infrared camera system on the front of the phone to scan the contours and shape of a person’s head to unlock the device and authorize mobile payments. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have normal front-facing cameras for snapping selfies. The primary way you can unlock an iPhone X is with the face scanner. The premium phone lacks Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor that has been a popular feature on iPhones for several years. Face ID is brand new — there hasn’t been anything like it on a smartphone before. It works by spraying an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. The imaging system can stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it. Because the shape of a person’s head is unique, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with someone else’s face is one in a million, according to Apple. Older facial recognition systems worked by using the camera to take a photo of yourself and comparing that with an image that was stored on the device. All a thief would need to do to fool the system was hold a photo of your face in front of the camera — which some people already did with Samsung’s facial-recognition feature. The false acceptance rate of older face recognition systems was one in 100. It will be interesting to see how early adopters react to Face ID, and whether it will work well with many different kinds of faces. If you’re skeptical or turned off by the idea of your phone constantly scanning your face to unlock your phone, you could always get an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus, which still have Touch ID.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/technology/personaltech/iphone-x-what-to-know.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'sports': [{'title': 'Baseball, Hot Dogs and Apple Pie.

Team employees do their best to prevent damage from the merriment by covering the walls and floors of clubhouses with plastic sheeting or disposable carpeting. It will still be messy and wild. What other workplace is like this? \"All of this is so silly anyway,\" observed Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy. \"We’re all wearing costumes to go out and play in the grass. None of this that happens here makes any sense, so it only makes sense that we celebrate in a way that doesn’t.\" As Major League Baseball’s postseason is nearing the biggest celebration of all — the Houston Astros need one more victory to win the World Series, the Dodgers need two — it seems appropriate to ask: Where does this ritual come from? \"Great question, but I have no idea,\" said Cubs reliever Pedro Strop, who celebrated a lot last year when his team snapped a 108-year drought and finally won the Series. He was speaking during a slippery and sticky moment this month after the Cubs beat the Washington Nationals in a five-game division series. \"It’s been like this for years,’’ he added. \"It’s actually really fun. It’s like it’s raining and you’re running around to avoid getting wet.\" Few, if any, sports seem to celebrate achievements as much as baseball teams do. In the other major professional sports leagues in North America, teams do not usually pop the corks until they win an actual championship. But that may be because other major sports do not play nearly as many games as baseball teams do. The 162-game regular season in baseball is twice as voluminous as the seasons in the N.B.A. and the N.H.L., and has about 10 times as many games as the N.F.L. season. So if a team clinches a playoff spot during the season — even if it is just the right to play in the win-or-go-home wild-card game — it is usually reason enough to break open the champagne and beer. \"I always think it’s silly to do it celebrating a division or getting the wild card,\" McCarthy said. \"But then I thought about that. You might never get back there. If that’s the only time when you’re first up, why not?\" If a major league team clinches a wild-card spot, wins the wild-card game, captures a division series and the league championship series, and then prevails in the World Series, that means five raucous, alcohol-filled celebrations in perhaps five or six weeks’ time. Four of them could occur within the span of three weeks in the postseason. \"It’s extreme to go from nothing to four celebrations if you win,\" said Los Angeles outfielder Curtis Granderson, who has reached the World Series three times in his career — with the Dodgers, Tigers and Mets. \"It’s always been interesting to me.\" Baseball championship celebrations involving champagne and beer have their roots in amateur baseball, dating back to the 19th century, according to research by John Thorn, the official historian of Major League Baseball. In the 20th century, there are instances of rambunctious festivities that go back to at least the 1940s. One involved the Brooklyn Dodgers, who in 1941 won their first National League pennant in 21 years. The clinching victory came against the Braves in Boston. Afterward, Larry McPhail, the Dodgers’ president, arranged for champagne to be stocked on the train for the team’s ride back to New York. By the time the train reached its destination, \"the Dodgers were hilarious and the train was a wreck,\" according to a newspaper account of their arrival. One of the Dodgers’ coaches, Chuck Dressen, had his shirt ripped off in the merriment, the article said. Two players, Pee Wee Reese and Pete Reiser, \"prowled up and down the aisles squirting everybody with champagne.\" Alcohol was also part of the postgame celebration after the legendary home run that Bobby Thomson hit in 1951 to allow the New York Giants to snatch the pennant from the Dodgers. And after the Dodgers won the 1956 N.L. pennant, their celebration was described as such in The New York Times: \"Beer and champagne were being poured over the heads and into the hip pockets of those who still had uniforms on.\" The celebrations have continued since then, but with various twists. Many players now use goggles, regardless of what Kershaw thinks. Not surprisingly, the New Era Cap Company, which makes the official caps for Major League Baseball, is now in the goggle business, too. One goggle-wearer is Josh Reddick, the Astros’ right fielder, who is notorious for his champagne-drenched reveling while wearing only stars-and-stripes briefs. He does not care if he looks ridiculous. \"I love it,\" he said in an interview last week. \"For as long as I can remember, this is the way it’s been, so that’s what I’m accustomed to and I’ve gotten used to. So I don’t look at it from that perspective, like it being awkward, but it’s just what I’ve known and look forward to as a player.\" Major League Baseball has tried to curb over-the-top celebrations with periodic guidelines concerning such things as the quantity of alcohol available or transportation provided for players and staff. Some players and baseball executives acknowledge they have not really thought about alternative ways to whoop it up. Karim Garcia, a retired outfielder from Mexico who spent parts of 10 seasons in the major leagues, said he was surprised when he first took part in a division-clinching celebration with the Dodgers in 1995. As it does now, most of the alcohol, including some expensive champagne, ended up on the floor or sprayed on the ceiling, and went unconsumed. \"It was a great experience, and then you realize: ‘Why are you spraying and wasting it? Better to drink it,’\" he said. \"We probably should have just sprayed beer. It’s just one of those traditions that’s been around awhile and you just follow it. I think it’s the only place that we do it like this.\" After winning titles in Mexican League baseball, Garcia said, his teams celebrated only with beer because it was cheaper. Astros reliever Tyler Clippard, a veteran of 11 major league seasons, said: \"It is weird. But what else would you do? In the Indy 500, they drink milk. That’s way weirder. What should you do? Spray orange juice?\" Farhan Zaidi, the Dodgers’ general manager, said spraying so much beer and champagne was probably not the \"greatest bang-for-the-buck expense that we have as an organization, but it’s a tradition and this sport is full of it.\" \"If the celebration for winning different rounds of the playoffs was an elaborate high five, that’s what everybody would do and then go home,\" he added. \"It’s just what people have always done. But if aliens landed from another planet and saw this, they would think it was pretty bizarre.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/sports/baseball/world-series-champagne-beer.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Anything Can Happen in Baseball, and Most of It Did in Game 5', 'text': ' HOUSTON — The flatbed cart hauling the equipment bags of the Los Angeles Dodgers zipped sharply through the field-level corridors of Minute Maid Park early Monday morning. The driver was in a hurry, and why not? The Dodgers had just blown three leads to the Houston Astros in one of the most frenzied games in World Series history. Home never looked so inviting. In his haste, though, the driver plowed right into an armchair jutting out near a lobby, in full view of Jim Crane, the Astros’ owner. This could be trouble. \"That’s all right,\" said Crane, who made his fortune in the freight business and understands the hazards. \"We can buy some new furniture.\" Crane was in a forgiving mood. He bought the Astros in 2011, when they were the worst team in the major leagues. Now they are one victory away from a championship, after surviving — there is no other word — a 13-12 odyssey in Game 5. The two sides bashed seven home runs and needed 5 hours 17 minutes to finish in 10 innings. \"Listen, you never expect a game like that,\" Crane said. \"That was just an incredible game. I had people texting me, ‘Jim, whoever wins, this is the best game I’ve ever seen!’ You want to be on top, of course. But it’s just incredible for the fans and the city.\" In the 657 World Series games that came before, only one had more total runs. Only one had more homers. Only one lasted longer. And none, perhaps, served onlookers with such a dizzying cocktail of enchantment and debauchery. The Astros and their fans have yearned for a moment like this. Founded in 1962, the franchise has never won the World Series and has made it only once before, in 2005, when it was host to a 5-hour-41-minute, 14-inning loss to the Chicago White Sox that was part of a four-game sweep. Twice in the 1980s, the Astros lost the final game of the National League Championship Series at home, in extra innings, as the visitors left town with a pennant. Now, it seems, the Astros have learned to play the modern game better than anyone else. In a major league season that included more home runs than ever before, the Astros led all teams in slugging percentage — while also having the fewest strikeouts. In that way, Game 5 was their masterpiece. The Astros got homers from Yuli Gurriel, Jose Altuve, George Springer, Carlos Correa and Brian McCann, and fanned just six times in 47 trips to the plate. The final batted ball was a two-out single to left by Alex Bregman off the Dodgers’ Kenley Jansen. Derek Fisher, a rookie pinch-runner, had been inserted just before that pitch for the first time in the series. He dashed home from second, slid his orange spikes across the plate, ahead of the throw, and popped up to embrace McCann, the veteran who had told him he would do something special. \"You never know when your time’s going to be, but you’re going to have a time,\" Fisher said McCann had promised him. \"And it’s going to be an important time.\" For the winning run to score on such a play — a first-pitch line drive, a two-base sprint and a smooth final slide — was oddly reassuring. Most of what came before was another home run derby, the second of the series. In Game 2 at Dodger Stadium last week, the teams combined for a record eight homers in a comeback victory for the Astros, by 7-6, in 11 innings. \"I didn’t think that would ever be topped,\" said Bregman, who debuted in the majors last year. \"I thought that would be the best game I ever played in my career. Who knows where this one ranks? Right up there with that game.\" The teams have combined for 22 homers in five games, breaking the World Series record of 21 set in seven games in 2002, the last year before baseball began testing for steroids. One theory for the new power surge is that hitters have learned to tailor their swings to launch more fly balls, reasoning that fly balls produce more runs than grounders. Many pitchers, though, suspect the balls are juiced because baseball wants more offense, as the Astros’ Dallas Keuchel asserted after the Game 2 slugfest. Before Sunday’s game, another Astros pitcher, Justin Verlander, told a roomful of reporters that the balls for this World Series were slicker, making them harder to grip and leading to erratic location. McCann — who hit last in the Astros’ lineup on Sunday despite 12 seasons as one of the best slugging catchers in baseball — gave a more nuanced explanation. \"Neither team was swinging out of the strike zone,\" he said. \"It’s really impressive. Both teams are having amazing at-bats. You play a team for seven games, you start seeing tendencies back and forth.\" Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers’ ace, had held the Astros to one run in seven innings of the Series opener, striking out 11 with no walks. This time, after facing the minimum number of batters through three innings, Kershaw lost command and the 4-0 lead his hitters had built against Keuchel. He could not complete the fifth. \"I don’t really pay attention to it,\" Kershaw said when asked about a possible change in the baseballs. \"I just assume that both sides are dealing with it, so I’m not going to worry about it.\" Jansen, who blew the save in Game 2, allowed a homer in Game 4 and lost Game 5, gave a similarly cagey response when asked about the ball. \"Something funny with it,\" he said. \"This is my eighth season in the big leagues. I have my thoughts; I’ll keep them to myself.\" Major league officials, naturally, insist that the balls conform to specifications, and that the only difference is the gold color of the printing stamped to them. Whatever the reason — the balls, the hitters, the heat in Los Angeles, the inviting left-field porch in Houston, something else — home runs are soaring. \"All these hitters are so good, it’s just amazing,\" Crane said. \"Any guy who gets up can hit it out of the ballpark, on either team, almost. I went into the commissioner’s box, we had a three-run lead and I was feeling pretty good. But I said, ‘It’s not over.’\" It was not over until Bregman delivered the game’s 25th run, a total matched in a 1997 World Series game but eclipsed only in Game 4 in 1993, when Toronto beat Philadelphia, 15-14. That game, at least, had a late oasis of shutdown pitching by Toronto relievers. Here, nearly all of the 14 pitchers seemed helpless. \"I’m sure everybody’s pretty exhausted after that,\" Kershaw said. \"Emotionally and physically.\" That was true, said Cody Bellinger, the Dodgers’ rookie first baseman, who homered and tripled in Game 5. But Bellinger, 22, could also frame it within a larger backdrop. \"That was pure entertainment,\" Bellinger said, adding later: \"Anything can happen. That’s why sports are so great, the unexpected. I don’t think anybody expected this.\" In a way, the spirit of that comment echoed the one Cincinnati’s Pete Rose made to Carlton Fisk at Fenway Park in Boston during Game 6 of the 1975 World Series. When he came to bat in the 11th inning, Rose told Fisk, the Red Sox’ catcher, \"Isn’t this the most exciting game you ever played in?\" The next inning, Fisk homered to win it for the Red Sox, who survived to play a Game 7 — won by the Reds on a single in the ninth inning. In that 1975 World Series, considered perhaps the finest ever played, the home team won Games 1, 3 and 5, while losing Games 2 and 4. That precise pattern has held up in only one other World Series in history: this one. In 1975, the Red Sox won Game 1 in Boston, but lost Game 2. When the series shifted to Cincinnati, the Reds won Game 3, lost Game 4 and won Game 5 — setting up the sublime sixth and seventh games. Likewise, in this World Series, the Dodgers took Game 1 in Los Angeles, but the Astros won Game 2. When the series shifted to Houston, the Astros won Game 3, lost Game 4 and won Game 5. With a championship in reach on Tuesday, the Astros will send Verlander to the mound at Dodger Stadium for Game 6. \"This is not going to be finished Tuesday,\" the Dodgers’ Yasiel Puig vowed. \"There’s going to be a Game 7.\" For a series this intoxicating, we should all be so lucky.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/sports/baseball/world-series-houston-astros-los-angeles-dodgers-game-5.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Carson Wentz Is Fueling Eagles’ Hype. Not That He’s Noticed.', 'text': ' PHILADELPHIA — Carson Wentz ate lunch last year with the former N.F.L. quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. As they talked, Hasselbeck, now an analyst for ESPN, wondered whether Wentz knew everything he had said about him — good or bad — on television. Then Wentz asked Hasselbeck what he’d been doing since retiring. \"I tell him, and then he goes, ‘What channel is that?’\" Hasselbeck said. \"‘Oh, ESPN,’ I say. And then I’m like, ‘He really doesn’t know.’\" Hasselbeck recounted that story over the phone last week, a few days before Wentz guided the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday to their sixth consecutive victory, to emphasize what he considers Wentz’s finest quality, one that is becoming ever more relevant. The Eagles, at 7-1, have the best record in the league, and also their best through eight games since 2004, when they last reached the Super Bowl. Even though it has been a while since they actually won the Super Bowl — as in, never — fans have reacted to the Eagles’ success with nothing but restraint and levelheaded calm. No one here has anointed Wentz as an amalgam of Andrew Luck and Brett Favre, or petitioned to rename the state as Wentzylvania, or pricing flights to Minneapolis — site of a certain big game that rhymes with Grouper Roll — for early February. Nah, nothing like that. Witness the power of Wentz, whose development in his second season has accelerated the Eagles’ revival. His obliviousness — to the mounting attention, not just Hasselbeck’s second act in broadcasting — is what can sustain it. \"I don’t want to say robotic,\" right tackle Lane Johnson said, \"but he’s just consistent — really, really consistent.\" Before Sunday, when Philadelphia kept the San Francisco 49ers winless by bludgeoning them, 33-10, under steady rain at Lincoln Financial Field, Wentz had thrown at least three touchdown passes in each of his last three games. He mustered only two in what he called a sluggish performance against San Francisco, running his season total to 19, staying on pace to shatter the franchise’s season record of 32. Sonny Jurgensen set the mark in 1961, and the Eagles have had some pretty fair quarterbacks since then: Ron Jaworski, Randall Cunningham and, best of them all, Donovan McNabb, who in his prime — with rare exceptions — afforded the Eagles at least one certainty heading into every game: that they would have the advantage at quarterback. Wentz has not earned that distinction yet, but the Eagles are enamored with how quickly he seems to be getting there. In truth, they are enamored with most things now, from their win-loss record to their red-zone efficiency (68 percent) to their ferocious defense, which sacked 49ers quarterback C. J. Beathard four times, hit him 12 more, and also forced a three-and-out or a turnover on eight of San Francisco’s 14 possessions. On one of those takeaways, Jalen Mills returned an interception 37 yards for a touchdown. \"If you’re enjoying your first real dominant season as a team, no one’s going to show up on Sunday and take it for granted,\" defensive end Chris Long said. \"We haven’t been here before, so let’s build on it.\" The Eagles’ joy ride in this muddled N.F.C., where the Los Angeles Rams and Minnesota Vikings are soaring and the Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys are sagging, has been tempered by several injuries: linebacker Jordan Hicks, running back Darren Sproles and the All-Pro left tackle Jason Peters are all done for the season. Philadelphia’s defense, which entered Sunday as the league’s stingiest against the run, is capable of continuing to mitigate these absences. So is Wentz. In discussing Wentz, Hasselbeck recalled a spirited conversation he had with his ESPN colleague, the Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. Hasselbeck has come to espouse Young’s evaluation of quarterbacks: How a quarterback fares between the 20-yard lines doesn’t matter. \"You earn your money on third down and then the red zone,\" Hasselbeck said. \"On third down, this team is relying on you to be this amazing marinara sauce on yesterday’s pasta. Guess what, we don’t have a good answer. Here’s the answer: You make a perfect throw.\" Through Week 8, Philadelphia ranks second in third-down conversion rate (47.8) in large part because of Wentz’s improved precision — his placement in tight spaces, in particular — but also because of his ability to prolong plays with his elusiveness, whether by finding open receivers when coverages break down or scrambling to extend the drive. His eight touchdown tosses and 118.8 passer rating on third down lead the N.F.L., according to the sports data service Sportradar. In the red zone, his 13 touchdowns — including a 1-yarder to Zach Ertz, his favorite target, on Sunday — also lead the league. The Eagles demonstrated conviction in moving up to draft Wentz with the No. 2 pick in 2016. Their trade partner, the Cleveland Browns, did not think Wentz would be a top-20 N.F.L. quarterback. In a somewhat related note, the Browns are 1-26 in their last 27 games. (Should we mention that on draft night this year Cleveland traded the No. 12 pick to the Houston Texans, who selected Deshaun Watson, who as a rookie has thrown 19 touchdowns in seven games? No? O.K.) All told, though, the Eagles’ talent on offense at the time of the 2016 draft was comparable to that of Cleveland’s, maybe even worse. They responded by surrounding Wentz with better players, adding running back LeGarrette Blount and receivers Torrey Smith and Alshon Jeffery, who contorted to catch a jump ball along the sideline Sunday that turned into a 53-yard touchdown. Wentz has also benefited from a full off-season of preparation within Coach Doug Pederson’s system. Remember: Just 14 months ago, before being elevated after Philadelphia shipped Sam Bradford to Minnesota, Wentz ranked behind Chase Daniel on the depth chart. A career understudy, Pederson became so adept at decoding defenses from the sideline, Hasselbeck said, that Brett Favre dubbed him The Front Doctor. From backing up Favre — and also Dan Marino, Steve Bono and Jim McMahon — Pederson said he had observed how they communicated with coaches, talking about play calls and game situations. Pederson welcomes that continuing dialogue with Wentz, who carries enough influence and has engendered enough trust that not only can he recommend plays from his time at North Dakota State — he said he had to call there to get the film — but execute them for touchdowns, as he did on a madcap third-down throw to Corey Clement last week against Washington. The Eagles’ victory Sunday lacked such scintillating moments. The weather was ugly, at times the play was, too, and some of Wentz’s poor throws — he missed an open Jeffery in the end zone — could have prompted the fatalists in the crowd to lapse into that familiar emotion roused whenever something good happens in Philadelphia sports: enthusiasm tinged by the resignation that Wentz will soon be walking beneath a plummeting piano. Eight games in, seven victories, one piano. The good news for Wentz, and the Eagles, is that if another does fall, he probably wouldn’t even realize it.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/sports/carson-wentz-eagles.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'College Football Playoff Rankings: Who Will Get Shut Out?', 'text': ' The first three seasons of the four-team College Football Playoff have raised some fun hypotheticals, but three always stood out above the rest: ■ While at least one of the so-called Power 5 conferences — the Atlantic Coast, the Big 12, the Big Ten, the Pacific-12 and the Southeastern — is guaranteed to be locked out of a four-team party every year, would a final bracket ever omit two of those conferences by taking, say, an independent like Notre Dame, or two teams from the same league? ■ Could a team from one of the lower-tier Group of Five conferences qualify? (This, too, would leave out two power conferences.) ■ Might a pattern develop in which it became clear that one power conference was congenitally unlikely to make the playoff, either by performance or by design? None of these hypotheticals have become reality so far. In each of the playoff’s first three seasons, the bracket comprised four teams from four conferences. And while the Big 12 has been the odd conference out in two of the first three years, that small sample size — combined with the league’s structural disadvantage of having no conference championship game, a deficiency that has been rectified for this season — foreclosed definitive conclusions. Now it is Season Four, and the playoff selection committee will release its first batch of rankings Tuesday night. Then it will repeat the exercise each Tuesday until Dec. 3, when its top four teams will go into the final bracket. The semifinals will take place on New Year’s Day, in the Sugar Bowl and the Rose Bowl, with the national championship scheduled for Jan. 8 in Atlanta. The fun part is that, about two-thirds of the way through the season, all three intriguing — and potentially consequential — possibilities listed above remain on the table. Notre Dame (7-1), ranked No. 5 in The Associated Press poll and with its lone loss coming by one point against No. 2 Georgia, is a contender to make the bracket. Georgia also complicates the math. The Bulldogs (8-0) and No. 1 Alabama (8-0) are among top-tier college football’s five remaining undefeated teams, and both are in the SEC. The committee might look askance at the low quality of their opposition — Georgia has played only two ranked teams and Alabama, as one might say in Tuscaloosa, ain’t played nobody — but if both win out and then play each other in a competitive SEC title game, both might land in the playoff. Outside the Power 5, Central Florida (7-0) of the American Athletic Conference — generally regarded as the closest thing to a sixth power conference — is No. 15 according to The A.P. but, with several blowouts and victories over No. 22 Memphis (7-1) and Navy (5-2), will likely be ranked even higher by the committee. As of now, the Power 5 league least likely to be represented in the playoff is the Pac-12, whose teams have steadily beaten each other; only one of its teams is ranked in The A.P.’s top 15. But also perilously perched is the Big 12, which missed two of the first three playoffs. Its last undefeated team this season, Texas Christian, lost at No. 14 Iowa State on Saturday, dropping to 7-1 and No. 10. No. 8 Oklahoma (7-1) also lost to Iowa State (6-2), and the Sooners still must play No. 11 Oklahoma State (7-1) and T.C.U. There is also a conference title game featuring the league’s two best teams. If chaos ensues in the Big 12, with its four top teams beating one another in irregular fashion, then missing the playoff for the third time in four seasons is a strong possibility. But even more damning would be for the Big 12 champion to deserve to make the playoff — and still fail to get a bid. Take the Sooners, for example, who still could rip off four impressive wins to go with a September victory at No. 3 Ohio State (7-1) — and then find themselves ranked fifth or sixth, behind some combination of the SEC champion, the Big Ten champion, a one-loss A.C.C. champion (or even an undefeated one: hello, Miami!), a great one-loss SEC team and even one-loss Notre Dame. That kind of ego-bruising, budget-blowing disappointment would not be unprecedented. At the end of the 2004 season, Auburn was 12-0 and was passed over for the Bowl Championship Series title game. Although the four-team playoff took another decade to arrive, that Tigers season is seen in retrospect as the moment it became inevitable. If the Big 12, with tradition-rich Oklahoma boasting a deserving résumé and (possibly) a Heisman Trophy winner in quarterback Baker Mayfield, finds its face pressed against the wrong side of the glass yet again, then prepare for more changes to the way college football picks its champion.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/sports/ncaafootball/college-football-playoff-rankings-alabama.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Rest for the Weary, as Battered World Series Pitchers Get a Day Off', 'text': ' LOS ANGELES — In the early hours of Monday morning, Kenley Jansen stood in front of a thicket of cameras and microphones in a quiet Los Angeles Dodgers clubhouse, and insisted he was not tired. At this point, however, a lot of baseball people might beg to differ. And it is not just Jansen, the Dodgers’ superb closer, who appears gassed. A lot of pitchers on both teams do. Many of them pitched in the epic Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday (there were 14 pitchers in all), and among those who came up short were the two Cy Young Award winners who started the game — Clayton Kershaw and Dallas Keuchel. Neither lasted through the fifth inning, and each now carries an earned run average over 5.00 in the Series. Meanwhile, the 30-year-old Jansen, who is critical to the Dodgers’ success, has looked far different from his normal, dominating self as the Series has progressed. After pitching seven times in the first two rounds of the postseason and allowing just one unearned run, he has given up six hits, three runs and two homers in four appearances in the Series. He also has been handed a loss and a blown save. And while he may deny that he is tapped out, his current difficulties are emblematic of the stress and fatigue pitchers confront this late in October. \"I don’t see how you wouldn’t expect that,\" said Brandon Morrow, an equally worn-out Dodgers reliever who has appeared in 12 postseason games this month, including all five in the World Series. \"This is my first time in the postseason and it’s a grind. It’s not just the amount of games you play, but it’s the emotional investment, the incredible focus that everyone has. It wears on you mentally, and that kind of mental focus wears on you physically.\" All of this happened last year, too. By the time the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians reached Game 7 of the World Series, Cubs closer Aroldis Chapman had lost velocity on his fastball and Cleveland’s hitters were able to get to him and nearly steal the game. The normally unhittable Andrew Miller also lost some of his dominance for the Indians late in that series, particularly in Game 7. Morrow said Jansen and the rest of the Dodgers pitchers, and virtually all their counterparts on the Astros, are surely tired at this point. Still, Jansen maintained that his issue was more about an inability to command his pitches in key moments. \"I was missing,\" he said. \"I don’t think it was fatigue.\" The velocity on Jansen’s fastball, which was slightly lower than normal in Game 2 of the World Series, when he suffered his blown save, was back up to 94 miles per hour in Game 5. But at what cost? Some pitching coaches contend that when pitchers are tired, they sometimes try to throw harder — whether consciously or not — in order to make up for lost power. That extra grunt of determination and strength can sometimes cause the pitcher to lose mechanical precision in his delivery. Pitches thus miss their target. Madison Bumgarner, who pitched five scoreless innings of relief for the San Francisco Giants in Game 7 of the 2014 World Series, went through his windups that night looking as if he were playing a casual game of catch on a back field in spring training, so relaxed and composed was his delivery. He seemed to understand that the last thing he needed to do at that moment was overcompensate. As for Jansen, he has not been a complete mess in the Series. But he has not performed in the manner his team is accustomed to seeing. Jansen was fine in Game 1 of the Series. Then, in Game 2, he was asked to get the final six outs, something he had done three times previously in this postseason. In the eighth inning, he gave up a run-scoring single to Carlos Correa that brought Houston to within a run, and in the ninth he blew the save when Marwin Gonzalez homered. Afterward, Jansen said that his signature cut fastball had been flat, which gave the Astros an opening. In Game 4, asked to protect a five-run lead, Jansen gave up a home run to Alex Bregman. The Dodgers won, but it gave Bregman another look at Jansen’s pitches ahead of a key showdown the next night. In Game 5, Jansen pitched a scoreless ninth to preserve a 12-12 tie, giving up a two-out double to Yuli Gurriel before escaping. But in the 10th, things fell apart. With two outs he hit Brian McCann with a pitch and walked George Springer before Bregman’s single allowed pinch-runner Derek Fisher to score the winning run. Jansen and the rest of the pitchers on both teams got some much-needed rest on Monday. But Jansen will almost certainly get the ball again in Game 6 on Tuesday night if he’s needed in the late innings. \"They’re celebrating right now,\" a defiant Jansen said after Game 5. \"But guess what? They’ve still got to beat us one more time.’’', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/sports/kenley-jansen-dodgers-bullpen-astros.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Next Challenge for the Golden Knights: A Long Eastern Road Trip', 'text': ' As Vegas Golden Knights defenseman Luca Sbisa drove from his home in Southern California to Las Vegas for the start of training camp, an odd feeling came over him. \"You take that 15 highway, and all of a sudden you come around the mountains and see The Strip,\" he said. \"And I’m thinking, ‘What am I doing here?

From the beginning, Sbisa said, the new squad developed a close-knit dynamic, because of — not despite — the fact that no one knew who fit where. \"Training camp was the most competitive one I have ever been at,\" said Sbisa, 27, who was selected in the expansion draft from the Vancouver Canucks. \"Everyone has something to prove. Everyone was fighting for ice time, and the coaches didn’t have much history with the players, so everyone had a fair chance. I think it brought out the best of every single player, and that’s why we’ve had a good start. It’s a snowball effect.\" The Golden Knights’ scoring leader entering Monday was James Neal, who helped the Nashville Predators reach the Stanley Cup Finals last season. He had seven goals and three assists through the first nine games. Sbisa had six assists, and Oscar Lindberg had chipped in four goals. \"It’s been smooth getting everyone on the same page,\" said Lindberg, a steady center for the Rangers the past two seasons. \"And the town is crazy for hockey, way better than I could have imagined.\" The Golden Knights have been winning despite an unusual goaltending situation. They traded the backup Calvin Pickard to Toronto the opening week of the season after claiming Malcolm Subban from Boston to be Marc-Andre Fleury’s understudy. Fleury, fresh off winning another Stanley Cup with the Pittsburgh Penguins, was the biggest name in the expansion draft and was expected to be the face of the new franchise. But after starting 3-1, he was sidelined by a concussion. Subban won the next two games before he, too, was injured. So the Knights have now turned to the rookie Oscar Dansk, who has three wins and the first shutout in team history, a 7-0 home victory over the Colorado Avalanche before this six-game trip began. \"It’s about the next guy up and being able to play and we’re getting to know our kids,\" Vegas Coach Gerard Gallant said. \"Our team is working hard. It doesn’t matter who is in net.\" Against the Islanders, the goaltending merry-go-round caught up to the Golden Knights when the rookie Maxime Lagace was forced into action after Dansk left with an apparent lower body injury after John Tavares had tied the contest at 2-2 in the second period. Lagace, the fourth Golden Knights goaltender in 10 games, gave up a goal by Mathew Barzal late in the second, then allowed third-period scores by Cal Clutterbuck, Nikolay Kulemin and Tavares as the Golden Knights lost for only the second time this season. \"It’s crazy but we’ll find a way,\" Lagace said of the team’s goaltending personnel troubles. \"It’s the not the start I wanted, but we will regroup and get back at it tomorrow.\" Gallant emphasized that the excitement surrounding the team’s arrival and the raucous sellout crowds at T-Mobile Arena, where the team played seven of its first ten games, had helped. \"Crowds bring a playoff atmosphere; it’s like a party every night,\" said Gallant, who led the Florida Panthers to the playoffs two seasons ago before he was fired midway through last season. \"They are having fun and the guys are just coming to the rink and having fun.\" There also have been emotional challenges for the young franchise. The shooting outside the Mandalay Bay casino in which 59 people died happened nine days before the Golden Knights’ first home game, and the team played a role in helping the city begin to heal. The veteran defenseman Deryk Engelland, who has lived in Las Vegas since he joined the Wranglers of the ECHL in 2003, was chosen to speak before the home opener against Arizona. The crowd included emergency medical workers, who accompanied the players onto the ice. \"I was pretty nervous; I worked hard to memorize my speech over a few days,\" said Engelland, 35, the team’s elder statesman, who played for Calgary the past three seasons. \"You want to get out there and make a difference as much as you can. I think it helped the crowd getting into it and helped everyone regroup.\" Sbisa, who attended a concert at the location of the shooting two nights before it occurred on Oct. 1, said he immediately felt a kinship with the people of his new hockey home. \"You saw firsthand how the city came together,\" he said. \"So many people were saying, ‘Go out there and get that first win. Give us a distraction and give us a reason to smile.’ It was special. It meant a lot to us, too.\" Embarking on a long trip, which includes stops in Boston, Toronto and Montreal after a visit to the Rangers on Tuesday, the Golden Knights will have more bonding opportunities — and chances to prove they can win away from the energy of home. \"This team is already as tight as any other team I’ve been on because we had no choice but to make the extra effort to come to camp and get to know everyone,\" Sbisa said. \"Everyone went through the same process. It brought us closer together.\" Defenseman Nate Schmidt, a former Washington Capital, said he was grateful to be free of the stifling Beltway traffic. Along with many of his teammates, he lives in Summerlin, minutes from the team’s practice rink. And he is heartened when he is recognized away from the ice. \"People are happy we are in town, and we’re trying to get out in the community as much as we can,\" he said. Amid the rainy weather the Golden Knights experienced over the weekend in their first New York visit, Schmidt laughed as he mulled the sunny nature of desert life. \"When we saw the storm, I realized I hadn’t seen clouds in weeks,\" he said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/sports/hockey/vegas-golden-knights.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'A Big Turnover in the N.F.C.: The Top Teams at Midseason', 'text': ' What do the New Orleans Saints, the Minnesota Vikings, the Los Angeles Rams and the Philadelphia Eagles have in common? Each was left out of the playoffs last season, but in the new power structure of the N.F.C., each team is in first place today. As the midpoint of the N.F.L. schedule approaches, teams that were dismissed as nothing more than early-season surprises are clearly now worthy contenders that can no longer be overlooked. These four teams, which had a combined record of 26-38 last year, are now a combined 23-7. This shake-up is likely to have to be reckoned with in December or January, as playoff time approaches. Because it’s not just about which N.F.C. teams are rising to the top of the standings; it’s also about which teams are notably not in first place this week. The six N.F.C. playoff berths last season went to the Giants, Green Bay, Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit and Seattle. The Seahawks, tied with the Rams, are the only team from that group in first place today. Moreover, the Giants are hapless; the Packers are leaderless; and the Cowboys, the Falcons and the Lions have been dogged by inconsistencies that have left them wandering in the middle of the pack. The Saints (5-2), meanwhile, have won five consecutive games. The winning streak for the Vikings (6-2) is at four games, and the dominant Eagles (7-1) have won six in a row. The Rams (5-2) had a bye Sunday, but they have won their past two games and have scored 74 more points than they have given up, which is the second-best point differential in the N.F.L. (The Eagles are at plus 76.) There’s also something fresh and invigorating about the four upstarts that have climbed atop the N.F.C.’s four divisions. \"We’re having fun and not listening to people telling us what we’re not supposed to be able to do,\" Minnesota’s Case Keenum, a backup quarterback, said after the Vikings’ 33-16 victory over Cleveland (0-8) on Sunday. \"We’ve got a lot of weapons, and we’re cutting it loose.\" Cutting it loose? Sounds like a mantra for the quartet trying to crash the N.F.C. playoff party. There are some common threads to the successful paths these teams have followed. Combined, they are 11-3 on the road, which may be the best measuring stick for excellence in the N.F.L. Also, the Vikings, the Rams, the Eagles and the Saints have defenses that disrupt opposing offenses and distract opposing quarterbacks, something that was on display in Sunday’s games. Consider, for example, that New Orleans won Sunday without Drew Brees, the starting quarterback, throwing a touchdown pass, which had not happened in eight seasons. The Saints’ stellar running back, Mark Ingram, nearly gave the game away to the Chicago Bears twice with fumbles in the fourth quarter, but Ingram’s defensive teammates bailed him out each time. There have not been many games in recent years when the New Orleans defense outshined the offense. But except for one 50-yard carry by Chicago running back Jordan Howard, the Saints held the powerful Howard to 2.36 yards per carry. The Vikings were trailing Cleveland at halftime and led by only a touchdown entering the fourth quarter. Then Minnesota’s front seven sacked Browns quarterback DeShone Kizer three times in the next three Cleveland possessions, and Keenum deftly led the Vikings to a runaway victory. As for the Eagles, even when not playing their best — and that was the case in a 33-10 romp over the San Francisco 49ers (0-8) on Sunday — they still make winning look easy. Having a defense that held the 49ers to 238 yards and sacked the quarterback four times helps considerably. The Eagles are living a charmed existence so far. As quarterback Carson Wentz said: \"Being 7-1? It’s a good place to be.\" Granted, some of the current N.F.C. division leaders have not yet weathered the more challenging portions of their schedules. Then again, as teams that did not make the playoffs a year ago, they generally have less arduous schedules than those of teams that bulled their way into last year’s postseason. It’s called the spoils of parity. But as the N.F.L. schedule rounds the halfway pole and churns toward a still distant finish line, there are new contenders, a couple of surprising, conspicuous laggards and some struggling old powerhouses desperately trying to catch up. Which may not be as new and startling as it may seem. Last season, two-thirds of the teams that qualified for the N.F.C. postseason (Giants, Lions, Falcons and Cowboys) had not been in the playoffs during the previous season. This year may produce the same kind of turnover.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/sports/football/nfc-leading-teams-turnover.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Ezekiel Elliott Likely to Serve Suspension After Ruling', 'text': ' After a long hearing and a lengthy wait for a ruling, Ezekiel Elliott’s temporary restraining order was dissolved and his injunction denied by a federal judge, meaning his six-game suspension will most likely be enforced. The suspension saga for Elliott, the Dallas Cowboys’ star running back, has been a roller coaster since the summer, with both the N.F.L. and the players’ union declaring victory on more than one occasion. But Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the public interest weighed in favor of denying injunctive relief. Her order carried with it a stay of 24 hours to allow the N.F.L. Players Association to consider its appellate options on Elliott’s behalf. The six-game suspension was issued as a result of accusations made by a former girlfriend of Elliott’s in July 2016. Elliott was not arrested or charged by prosecutors, but the N.F.L. used statements by the woman, along with photos of the injuries he is accused of inflicting upon her, to justify the suspension. Six games is the baseline punishment for a player who is a first-time offender under the league’s domestic violence policy. Judge Failla’s ruling stated that the N.F.L.’s arbitrator had given Elliott ample opportunity to challenge the decision and that \"the N.F.L.P.A. has failed to demonstrate a substantial question warranting the extraordinary remedy of injunctive relief or a balance of hardships that decidedly weighs in its favor.\" The next step would most likely be for Elliott and the players’ union to appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and ask for Judge Failla’s ruling to be stayed until he can receive a hearing from that court. Cowboys Coach Jason Garrett held his weekly news conference earlier Monday and said that the team would not have a comment after the ruling, but he acknowledged that the Cowboys had planned for all eventualities. \"We have some veteran running backs,\" he said. \"We have some depth at that position. It’s not like we’re just living this day and we don’t think about the future at all — you have to do that. I think you build your team that way at all positions.\" Elliott began the season with the suspension hanging over his head, and initially it seemed to be affecting him. He had just 277 rushing yards through the first four games, and the Cowboys were 2-2 after ending last season 13-3. He seemed to rediscover his form in a Week 5 loss to Green Bay, and in the past two weeks he exploded for 297 rushing yards and five touchdowns total, re-establishing himself as the centerpiece of the team’s offense and leading the Cowboys back over .500. His absence, if he is not able to further delay the suspension, would drastically affect his team’s playoff hopes. Elliott’s challenge of the suspension, which has come through legal action by the players’ association, rested on the argument that the investigation and appeal had been unfair to him. A federal judge in Texas agreed with that notion, issuing an injunction in early September that blocked the suspension from starting. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit threw out that injunction this month in a 2-1 ruling, saying that the lawsuit on Elliott’s behalf was \"premature\" because all the procedures available under the league’s collective bargaining agreement had yet to be exhausted. The district court had issued a temporary restraining order on Oct. 19 to give Judge Failla time to set a hearing date, but with her decision on Monday, Elliott is quickly running out of options before the N.F.L. is able to enforce the suspension. Dallas is scheduled to host the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, and if Elliott is not available the team will turn to the veteran backups Darren McFadden and Alfred Morris.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/sports/football/ezekiel-elliott-suspended.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Kristaps Porzingis Scores Career-High 38 as Knicks Top Nuggets', 'text': ' Kristaps Porzingis scored a career-high 38 points and Kyle O’Quinn added 15 points and 12 rebounds to help the Knicks beat the Denver Nuggets, 116-110, at Madison Square Garden on Monday night.

In the third quarter, Miller caught an apparent 25-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. As he landed, he became tangled with Saints defensive back Rafael Bush. Miller’s left leg could be seen bending in the wrong direction as he landed. After landing, he rolled over before dropping the ball. The play was reviewed and the pass was ruled incomplete. The call was controversial, but the Bears had other concerns: Miller was grievously injured. Teammates quickly realized the seriousness of the injury and rushed to his side. He left the field on a cart and was taken to the hospital. Miller underwent \"urgent vascular surgery\" in New Orleans to repair a torn popliteal artery, which is near the knee, according to a statement by the team. The operation was described as successful by the Bears on Monday. There was no immediate word on Miller’s future in the sport. Social media accounts of the Bears and their players filled up with messages of concern and support. The injury was severe enough that some wondered if amputation had been an option. While the team did not say if amputation was considered, Coach John Fox told reporters on Monday that the possibility had occurred to him. \"I think that’s always a concern,\" Fox said. \"Our medical people did a great job as far as getting him there. They realized the problem immediately.\" Knee injuries are fairly common in the N.F.L., but the immediate and severe consequences of Miller’s were shocking to many of his teammates. \"I didn’t really want to believe it. I couldn’t believe it,\" wide receiver Tre McBride told reporters after being briefed on the situation. \"I didn’t realize that that was even a possible consequence of having a dislocated knee.\" For now, Miller will not be traveling because of concerns that flying could cause complications with his recovery. Miller, 33, had been the Bears’ top tight end this season with 20 catches for 236 yards, playing all eight games. He has faced injury issues throughout his career: He missed all of the 2012 season with a calf injury, did not play in 2013 after sustaining a concussion during preseason, and sat out the 2014 season with a foot injury. Fox told the assembled reporters on Monday that Miller’s spirits had remained high, and that \"he pretty much wanted his touchdown back.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/sports/football/zach-miller-bears-surgery.html?ref=todayspaper'}], 'arts': [{'title': 'Reading by the Numbers: When Big Data Meets Literature', 'text': ' The history of literary criticism is filled with would-be revolutionaries. But few have issued as radical a cry as Franco Moretti, the professor famous for urging his colleagues to stop reading books. Most literary criticism is grounded in close reading, with scholars poring over individual texts to tease out subtle meanings. But to truly grasp the laws of literature, Mr. Moretti has argued in a series of polemics, requires \"distant reading\": the computer-assisted crunching of thousands of texts at a time. It’s a pie-in-the-sky idea, perhaps, but one that Mr. Moretti has put into practice. Since 2010, Stanford Literary Lab, which he founded with Matthew Jockers, has issued a string of pamphlets chronicling its research into topics ranging from loudness in the 19th-century novel to the evolving language of World Bank reports. Eleven of the pamphlets have now been collected in \"Canon/Archive,\" out next week from n+1 Books. The publication provides something of a retrospective occasion for Mr. Moretti, 67, who retired last spring from Stanford. But it also prompts a larger question at a time when the broader field of digital humanities is booming: What has the Big Data approach to literature added up to? It’s a question that draws heated answers. Digital humanities has been accused of fetishizing science, of acting as a Trojan horse for the corporate forces threatening the university, and worse. A recent broadside in The Chronicle of Higher Education called \"The Digital-Humanities Bust\" took a bludgeon to the field’s revolutionary rhetoric, with Mr. Moretti among those accused of issuing a stream of vague \"promissory notes\" for results that never arrive. Mr. Moretti — who prefers to call the lab’s work \"computational criticism\" — tends to greet such challenges with a mixture of modesty and bravado. \"Our results are not as good as what I had hoped for 10 or 15 years ago,\" he said in an interview earlier this month, during a brief trip to New York. \"We have not yet created a revolution in knowledge. But how much of literary scholarship is even trying to do that?\" [Read about some of the Stanford Literary Lab’s findings.] Mr. Moretti, who was born to teacher parents in a small town in northern Italy (his brother is the filmmaker Nanni Moretti), represents something of a paradox. He’s an intellectual trained in the grand European tradition who questions its most cherished methods. And he’s a professor who has achieved some measure of celebrity by promoting a ruthlessly impersonal idea of both scholarship and literary history itself. Literary criticism typically tends to emphasize the singularity of exceptional works that have stood the test of time. But the canon, Mr. Moretti argues, is a distorted sample. Instead, he says, scholars need to consider the tens of thousands of books that have been forgotten, a task that computer algorithms and enormous digitized databases have now made possible. \"We know how to read texts,\" he wrote in a much-quoted essay included in his book \"Distant Reading,\" which won the 2014 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism. \"Now let’s learn how to not read them.\" These days, Mr. Moretti has softened his rhetoric, though the underlying point is the same. \"Reading is one of life’s greatest pleasures,\" which we \"would be insane\" to give up, he said. \"But the question is whether reading and knowledge are continuous with each other.\" Mr. Moretti’s own output has a similar dividedness. His early work was grounded in close reading, and his last book \"The Bourgeois: Between History and Literature,\" included fine-grained analysis of classic works. That his digital provocations command wide interest even among highly skeptical colleagues may owe something to what Leah Price, professor of English at Harvard, called a \"Nixon in China\" effect. \"Only because his own close readings are so dazzling, does Moretti have the credibility to say: Read as closely as you want, but if you want to understand literary history you’ll need other tools,\" she said. The literary quality of the lab’s pamphlets, which are usually credited to teams of researchers, also doesn’t hurt. Yes, they bristle with bar charts, scatterplot diagrams and sometimes eyeball-blistering terminology. (\"‘Operationalizing’ must be the ugliest word I’ve ever used,\" Mr. Moretti writes in the first sentence of a solo-authored pamphlet called… \"Operationalizing.\") But they are also full of witty asides and suspenseful first-person narration that acknowledges surprises, dead-ends and the collaborative, experimental nature of the lab’s work. \"They’re very good at dramatizing the method,\" said Ted Underwood, a professor at the University of Illinois who also uses computational analysis. \"That’s part of the fun of reading them.\" Some of the lab’s results may seem less than earthshaking. For example, it turns out that what distinguishes the Gothic novel isn’t just castles and ghosts, but more frequent use of the certain verb tenses and prepositions. (The critic Kathryn Schulz, writing about some of the early pamphlets in The New York Times Book Review in 2011, said she \"mostly vacillated between two reactions: ‘Huh?’ and ‘Duh!’\") But even modest-seeming results — like the finding that from 1785 to 1900 the language of the British novel steadily shifted away from words relating to moral judgment to words associated with concrete description — unsettle established ideas of literary history. \"We tend to see literary history as a story of movements, periods, sudden revolutions,\" Mr. Underwood said. \"There are also these really broad, slow, massive changes that we haven’t described before.\" Some of the lab’s findings have themselves had sudden, and totally unexpected, real-world results. Mr. Moretti noted with amusement a flap last spring at the World Bank, where Paul Romer, the chief economist, was relieved of some management duties at its research arm after demanding, among other changes, that its publications reduce their use of the word \"and\" — one of the stylistic tics mocked in \"Bankspeak,\" a Lit Lab pamphlet analyzing the bank’s drift over 60 years toward more abstract and \"self-referential\" language. \"How many literary critics can say they got the chief economist of the World Bank, O.K., not fired, but deprived of some of his power?\" Mr. Moretti said with a laugh. Since retiring from Stanford, Mr. Moretti has moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he is helping to create a new digital humanities program at the country’s leading polytechnic. He also has a full slate of writing projects, including a study of forgotten 19th-century British best-sellers and an algorithm-free book based on his undergraduate lectures on American culture, to be published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. Even if the results of computational criticism never catch up with his early polemical fervor, Mr. Moretti remains unapologetic about trying. \"I’d rather be a failed revolutionary,\" he said, \"than someone who never tried to do a revolution in the first place.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/franco-moretti-stanford-literary-lab-big-data.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': '‘Poet in Spain’ Offers New Translations of Lorca’s Soulful Work', 'text': ' The poet and playwright Federico García Lorca is, after Cervantes, the most commanding figure in Spain’s literature. He died young, executed at 38 by nationalist forces at the start of the Spanish Civil War. This early death has rendered him a permanent political and cultural object of desire. During his lifetime Lorca feared what he called \"stupid fame.\" It’s hard to say what he would make of the flourishing industry of works (ballets, operas, films, novels, pop songs, poems) that reference and adapt his life and work. Lorca’s body was never found. This hasn’t stopped artists from figuratively pickpocketing it, hoping to nick a bit of his gravitas and spirit, and to import tragic frissons by association. His work is less read today than it is projected upon. Lorca was a great explicator of duende, the idea that an artwork should brim with authenticity and death-awareness and skin-prickling and foot-stamping awe and soul. He evoked duende perhaps most fully in his \"Gypsy Ballads,\" published in 1928. It’s a canonical book in Spain. Here was a highly cultivated poet reworking Andalusian folk culture and myth. The high-low effect was startling. It was as if Robert Lowell had made a murderous little book that drew its inspiration from Harry Smith’s \"Anthology of American Folk Music.\" The poet and translator Sarah Arvio is here now with \"Poet in Spain,\" a new translation of Lorca’s poems into English. It is the first major undertaking of its kind since \"Collected Poems: A Bilingual Edition\" (1991), the work of several translators and edited by Christopher Maurer. Unlike Maurer, Arvio omits Lorca’s intemperate and political and Whitman-inflected New York poems, written after he visited the city in 1929 and 1930. (These were published after his death under the title \"Poet in New York.\") She focuses instead entirely on what she calls his \"moonlit earthbound Spanish poems.\" About Lorca’s New York versus his Spanish poems, Arvio writes, \"To my ear, these voices are so different they could almost be the voices of two different poets.\" The crucial word here is \"almost.\" The absence of these vital poems immediately renders Arvio’s book less necessary than Maurer’s in terms of seeing this complicated poet whole. There are consolations. Arvio is a supple translator, and she has delivered a personal book. She has felt free to shift Lorca’s poems around in sequence, as he himself often did when putting together his books. Most notably she has shorn the poems of punctuation, as Lorca sometimes did in his drafts. The spare effect can be riveting. Take this snippet of \"Dreamwalking Ballad\": At other moments, the punctuation is missed. You feel Lorca has been tamped down. His poem \"Cazador\" (\"Hunter\"), for example, begins with these words: \"¡Alto pinar!\" Arvio translates this, with a vast diminution in energy, as \"High grove of pines.\" Lorca wrote in an exclamatory style that gave his work a flamenco brashness. Witness the first stanza of \"Árboles\" (\"Trees\") from 1919: Arvio renders this in telegraphic yet somewhat lobotomized fashion: At other moments, Arvio’s translations are both less accurate and less felicitous than those in Maurer’s edition. The opening lines of \"Reyerta\" (\"Brawl\" or \"Feud\"), for example, read this way: \"En la mitad del barranco / las navajas de Albacete, / bellas de sangre contraria, / relucen como los peces.\" Arvio gives us this translation: \"Halfway down the gully / the blades from Albacete / glisten like fishes / flush with fighting blood.\" In Maurer’s book, it is: \"Halfway down the gorge / knives of Albacete, / beautiful with enemy blood, / shine like fish.\" Beautiful with enemy blood. That isn’t just a gorgeous phrase, ripe with meaning, but it comports more exactly with Lorca’s Spanish. The poems in this book include not only \"Gypsy Ballads,\" but the \"Dark Love Sonnets,\" with their death-haunted homoeroticism, and poems about the deadly goring of Lorca’s friend the bullfighter Ignacio Sánchez Mejías, among others. Lorca’s poems from Spain are a poetry of dreams and journeys and glimpses from balconies, of sunbaked meadows and realms of erotic yearning. He went to the well often for the same elemental imagery: the sea, the wind, the moon, flowers and trees. His mind worked feverishly enough to induce hallucinations. He completed 13 plays and nine books of verse between 1917 and 1936. This book includes one of those plays, a rich and gripping retranslation of \"Blood Wedding,\" written in 1932. It’s an unconventional choice to print it in a book of poems, but Arvio argues and then demonstrates that the language in it is of a piece with Lorca’s blood-warm verse. The poet Ted Hughes, who once translated \"Blood Wedding,\" observed that \"Lorca cannot be Englished.\" Perhaps. But his life and work offer mysteries we’re still profitably untangling.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/books/review-poet-in-spain-federico-garcia-lorca-sarah-arvio.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Review: ‘Illyria’ Eavesdrops on a Young Joe Papp and Friends', 'text': ' You have been invited to eavesdrop on a great man’s birthday party. He is not, at this point, widely regarded as any kind of titan. The mantle that will later be conferred by headlines, testimonials and biographies has yet to fall upon his shoulders. But if you keep quiet and behave well, even when others at this improvised shindig do not, you’ll hear the murmur of cultural history in the making. Strange, isn’t it, how very ordinary it sounds? And how annoyingly aggrieved and, well, small the birthday boy appears in his sulky silence. Richard Nelson’s \"Illyria,\" a grave and gossipy whisper of a play set in the Bohemian grooves of Manhattan in 1958, portrays a time when our 37-year-old birthday boy was down on his luck and feeling defeated. His name, by the way, is Joe Papp. That’s the guy who founded the Public Theater, which is the place where Mr. Nelson’s latest drama opened on Monday night. Embodied with a distracted air and a sneaky tyrannical streak by the excellent John Magaro, Joe isn’t squarely in the spotlight for much of this production, which is directed by Mr. Nelson. But if you lean in and listen — and you’ll have to, since people evidently mumbled in the late 1950s — you’ll detect the tidal tug of an ego that would reshape the landscape of New York theater. Among American dramatists, Mr. Nelson is the great master of medias res, thrusting audiences into the midst of critical conversations that were initiated long before the curtain goes up. It’s a technique he has realized to perfection in his great cyclical works set in Rhinebeck, N.Y., \"The Apple Family Plays\" and \"The Gabriels,\" staged at the Public Theater between 2010 and 2016. Those uniquely topical dramas explored of-the-moment events through the eyes of two different families. They were vivid slice-of-life works in which meals were prepared and consumed, as the people onstage looked at a changing nation from their own beleaguered corner of it. Mr. Nelson takes a similarly sideways approach in \"Illyria,\" with more mixed results. If you don’t know much about the real Joseph Papp (1921-1991), you may wonder what the heck’s going on and why you should be interested. If you do know a lot about Papp and his associates, you may be a bit exasperated by the liberties Mr. Nelson has taken in bringing them to life. But \"Illyria\" also affords distinctive if fleeting pleasures that no one these days does better than Mr. Nelson. I mean the sense of experiencing life, in all its trivia and eventfulness, happening in a very specific moment, among people who know one another well. And once again, Mr. Nelson has assembled a fine cast that wears its alter egos with the ease of old cardigans. Aside from Joe, only one of the characters is likely to be familiar to much of the audience. That’s the formidable actress Colleen Dewhurst (played by Rosie Benton), who is just beginning to forge a career in the late 1950s. In \"Illyria,\" she appears as the hostess of the last-minute birthday bash in the play’s second scene, and she by no means dominates the proceedings. Though the scandalous professional behavior of her future husband, George C. Scott, is much discussed, Colleen is just one of many theatrical aspirants here, a band of almost equals still struggling to make a living. She’s part of Joe’s nascent New York Shakespeare Festival, which puts on plays from the canon for free in the city’s parks. Others on the team include Joe’s actress wife, Peggy (Kristen Connolly), who has just had a baby; the press agent Merle Debuskey (Fran Kranz); the stage manager John Robertson (Max Woertendyke); and the composer David Amram (Blake DeLong). The resident director is Stuart Vaughan (John Sanders), whose wife, Gladys (Emma Duncan), is Joe’s assistant. Local theater buffs may recognize the names of Mr. Debuskey and Mr. Vaughan, as well as that of another character, Bernie Gersten (Will Brill), a longtime friend of Papp’s who would become a producer at his Shakespeare Festival and later Lincoln Center. The dramatis personae is rounded out by Mary Bennett (Naian González Norvind), a young actress new to this insular world. Mostly these people just talk and, this being a play by Mr. Nelson, eat (sandwiches, generally). The subjects of conversation melt and swirl and resurface in thick eddies. They include who to cast as Olivia in \"Twelfth Night,\" Peggy’s reluctant return to the stage and the consequences of Joe’s and Bernie’s being summoned before the House Un-American Activities Committee for suspected Communist affiliations. The political taint of such presumed associations has put Joe’s fledging troupe in jeopardy, and we hear accounts of his run-ins with the city’s parks department, then overseen by the mighty Robert Moses. Will the establishment put the kibosh on these maverick idealists? Will \"Twelfth Night\" in Central Park, the occasion for the play’s third and final scene, be this troupe’s last production? These dramatic questions are not posed with histrionic flourish in \"Illyria.\" (The title comes from the fantastical setting for \"Twelfth Night.\") Often they loom less large than romantic crosscurrents and nagging rivalries, particularly between Joe and the more successful Stuart, whom Mr. Sanders portrays with a canny subliminal smugness. Theatergoers expecting the explosions, resolutions and emotional payoffs of a conventionally well-made play are likely to leave \"Illyria\" frustrated. Though it verges on starry-eyed sentimentality in its final scene, most of this production — designed with spot-on period detail by Susan Hilferty and Jason Ardizzone-West — refrains from thematic signposting. Instead, it inhabits a landscape where the petty and the momentous are practically indistinguishable, and even the strongest feelings are muddied with ambivalence. The real Joe Papp, showman that he was, might have deemed \"Illyria\" too muted and inconclusive to be satisfying. Theatergoers with patience, though, will be rewarded by moments throughout when they will feel transformed into proverbial flies on the walls of a distant time and place. Real life is happening, as boring and confusing and riveting as it usually appears without the magnifying lens of hindsight.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/theater/review-illyria-eavesdrops-on-a-young-joe-papp-and-friends.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Review: ‘Red Roses, Green Gold’ Brings Back the Grateful Dead', 'text': ' For an act to get the jukebox-musical treatment, hits are a minimum requirement. Abba, Frankie Valli and Carole King all had success on the charts before their music overtook Broadway with \"Mamma Mia!,\" \"Jersey Boys\" and \"Beautiful.\" The Grateful Dead had only one Top 10 song, \"Touch of Grey,\" and yet here is \"Red Roses, Green Gold,\" Off Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theater. Not only that, but this is the third show the writer Michael Norman Mann has created using the Dead’s catalog, after \"Cumberland Blues\" in 1998 and \"Shakedown Street\" in 2005. Not too bad for a band whose reputation was built on intense touring and extended live jams. The good news is that the songs, which lean heavily on a classic Americana sound, are effective in a sit-down, smoke-free theatrical context. The show, which is billed as \"featuring the music of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter\" (Mr. Hunter was the Dead’s nonperforming lyricist), sometimes feels like a wacky relative of the Steve Martin and Edie Brickell Broadway bluegrass musical \"Bright Star.\" Even better for non-Deadheads, \"Red Roses, Green Gold\" lasts just over two hours rather than four, with numbers that mostly clock in around three or four minutes. Unfortunately, Mr. Mann has shoehorned them into a cartoonishly corny story. Like \"Cumberland Blues,\" the show takes place in a theme-park version of a Maryland mining town in the 1920s, more specifically at the saloon and mining company owned by the debonair Jackson Jones (Scott Wakefield). Alas, a pair of scheming brothers (Brian Russell Carey and Michael McCoy Reilly) have their sights on taking over the Palace, which is that in name only. To nobody’s surprise, their plan is foiled at the last minute, thanks in no small part to Jackson’s prodigal son, Mick, played by Michael Viruet as a Jimi Hendrix-esque rogue prone to flashing his nipple rings and manscaped torso. While I am not a professional historian, these do not appear to be period- or setting-accurate. The zany mood is furthered by Rachel Klein’s bouncy staging and Ásta Bennie Hostetter’s colorful costumes, which land somewhere between Laurel Canyon hippie bohemia and carnivalesque traveling show, with nods to the Dead’s trademark red roses and skeletons. As manic as the goings-on are, they cannot entirely detract from the music, which borrows extensively the Dead’s two best studio albums, \"American Beauty\" and \"Workingman’s Dead,\" both from 1970 — plus, yes, \"Touch of Grey.\" Arranged by the keyboardist Jeff Chimenti, a longtime satellite in the Dead galaxy, the songs are drenched in folk, country and blues, and rendered quite well by the multitasking cast, which plays all the instruments. \"Truckin’\" and \"Friend of the Devil\" rumble along like the classic bar boogies they are, but the most striking numbers are the quietest ones, such as \"Box of Rain,\" delivered by Natalie Storrs and David Park, who portray Jackson’s daughter and her love interest. When the cast comes back for encores, Ms. Storrs belts out the kind of vocal runs that are Broadway’s answer to jammy solos.

Jenny Holzer, who also signed the letter, gave permission for the group to use the text from her work, \"Abuse of Power Comes As No Surprise.\" Mr. Landesman resigned from his longtime post as publisher of the magazine on Wednesday after a lawsuit was filed accusing him of sexually harassing at least nine women. More women have since come forward with stories alleging his misconduct. Michelle Kuo, the magazine’s editor in chief, also resigned, and the magazine’s staff posted a note criticizing its publisher. A spokesperson for the magazine said all contact with Mr. Landesman has been suspended, and that while three advertisers have pulled out of future issues, far more have pledged their continued support to the magazine. The open letter calls on art institutions to remove offenders and confront inequality and abuse. \"Your actions will no longer be a secret, whispered amongst us for fear of ostracization, professional shunning, and recrimination. Where we see the abuse of power, we resolve to speak out.\" The letter emerged out of a group WhatsApp chat among ten members of the art community Oct. 24.

It was amazing to witness this huge group of people across different continents formulating this letter together,\" said Vanessa Carlos, a co-founder of the London gallery Carlos/Ishikawa, who was on the original group chat. \"There are a lot of stories that women shared in the WhatsApp group, and a lot of them are not ready to come forward publicly. It was really hurtful to know that they still didn’t feel they could come forward, even in the current conversation.\" The letter also announces the start of an online campaign, Not Surprised, across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. \"This is really an initial step of what most people have expressed desire to be a longer-term engagement,\" Ruba Katrib, who is curator at MoMA PS1 and signed the letter, said. \"There’s a real recognition that needs to take place that this is an actual problem and affects a huge percentage of people working in the contemporary art industry.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/knight-landesman-artforum-laurie-anderson-cindy-sherman.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Niall Horan Helps One Direction Tie a Beatles Chart Record', 'text': ' One Direction now shares something big with the Beatles: Both groups are the only ones to have had three members reach No. 1 on the Billboard chart with solo albums.

Franco Momente, the director of the company, Natural Le Coultre, confirmed the sale Friday. No price was disclosed. Mr. Bouvier, who is Swiss, made his reputation as a businessman involved with freeports, the largely tax-free storage depots where wealthy collectors now store so many of their treasures. In addition to operating in Geneva, where his storage spaces have been filled with many of the world’s most famous and expensive masterpieces, he also opened new facilities in Luxembourg and Singapore where his businesses continue to operate. But in the past few years Mr. Bouvier has been battling legal cases in courtrooms in Monaco, Paris, Singapore and New York, and has likely been facing mounting legal bills as part of that effort. His fiercest adversary has been Dmitry E. Rybolovlev, a Russian billionaire art collector, for whom Mr. Bouvier helped amass one of the world’s most valuable art collections. But Mr. Rybolovlev accused him of fraud and said he had been overcharged by as much as $1 billion on the sale of multiple pieces of art by Mr. Bouvier, who was arrested in Monaco. The case is ongoing, but Mr. Bouvier has made counterclaims, including assertions that the Monaco officials pursuing him were biased in favor of Mr. Rybolovlev. The Monaco minister for justice took early retirement last month after Le Monde reported on a series of friendly text messages exchanged between the minister and a lawyer for Mr. Rybolovlev. Both sides deny any wrongdoing. The sale this week involved only the Geneva-based storage and shipping business, and did not include Mr. Bouvier’s shareholdings in the art storage warehouses in Luxembourg and Singapore, Mr. Momente said. The Geneva business was bought by a French shipping company, André Chenue SA. The French company and Mr. Bouvier’s lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for further details. Mr. Momente said it made sense to link up with André Chenue, which he described as a major player in the industry. \"We have known them for many, many years,\" he said. All of the Geneva company’s 43 employees are expected to keep their jobs. Mr. Rybolovlev has been selling several of the works he bought with Mr. Bouvier’s help, including the last known Leonardo da Vinci in private hands, \"Salvator Mundi\" or \"Savior of the World.\" The Leonardo da Vinci work, estimated to have a value of $100 million, is being sold by Christie’s as part of its November Contemporary art sale.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/arts/yves-bouvier-sells-his-geneva-based-art-storage-company.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'At 100, Thelonious Monk Gets a Hero’s Celebration', 'text': ' DURHAM, N.C. — In some sense, Thelonious Monk’s songs present the jazz musician’s perfect challenge. They’re opaque, lumbering and miraculously catchy. Played right, each passing harmony feels rich enough to last an entire song. But if you can’t make these pieces move — get them feeling spry, almost balletic — you’ve lost the battle. On the final two nights of a 10-day festival here celebrating Monk’s 100th birthday, two of today’s great tenor saxophonists put their hands on his music. From very different angles, they showed what makes him jazz’s most popular composer to cover, and one of its most difficult. The context was the same for Joshua Redman on Wednesday as it was for Ravi Coltrane on Thursday: They were backed by a standard jazz trio led by the pianist Ethan Iverson as they played tight renditions of classic Monk repertoire. But while Mr. Redman soloed with a smokestack effusiveness, getting underneath the melodies and setting them alight, Mr. Coltrane’s horn was liquid. It seemed to move freely on its own, as if any expansion or turn was coming directly from the notes themselves. The festival, Monk@100, was produced by Duke University, and studiously programmed by Mr. Iverson and Aaron Greenwald, the director of Duke Performances. It was the highest-profile and probably the most far-reaching of the many Monk tributes happening this year, and it attested to the durability of Monk’s influence, even at a time when consensus in jazz has grown rare. The major focus, perhaps inevitably, was on Monk’s pen. The 60-plus tunes he is known to have written are some of the most beloved pieces in jazz’s canon, partly because they live just barely outside of its conventional language. That’s what the daytime show on Oct. 21 was about, when five pianists took turns playing solo and duo renditions of almost every work Monk wrote. The same applied for the performances of the J.D. Allen Trio, which worked with a different guest each of the festival’s first three nights. But it went beyond that. On Oct. 20, the pianist Jason Moran came together in a duo with the drummer and multi-instrumentalist Tyshawn Sorey. (I wasn’t in town for this part of the festival but was able to watch video shot by a film crew documenting the entire event. That footage may someday be public.) Their first set began with a loose reading of the ruminative melody to \"Monk’s Mood\" and ventured quickly into abstraction, dispatching with the standard ideas of what it takes to interpret Monk’s music. This set was one of the moments when the spirit of Monk’s piano playing got called up and shocked back to life in the air of the present day. This came naturally through Mr. Moran’s fingers and his memory. He grew up idolizing Monk and reworked Monk’s language of halting gestures and piquant dissonance, eventually rendering his own approach. Playing with Mr. Sorey here, he often reduced Monk’s song themes to scaffolds and wisps; his own chiming, splintery swing feels attested to Monk’s long shadow, even in a context dominated by free improvisation. \"I didn’t learn what the normal way is to do things: Monk is my normal way to do things,\" Mr. Moran said after the festival, describing his formative years. \"When that’s the bar that you pull against, you already know certain things about how the body works with the piano, how important dance is to a song, how great swing feels at a medium tempo if you’re doing it right.\" Starting in the early 1940s, Monk became a major architect of the style known as bebop — and, immediately, an iconoclast within it. He helped devise its language of thick harmonies, zipping melodies and steamed-up rhythm. But Monk maintained a rough piano style and wrote tunes to reflect it; his virtuosity worked on a level that was more tonal, and more physical. (In Monk’s musical manuscripts, which Mr. Iverson discovered on eBay and posted to his personal blog, he even invents a more evocative way of spelling a bell sound: \"Tding tding tding.\") Rather than dashing futurism, his bebop was about arrangement and choreography. Each note in his compositions sounds like a weight-bearing limb, supporting the body of the song and leading into the next movement. And those limbs often pause to hold a pose: On a simple, singsong piece like \"Rhythm-a-Ning\" or a wound-up work like \"Criss Cross,\" he uses silence more than speed. \"There are few artists that everyone would have such a uniform agreement on: ‘Yes, let’s check out this repertoire,’\" Mr. Iverson said in an interview Thursday. \"Everyone that has come down to do this festival has been like, ‘Oh yeah, I’d like to study some Monk.’ Everybody is excited and sometimes a little daunted by trying to play the songs right, trying to have a personal opinion.\" A hundred years after Monk’s birth, on Oct. 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, N.C., roughly 60 miles east of Durham, we’re deep into something like the post-history of jazz — at least as a definable style and a set of universal touchstones. New ensembles rarely spend much time on standard repertoire, and most mainline jazz is growing from the conservatory and the composer’s mind, not the fertile space of jam sessions. (Monk first developed a following as the house pianist at Minton’s, the Harlem club whose jam sessions in the ’40s incubated bebop.) To be an improvising musician nowadays almost always means writing your own textbook, often with source material from outside the blues and jazz tradition. Still, learning to play Monk’s music remains an almost unavoidable rite of passage. He is one of many jazz luminaries whose 100th birthdays fall this year, including Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald and Buddy Rich, but his has seemed to matter the most. Festivals well beyond Durham programmed tribute content this year. The Jazz Standard in Manhattan devoted three weeks to consecutive Monk-related shows, from vastly disparate artists. Even Jazz at Lincoln Center, whose most intimate stage, Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, is named for Gillespie, devoted more programming this month to Monk. (Gillespie’s birthday was on Oct. 21.) A host of albums have come out reinterrogating Monk’s compositions. At Durham Fruit and Produce Company, an old warehouse that has recently been retrofitted as a small performing arts venue, sculptural work by the North Carolina-based artist André Leon Gray was installed throughout the building: near the entrance, an altar with accouterments to Monk; down the hall, an image of the pianist’s silhouette inscribed with his catchphrase, \"Always know;\" onstage, a tar painting of Monk’s face, surrounded by black and white keys arranged in a loose asymmetry. And in the lobby, just beside the makeshift bar, there was a listening station with some turntables set up. Vinyl copies of Monk’s full discography were available for attendees to spin. The afternoon before the festival’s final show, when Mr. Coltrane performed with Mr. Iverson’s trio, I sat down and cued up \"Monk’s Music,\" the classic septet recording from 1957. (A young John Coltrane, Ravi’s father, appears on the album.) The festival’s live proceedings seemed to defend jazz’s old idea that the onstage ritual can encompass both veneration and invention. And then there was the listening station: a reminder that the old texts remain. In a time of postmodern splay, Monk is here to stay.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/music/thelonious-monk-centennial-festival.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Japanese Art, on Its Own Terms', 'text': ' METZ, France — French and Japanese flags flap in tandem at the Pompidou Center here, hailing the fall program at this sister venue of the Paris museum of contemporary art. Its exhibitions include one about Japanese architecture from 1945 to the present day, and the recently opened \"Japanorama,\" a survey of Japan’s contemporary art since 1970, on view through March 5. \"Japanorama\" picks up where an important 1986 exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris, \"Avant-Garde Arts of Japan 1910-1970,\" left off. That show presented some important Japanese artists abroad for the first time — but it examined their work as influenced by, and even dependent on, Western art traditions. Aomi Okabe, who was part of the 1986 show’s curatorial committee and is currently artistic director of exhibitions at the Japanese Culture House of Paris, said that, at the time, \"the French public considered modern Japanese paintings of the early 20th century copies of European art, especially from France.\" The subtitle of \"Japanorama\" is \"New Vision on Art Since 1970,\" the year that Japan began to reassert its own cultural identity, spurred by the new confidence it found at Expo ’70 in Osaka. The show is a \"discovery of what was overlooked,\" the curator, Yuko Hasegawa, said. While Japan wrestled with complicated issues of modernization and heritage, its culture was understood in the West though clichéd binaries: The ascetic Zen of a rock garden on one hand, the gleeful kitsch of Hello Kitty on the other. The exhibition corrects this reductive caricature, examining the way the push and pull between tradition and technology, individual and collective, have shaped the culture in unique ways. For European audiences, what’s new about this \"New Vision\" is examining contemporary Japanese art on its own terms. European interest in Japanese art dates back to the 19th century — van Gogh collected Ukiyo-e prints, Monet modeled his water lily pond at Giverny on Japanese gardens — yet many of today’s art institutions rarely showcase non-Western contemporary art. There have been piecemeal exhibitions in Paris over the past year, among them shows at the Palais de Tokyo, Le Bal, Fondation Cartier and the European House of Photography. But no exhibition here in France has examined Japanese creativity across eras, mediums and generations. In 2016, the French and Japanese governments announced Japonism, a diplomatic initiative to highlight Japanese culture through exhibitions and events in France in 2018. The cooperation is a mixed blessing, according to the Franco-Japanese gallerist Jean-Kenta Gauthier, who represents both European and Japanese artists. \"I’m really happy about this — the Japanese scene is worthy of being presented in depth and detail,\" he says. However, \"there’s the fear of returning to orientalism.\" He added, \"There’s nothing worse for an artist than becoming a curiosity.\" How to prevent flattening cultural context while encouraging foreign audiences to embrace the unfamiliar? Ms. Hasegawa tackles that question in \"Japanorama.\" Having previously presented Japanese contemporary art in Brazil, Britain and Germany, she \"looked very carefully at the past 10-15 years: what was organized, what kind of Japanese contemporary art has been collected in public institutions in Europe.\" She continued: \"I want to bring awareness to context behind what people misunderstand, to the social commentary behind the works.\" Ms. Hasegawa’s vast and thoughtful synopsis encompasses six themes (called \"archipelagos\") that bridge art, architecture, video, fashion and music. She porously connects movements and multimedia across two floors, with a mise-en-scène conceived by the Tokyo architects SANAA. (The Pompidou Center Metz itself was designed by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban). The first section, \"Strange Object/Post-Human Body,\" confronts visitors with \"Electric Dress,\" a multicolored cluster of lights, created in 1956 by Atsuko Tanaka, that prefigures today’s evolving relationship between the physical and the digital. The piece resonates with Comme des Garçons garments on display, which present an alternative approach to Western ideas of beauty and body image. Transfigurations unfurl throughout this section: Ms. Hasegawa notes \"traumatic ideas about the atomic bomb and pollution-activated mutation\" in two \"very weird, very critical\" late 1960s cocoon pods by Tetsumi Kudo). New technology informs the work of the ’80s collective Dumb Type, the techno-pop musical outfit Yellow Magic Orchestra and the programmers and artists behind Rhizomatiks. Rhizomatiks contributes a visualization of Bitcoin’s blockchain system rejigged according to live transactions, in a digital ballet that shows a forward-looking evolution of Japanese creativity. Within the Pop Art sphere, Ms. Hasegawa has highlighted works with a strong conceptual background and Japanese specificity. She wishes to undercut the way in which Japanese pop culture is often understood as sunny or silly: The graphic kitsch is, in fact, inherently critical, she says. \"It’s vernacular — but also very sophisticated,\" she added. The artist Takashi Murakami’s work in this vein, is perhaps the most well-known, but it is also the most misunderstood. The painted smileys of his \"Cosmos\" are not just bright and fun — the composition owes everything to 18th-century Edo paintings. His lesser-known \"Polyrhythm Red\" canvas, adorned with Tamiya soldier figurines, reflects, Ms. Hasegawa said, \"Japanese culture becoming childish,\" and a malaise about violence and vulnerability. The exhibition also overturns the seeming naïveté of \"kawaii,\" Japan’s signature brand of cute, to reveal assertions of sociopolitical frustration. A 2002 kimono using Bingata, the traditional dyed fabric of Okinawa — where the artist Yuken Teruya grew up, near a United States Army base — is especially striking. The cheery flowers and trees on the garment are, upon closer inspection, composed of fighter planes and parachutes. The exhibition concludes with a section on \"Materiality and Minimalism,\" highlighting examples such as Hiroshi Sugimoto’s calm photographs of horizon lines and Ryoji Ikeda’s trancelike work based on numerical data. \"It’s a landing,\" Ms. Hasegawa said of the exhibition’s finale, to \"look at something sublime.\" Kohei Nawa’s breathtaking \"Force,\" an installation of viscous black silicone oil, which rains down without making a splash, appears soothing, but this is deceptive: Its subject is radioactive fallout. Like many works in \"Japanorama,\" it shows that simple does not mean straightforward, that beautiful things can contain disquieting fears. To grapple with these nuances requires being open to another perspective. In this sense, the show’s most emblematic piece is by the artist Shimabuku. His video \"Then, I Decided to Give a Tour of Tokyo to the Octopus from Akashi,\" is as gently funny as it is affecting. He collects an octopus from his hometown and brings it to the metropolis on the bullet train — takes it to the fish market, introduces it to another octopus there — and eventually releases it back into the sea. It’s a fitting narrative for visitors to the exhibition, who, at the end, are returned to their usual setting, more enlightened for having explored an unfamiliar territory.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/arts/design/japanese-art-on-its-own-terms.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown’ and ‘Major Crimes’', 'text': ' The final season of \"Major Crimes\" begins on TNT.

Where normally fish and crabs dart about forests of coral and sponges, \"all we could can see was a parking lot full of nets and lines, with no life at all.\" Mr. Kerby and Brendan Roark, a geographer at Texas A&M University, are comparing seamounts that have been fished to those in pristine, protected areas. This month, they surveyed the upper reaches of four seamounts, one of which, Hancock, lies inside Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which includes the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. They knew that the seamounts had been fished by trawlers and coral harvesters at some point. \"But the extent of the devastation and the huge amount of gear that was abandoned on the bottom were shocking for both of us,\" he said. Among the casualties littering the seabed were ten-foot-tall black corals that can live over 4,000 years, among the oldest forms of life on earth. \"Allowing fishing in the few protected seamounts left would be a huge mistake,\" said Dr. Roark. It’s a sentiment widely shared among marine ecologists. The Trump administration is considering rolling back federal protections for 10 national monuments, including two in the central Pacific. The Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument and the Rose Atoll National Marine Monument protect the waters around a handful of islands, most uninhabited, to the south of the Hawaii Islands. The shore reefs of the islands have long been protected from commercial fishing; the monument designations extended that protection to 50 miles from shore in some cases and 200 miles in others. According to a memo obtained by the Washington Post in September, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has recommended that the designations of the Pacific Remote Islands and the Rose Atoll be amended \"to allow commercial fishing.\" (A similar recommendation was made for another marine monument, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, off the coast of New England.) The memo did not mention the largest marine reserve: Papahānaumokuākea, a string of mostly uninhabited atolls and reefs that have been largely undisturbed since World War II. At about 583,000 square miles, it is the largest protected area on the planet. (Industry officials in Hawaii are pressing for commercial fishing to be allowed there, too.) Many scientists see these marine reserves as among the last rich, untouched ecosystems where they can study the effects of climate change in isolation from the impacts of overfishing or pollution. The fishing industry here in Hawaii sees it differently. A driving force behind the administration’s reconsideration is an obscure but powerful quasi-governmental organization called the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, or Wespac, based in Honolulu. The council has jurisdiction over the waters where 140 long-line vessels based in Hawaii — as well as a handful in American Samoa — fish mostly for tuna and billfish. Wespac has argued that limits on catch, gear and fishing seasons are the best tools to regulate fishing and to ensure that the Pacific yields the maximum sustainable harvests. Over the years, the council has strongly opposed the creation and expansions of each of the marine monuments. This year, the council has embraced a new slogan: \"Make America Great Again: Return U.S. fishermen to U.S. waters.\" In a presentation to members of the other fisheries councils in February, Wespac officials claimed the marine monuments \"curtailed economic growth\" and \"compromised national food security.\" Ray Hilborn, a fisheries expert at the University of Washington and a scientific adviser to Wespac, argues that tuna and billfish are highly migratory and travel in and out of the reserves. \"The monuments just force the fishermen to go farther and spend more fuel to catch the same fish,\" he said in an interview. \"It’s a fake protection.\" Asked whether Wespac sought to reintroduce fishing only in monument waters or also in near-shore reefs, Kitty Simonds, the longtime executive director, said in an email that the council also would review \"the management measures that were in place before the monument designation and may recommend changes.\" The fishing industry in Hawaii is hardly in trouble, several experts noted. Indeed, the Hawaii fleet’s bigeye tuna catch has doubled since 2006, even though half of America’s Pacific waters are now off-limits to fishing. Robert Richmond, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii, pointed out that the Hawaii fleet filled its yearly quota of bigeye in August this year, \"so they obviously don’t need more space to fish. They’re just against all protected areas on principle.\" Over 500 million people depend on reefs for protein, Dr. Richmond said, and they already yield far less than they could if they were sustainably fished. Reef ecosystems may become even less productive as the ocean gets warmer and more acidic. Dr. Richmond and other scientists also took issue with Dr. Hilborn’s criticism of marine monuments. They say the reserves serve as havens for species depleted elsewhere and for populations migrating away from the Equator, where warming waters are lowering plankton density. \"The fisheries benefits of marine reserves are now beyond doubt,\" Callum Roberts, a marine conservation biologist at the University of York, said in an email. \"They allow fish populations to grow back and spill fish into surrounding waters, they pour fountains of offspring into ocean currents that seed fisheries, and they provide resilience to environmental shocks.\" The tools favored by fisheries officials target a few species to the neglect of others, he added, while \"reserve benefits reach entire ecosystems.\" One of the islands on Mr. Zinke’s list is Palmyra, an atoll that lies 1,000 miles south of Hawaii and is part of the Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument. The Nature Conservancy has been running a marine lab there since 2005, the only site with housing and a runway for small aircraft located in one of the most untouched tropical marine ecosystems in the world. With 170 inches of rain a year — compared with 37 in Seattle — Palmyra also has a dense rain forest where 11 species of seabirds nest. Discoveries made there include a surprising link between fish and seabirds: a study found that nesting birds’ droppings carried onto the reef by the rain stimulated plankton growth that attracted manta rays and other plankton feeders. Other research has shown that the classic picture of a coral reef, with lots of pretty little fish and a few big ones, is entirely artificial. Palmyra’s reefs, like those in the other monuments, are dominated by sharks, snappers, jacks and other top predators, while smaller prey cower in fear in holes in the coral, a study found. So interconnected are the elements of intact reef communities that allowing fishing just beyond 12 miles would disrupt the ecosystem, said Alan Friedlander, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii and chief scientist of the National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas project. \"You need to keep the fishing as far away as possible, ideally at 200 miles,\" said Dr. Friedlander. Moreover, the remote locations are difficult to police. Many of the denizens of intact tropical reefs, like humphead parrotfish and wrasses, are worth thousands of dollars in Asia, said Dr. Richmond. \"Fishing them sustainably, as Wespac proposes, would mean traveling very long distances from Hawaii and taking very few fish,\" he said. \"It wouldn’t be economical.\" Dr. Richmond predicted that fishing vessels \"would poach the heck out of those islands.\" Daniel Pauly, a prominent fisheries scientist at the University of British Columbia, says that given a chance, the value of the bigger reserves like those around Wake and Johnston atolls and Jarvis Island, which extend to 200 miles offshore, will increase over time. Why? Evolution. Research by Jonathan A. Mee, a fish geneticist at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, suggests that in any large marine reserve, some \"lazy\" fish will spend their whole lives inside the boundaries and therefore will not be caught — and the bigger the reserve, the more fish inside it will live longer. This will raise the number of what scientists call B.O.F.F.s (Big Old Fecund Females), which produce more eggs and eggs of better quality, further increasing the density of fish inside the reserve. Dr. Mee believes that evolutionary selection of a putative \"lazy\" gene would accelerate the population growth inside a reserve. \"The bigger the mortality outside the reserve, the faster the population inside will grow,\" Dr. Mee said in an interview. This would be particularly helpful for bigeye tuna, which is the mainstay of the sushi market and the principal target of the Hawaii long-line fleet. The population of bigeye in the central and western Pacific is now estimated to be 16 percent of its original size. \"Technology and subsidies have allowed industrial fleets to go farther and farther, and deeper and deeper, and to deplete stock after stock,\" said Dr. Pauly, who has shown that the global catch is steadily falling. \"The only thing standing between these fleets and global depletion are these big no-take reserves, so this is the time to create more, not to open up the existing ones to fishing.\" Alex David Rogers, a conservation biologist and seamount expert at Oxford University, estimated that worldwide there were about 16,000 seamounts with summits above 5,000 feet, shallow enough to harbor a rich diversity of fish and corals. Unfortunately, he said, most have already been fished. Still those seamounts in the Papahānaumokuākea and Pacific Remote Islands marine monuments remain mostly pristine, said Chris Yesson, an expert on ocean floors at the Zoological Society of London. \"Saving the ones in the American marine monuments is extremely important, because the NW Pacific is particularly rich in endemic corals and other marine life,\" Dr. Rogers wrote in an email. Paul Achitoff, managing attorney for Earthjustice’s mid-Pacific office in Honolulu, said many legal scholars had concluded that the Antiquities Act, which allows presidents to designate and protect monuments without congressional approval, is a one-way street. \"It does not allow presidents to remove restrictions or protections from a previously designated monument,\" he said in an interview. \"Only Congress can do that.\" He acknowledged that several presidents had changed monument boundaries and tweaked restrictions without court challenges. That may change soon. \"If any of the protections to the Pacific marine monuments are lifted, we will be filing lawsuits, and we expect to win,\" Mr. Achitoff said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/science/trump-zinke-pacific-marine-reserves.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'What Experts Know About Men Who Rape', 'text': ' In 1976, a Ph.D. candidate at Claremont Graduate University placed a rather unusual personal ad in newspapers throughout Los Angeles: He sat by his phone, skeptical that it would ring. \"I didn’t think that anyone would want to respond,\" said Samuel D. Smithyman, now 72 and a clinical psychologist in South Carolina. But the phone did ring. Nearly 200 times. At the other end of the line were a computer programmer who had raped his \"sort of girlfriend,\" a painter who had raped his acquaintance’s wife, and a school custodian who described 10 to 15 rapes as a means of getting even with \"rich bastards\" in Beverly Hills. By the end of the summer, Dr. Smithyman had completed 50 interviews, which became the foundation for his dissertation: \"The Undetected Rapist.\" What was particularly surprising to him was how normal these men sounded and how diverse their backgrounds were. He concluded that few generalizations could be made. Over the past few weeks, women across the world have recounted tales of harassment and sexual assault by posting anecdotes to social media with the hashtag #MeToo. Even just focusing on the second category, the biographies of the accused are so varied that they seem to support Dr. Smithyman’s observation. But more recent research suggests that there are some commonalities. In the decades since his paper, scientists have been gradually filling out a picture of men who commit sexual assaults. The most pronounced similarities have little to do with the traditional demographic categories, like race, class and marital status. Rather, other kinds of patterns have emerged: these men begin early, studies find. They may associate with others who also commit sexual violence. They usually deny that they have raped women even as they admit to non-consensual sex. Clarifying these and other patterns, many researchers say, is the most realistic path toward curtailing behaviors that cause so much pain. \"If you don’t really understand perpetrators, you’re never going to understand sexual violence,\" said Sherry Hamby, editor of the journal Psychology of Violence. That may seem obvious, but she said she receives \"10 papers on victims\" for every one on perpetrators. This may be partly connected to a tendency to consider sexual assault a women’s issue even though men usually commit the crime. But finding the right subjects also has complicated the research. Early studies relied heavily on convicted rapists. This skewed the data, said Neil Malamuth, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been studying sexual aggression for decades. Men in prison are often \"generalists,\" he said: \"They would steal your television, your watch, your car. And sometimes they steal sex.\" But men who commit sexual assault, and are not imprisoned because they got away with it, are often \"specialists.\" There is a strong chance that this is their primary criminal transgression. More recent studies tend to rely on anonymous surveys of college students and other communities, which come with legal language assuring subjects their answers cannot be used against them. The studies avoid using terms such as \"rape\" and \"sexual assault.\" Instead, they ask subjects highly specific questions about their actions and tactics. The focus of most sexual aggression research is acknowledged non-consensual sexual behavior. In questionnaires and in follow-up interviews, subjects are surprisingly open about ignoring consent. Men who rape tend to start young, in high school or the first couple years of college, likely crossing a line with someone they know, the research suggests. Some of these men commit one or two sexual assaults and then stop. Others — no one can yet say what portion — maintain this behavior or even pick up the pace. Antonia Abbey, a social psychologist at Wayne State University, has found that young men who expressed remorse were less likely to offend the following year, while those who blamed their victim were more likely to do it again. One repeat offender put it this way: \"I felt I was repaying her for sexually arousing me.\" There is a heated debate among experts about whether there is a point at which sexual assault becomes an entrenched behavior and what percentage of assaults are committed by serial predators. Most researchers agree that the line between the occasional and frequent offender is not so clear. The recent work of Kevin Swartout, a professor of psychology and public health at Georgia State University, suggests that low-frequency offenders are more common on college campuses than previously thought. \"It’s a matter of degree, more like dosage,\" said Mary P. Koss, a professor of public health at the University of Arizona, who is credited with coining the term \"date rape.\" Dosage of what? Certain factors — researchers call them \"risk factors\" while acknowledging that these men are nonetheless responsible for their actions — have an outsize presence among those who commit sexual assaults. Heavy drinking, perceived pressure to have sex, a belief in \"rape myths\" — such as the idea that no means yes — are all risk factors among men who have committed sexual assault. A peer group that uses hostile language to describe women is another one. Yet there also seem to be personal attributes that have mediating effect on these factors. Men who are highly aroused by rape porn — another risk factor — are less likely to attempt sexual assault if they score highly on measures of empathy, Dr. Malamuth has found. Narcissism seems to work in the other direction, magnifying odds that men will commit sexual assault and rape. What about the idea that rape is about power over women? Some experts feel that research into hostile attitudes toward women supports this idea. In general, however, researchers say motives are varied and difficult to quantify. Dr. Malamuth has noticed that repeat offenders often tell similar stories of rejection in high school and of looking on as \"jocks and the football players got all the attractive women.\" As these once-unpopular, often narcissistic men become more successful, he suspects that \"getting back at these women, having power over them, seems to have become a source of arousal.\" Most subjects in these studies freely acknowledge non-consensual sex — but that does not mean they consider it real rape. Researchers encounter this contradiction again and again. Asked \"if they had penetrated against their consent,\" said Dr. Koss, the subject will say yes. Asked if he did \"something like rape,\" the answer is almost always no. Studies of incarcerated rapists — even men who admit to keeping sex slaves in conflict zones — find a similar disconnect. It’s not that they deny sexual assault happens; it’s just that the crime is committed by the monster over there. And this is not a sign that the respondents are psychopaths, said Dr. Hamby, the journal editor. It’s a sign that they are human. \"No one thinks they are a bad guy,\" she said. Indeed, experts note one last trait shared by men who have raped: they do not believe they are the problem.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/health/men-rape-sexual-assault.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'How Beets Became Beet-Red', 'text': ' As the seasons change, a riot of red shows up in the world around us, showcasing some of the most vivid hues that plant biochemistry can create. The red pigments in maple leaves, called anthocyanins, are the same kind that light up the cranberries you might cook for a Thanksgiving feast or the ruddy apples you’d put in a pie. But as you slide a tray of beets into the oven to roast, you’ll be seeing something that’s completely different at the molecular level. Beets, it turns out, have evolved another, separate way of being red. In a paper published in New Phytologist, biologists recently reported that they have discovered a key step in the evolution of this process, which not only helps explain the origins of a brilliant natural color, but could have uses far beyond brightening your dinner table. The pigments that give red beets their incandescent tint are called betalains. They’re made using an amino acid called tyrosine, the starting material for thousands of compounds made by plants. Plants modify tyrosine by adding other molecules to create an enormous array of useful substances. This is how morphine is made in the opium poppy, and mescaline in cactuses. Intrigued by this process, Hiroshi Maeda, a professor at University of Wisconsin and senior author on the paper, collaborated with beet experts to study how the plants make betalains from tyrosine. Right away they found something peculiar. A tyrosine-making enzyme, which in most plants gets turned off after a certain amount is made, stays on longer in beets and some related species, producing an overload of the amino acid. This, it turns out, is likely the pivotal change that gave beets the starting material they would need to develop their special red. At first, there would have been no use for the extra tyrosine. \"The plants are freaked out: ‘What should I do with this?’\" Dr. Maeda said. Eventually, however, some plants started to find a way to make something out of it. At a later stage in their evolutionary history, red beets developed enzymes that use the extra tyrosine to create the rich scarlet we know so well. Scientists do not know exactly why this ability helped beets thrive. While some research suggests betalains may help plants weather stress, perhaps their primary usefulness is that humans — and presumably other creatures, like pollinators — love the way they look, Dr. Maeda said. Beyond questions of color, the research has implications for medicine. While morphine is still produced in plantations of opium poppies, the discovery of an enzyme that increases the tyrosine used to make the painkilling molecule could have effects on how that drug and others are made. The team is working to see whether they can boost tyrosine levels in other plants by giving them the enzyme found in beets. Until then, you can thank beets and their betalains for the bright red shades in other things you might enjoy. The anthocyanins in strawberries, for instance, are not stable enough to be relied on as food coloring in certain products. \"If you look at the label very carefully on organic strawberry ice cream,\" Dr. Maeda said, \"often you find beet juice added.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/science/beets-red-enzymes.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'As Winter Sets In, Tiny Shrews Shrink Their Skulls and Brains', 'text': ' Bad news, bears. Hibernation is no longer the coolest thing animals do to survive the winter. As cold weather approaches, tiny mole-like creatures known as red-toothed shrews will shrink their own heads, reducing their skull and brain mass by as much as 20 percent, according to new research published Monday in Current Biology. When warm weather returns, they will regrow the region nearly to its original size, giving new meaning to the phrase \"spring ahead.\" Though it is not yet clear why the shrews go down a few sizes for the winter, the authors of the study speculate that the reduced head and brain size helps them conserve energy when resources are scarce. \"These tiny mammals cannot migrate long distances to avoid winter, nor can they enter any kind of energy-saving state\" like hibernation, said Javier Lazaro, a doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany and an author of the study. They also have high metabolic rates and very little fat stored in their bodies. \"Therefore, they starve within a few hours if they do not hunt constantly.\" The researchers say the shrinkage is a survival strategy. \"Brain tissue is energetically very expensive, so reducing overall brain size might decrease energy demands and thus food requirements,\" he said. The shrews’ reduction in size doesn’t only affect the head. Several major organs lose mass in winter, and the spine shortens, as well. Overall, the shrews in the study reduced their body mass by about 18 percent from July to February. Previous research had hinted that all shrew species might undergo a reduction in body and head mass during the winter. There is even a term for it, Dehnel’s Phenomenon, named after the Polish zoologist who conducted that research, August Dehnel. But previous studies only demonstrated the effect across whole populations of the small mammals, leaving open the possibility that larger-headed shrews were dying off in winter, reducing the average head size of the spring shrew populace. To study individual shrews, the researchers used live traps to capture the animals in Germany from summer 2014 to fall 2015. The captured shrews were X-rayed and implanted with a microchip. Twelve shrews were captured and measured at three distinct intervals, each of them displaying the same pattern: a peak head size in summer, a cranial reduction in winter and then regrowth in spring. About the size of a mouse and found in nearly all regions of the world, shrews are often mistaken for rodents, but are more closely related to moles. Exactly how a shrew shrinks its brain is still something of a head-scratcher. Changes in cranial size tend to be \"unidirectional and finite\" in vertebrates, the study notes. But there is evidence that the shrew’s brain case shrinks when the joints between the bones of the skull reabsorb tissue during autumn and winter. As spring approaches, the bone tissue regenerates. The researchers could not say how the reduced brain size might affect the shrew’s cognitive abilities, and plan future research to learn more. Knowing that a mammal can successfully shrink and regrow its own body — especially a complex organ like the brain — could open up exciting new avenues for exploration. Mr. Lazaro said that his team had already been approached by medical researchers with an interest in bone and joint diseases. The findings \"could mean an important advance for the study of degenerative bone diseases such as osteoporosis,\" he said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/science/shrews-shrink-heads-brains.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Uncovering an Overlooked Source for Iconic Alabaster Statues', 'text': ' Medieval and Renaissance sculptors carved gorgeous statues and religious icons from alabaster, a soft, creamy white stone similar to marble. Much of their work, from visages of the Virgin Mary to angels slaying demons, now reside in museums like the Louvre in Paris and others across Europe. But a mystery remains: Where did the alabaster come from? \"This is quite a frustration for museum art historians to have question marks everywhere,\" said Wolfram Kloppmann, a geochemist at the French Geological Survey. In a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Kloppmann and a team of art historians, geologists and geochemists traced the origins of more than 60 alabaster statue. While many came from known quarries in England and Spain, the analysis of the stone also revealed an overlooked hub for alabaster production in the western French Alps. The site was a much richer source of the mineral than previously thought. The researchers’ work helped reconstruct an art trade route that existed across western Europe from the 12th to 17th centuries. \"This gives a picture of Medieval Europe in details we didn’t suspect before,\" Dr. Kloppmann said. The team asked museums and galleries across Europe and in the United States if they could take samples from their alabaster artwork for chemical analysis. They all said yes, allowing the team to investigate the origins of several royal and papal tomb figures, as well as the 14th century Carrying of the Cross from the Louvre, the 14th century the Archangel Gabriel from an Annunciation Group from the Cleveland Museum of Art and a 17th century seated greyhound originally from a gallery in London. But the team had to collect samples as carefully as possible to avoid scarring the priceless works of art. They could not drill. They could not scrape. Instead, they used a tiny chisel to collect just a flake that measured only two millimeters from the base or rear of each statue. At their lab, the scientists analyzed the flakes for sulfur, oxygen and strontium isotopes. Such signatures are fingerprints that made it possible to match the flakes to their original alabaster quarries. Of the 66 samples, 15 came from a quarry in the English Midlands to the west of Nottingham and three came from northern Spain. Both were historically well-known as centers for the alabaster trade. The \"alabastermen\" of the English Midlands are believed to have provided the material from the 12th century until 1550 when religious icons were banned during a period of civil and religious turmoil in Britain known as the English Reformation, when the Church of England broke away from the Roman Catholic Church. Many of the works were destroyed in this  period. Shiploads of alabaster artwork escaped the furnaces and were sent to France. This exchange was long thought to be one of the primary sources of the country’s alabaster. But to the team’s surprise more than 20 of the statues they analyzed originated from near Notre-Dame-de-Mésage in the western French Alps. The quarry there operated for more than five centuries, supplying material for some of western Europe’s most important artworks. \"We did not know that this was really a major source of alabaster in western Europe,\" said Dr. Kloppmann. \"We discovered the French part of the story.\" Jane A. Evans, an isotope geochemist from the British Geological Survey who was not involved in the study, called the paper \"well-constructed\" and said the technique \"could be extended to look at a wider range of carvings from differing periods, and they could extend their fingerprinting methods to incorporate other isotope and geochemical methods.\" Dr. Kloppmann said the next steps for their work is to analyze alabaster in Germany, Poland and Italy and perhaps from ancient Mesopotamia, as well as use their technique to detect alabaster fakes.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/science/alabaster-statues-medieval-europe.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Wild and Captive Chimpanzees Share Personality Traits With Humans', 'text': ' In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Jane Goodall started attributing personalities to the chimpanzees she followed in Gombe National Park in what is now Tanzania. In her descriptions, some were more playful or aggressive, affectionate or nurturing. Many scientists at the time were horrified, she recalled. Considered an amateur — she didn’t yet have her Ph.D. — they contended she was inventing personality traits for animals. Dr. Goodall, now 83, said in a phone interview on Monday from her home in England that scientists thought \"I was guilty of the worst kind of anthropomorphism.\" But time has borne out her insights. Chimpanzees in the wild have personalities similar to those in captivity, and both strongly overlap with traits that are familiar in humans, a new study published in Scientific Data confirms. The new examination of chimpanzees at Gombe updates personality research conducted on 24 animals in 1973 to include more than 100 additional chimps that were evaluated a few years ago. The animals were individually assessed by graduate students in the earlier study, and in the latest by Tanzanian field assistants, on personality traits like agreeableness, extroversion, depression, aggression and self-control. Researchers used different questionnaires to assess the chimps’ traits in the two studies, but most of the personality types were consistent across the two studies. These traits seen among wild chimps matched ones seen among captive animals, the study found, and are similar to those described in people. Dr. Goodall, who is promoting a new documentary, \"Jane,\" about those early days of her research, said she’s not surprised. She knew from childhood experiences with guinea pigs, tortoises and her favorite dog, Rusty, that animals have personalities that are quite familiar. \"I honestly don’t think you can be close to any animals and not realize their very vivid personalities,\" she said. Clive Wynne, a professor and director of the Canine Science Collaboratory at Arizona State University in Tempe, who was not involved in the research, said the new study offered a \"really rich picture\" of the overlap among species. \"It’s backing up and reinforcing a number of things that we assume about animal personality that are seldom established with this degree of security in substantial wild-living populations,\" said Dr. Wynne, who concurs that dogs, his area of specialty, also have similar personality traits. Robert Latzman, an associate professor at Georgia State University, who was not involved in the study, said his research with chimpanzees in zoos has always left open the question of whether animals in the wild are somehow different. \"What’s exciting about these data is there’s some suggestion that wild apes look very similar to what we would expect in terms of basic dispositional traits and continuity of those traits — and I don’t mean just to captive chimpanzees, but to humans,\" he said. \"The work in the wild underscores how similar these animals truly are to humans.\" Alexander Weiss, who led the new study, said he was particularly interested in examining the personality traits of animals in the wild. His findings were in line with previous research he’s done on chimpanzees in captivity. \"The fact that we’re showing this consistency in the wild is nice, because it allows us to draw more general conclusions,\" said Dr. Weiss, a senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. \"It’s not just being in a zoo that’s causing these individual traits to be stable.\" The study’s underlying data will be made publicly available so other scientists can use them in their own research, he said. Although most of the animals tested in 1973 had died by the time the recent analysis was conducted, the study also concluded that an animal’s personality traits were generally consistent over time. Dr. Goodall said that fits what she’s seen, too. She only visits Gombe twice a year now, and only two animals are still alive from the days when she knew them as individuals. One, a mother of twins named Gremlin, has changed a bit, Dr. Goodall said. \"I think the main difference in her personality is she’s become more confident as she gets older, just like people do,\" she said. Dr. Goodall added that she’s pleased that researchers are still finding so much of interest at Gombe, and tapping into the expertise of Tanzanian field workers. And, of course, she’s happy that the academic perspective has shifted from the time when she was told only humans had personalities, minds and emotions. \"Today you can get your Ph.D. studying animal personality. I think we’ve come around full-cycle,\" she said. \"It absolutely vindicates all that I’ve ever believed.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/science/chimpanzees-goodall.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Yes, Oysters Can ‘Hear.’ They Probably Wish We’d Clam Up.', 'text': ' Like anyone with rowdy neighbors, oysters may be feeling stressed thanks to the growing problem of underwater noise pollution, and are trying to filter out the racket. New research published Wednesday in PLoS One reveals that oysters will close their shells when exposed to noises along a range of frequencies that includes the sounds emitted by known noise polluters like cargo ships and underwater oil exploration. In oysters, closed shells are an indicator of distress. Under optimal conditions, bivalve mollusks will keep their shells open, and are thought to shut them only when feeling stressed or threatened. Clamping their shells to screen out noise pollution or other artificial irritants could prevent oysters from perceiving important biological cues, said the authors of the study. Oysters \"must be able to hear breaking waves and water currents,\" which could trigger their biological rhythms, said Jean-Charles Massabuau, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research and an author of the study. \"To hear the current arriving could prepare them for eating and digesting, possibly as when we hear and smell that somebody is preparing dinner.\" Not being able to detect other natural events, like rainfall or thunderstorms, could also prevent them from knowing when it’s time to spawn, Dr. Massabuau said. Noise pollution has been a growing problem in the oceans and other large bodies of water for decades. Commercial shipping, oil exploration, recreation and even scientific research are all raising the decibel levels within marine habitats, adding to naturally occurring rackets like earthquakes, crashing waves and tidal changes. And because sound travels farther in water than air, each new source has an outsize effect. Such noise has already been shown to have adverse effects in fish, whales and other marine mammals as well as cephalopods. But little is known about its effects on most invertebrates. To see whether oysters were bothered by noise pollution — or whether they could perceive sound at all — the researchers used underwater speakers to expose 32 Pacific oysters in a tank to a wide range of noise frequencies. The oysters closed their shells when exposed to the low frequencies made by cargo ships, wind turbines, pile driving, man-made explosions and seismic research. The higher pitched noises produced by Jet Skis and small recreational boats were not in the range of frequencies that affected the oysters. The study should alert biologists and environmentalists that the dangers of marine noise pollution might be more widespread than previously believed, Dr. Massabuau said. \"We must think that noise pollution could affect many more animals that we thought,\" he said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/science/oysters-noise-pollution.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Ancient Skull May Be History’s Earliest Known Tsunami Victim', 'text': ' In 1929, an Australian geologist named Paul S. Hossfeld was investigating the northern coast of Papua New Guinea for petroleum. He found bone fragments embedded in a creek bank about seven miles inland and about 170 feet above sea level. At first, Dr. Hossfeld believed that the specimen was from the skull of Homo erectus, an extinct relative of modern humans. Later analysis would show it belonged to a modern human who lived about 6,000 years ago. Now recent research suggests the remains — known as the Aitape skull — could be something more: the earliest known victim of a tsunami. The findings, published Wednesday in the journal PLoS One, may offer useful historical context for how ancient humans living along the Pacific Ocean’s coasts faced fierce natural hazards. \"Here we start to see human interaction with some nasty earthquakes and tsunamis,\" said James Goff, a retired geologist at the University of New South Wales Sydney and author of the study. Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern half of a large, bountiful island just north of Australia (the western side is part of Indonesia). In 1998, after decades of relative geological quiet, a devastating tsunami rocked the country, killing more than 2,000 people. \"This huge volume of water struck the coast and swept away everything,\" said John Terrell, an anthropologist at the Field Museum in Chicago who has completed research in the country and is a co-author on the paper. \"The villages I knew and loved were sheared off.\" Following the tsunami, Dr. Goff and some colleagues went to the country to assess the damage. The visit helped spark his interest in investigating whether there was a link between ancient tsunamis and the Aitape skull. After struggling for almost two decades to get funding for the project, he returned to the island in 2014 to explore the rain forests and crystal clear creek where Dr. Hossfeld had discovered the skull 85 years earlier. Dr. Hossfeld had left detailed notes about where he had found the skull, which helped guide Dr. Goff and his team as they collected samples from the same sediment layer at a nearby river-cut cliff. Back at the lab, they performed geochemical analysis to determine whether the sediment level had been deposited by a tsunami 6,000 years ago. Because they had previously analyzed geochemical signals from sediment on the island following the 1998 tsunami, the team knew which clues to look for, like grain size and composition. They found that the sediment collected from the skull site contained fossilized deep sea diatoms. These microscopic organisms were a telltale sign that ocean water had drowned the area at some point. The researchers also found geochemical signals that matched the signatures they collected in 1998, offering additional evidence that a tsunami had struck around 6,000 years ago. \"Bang! Right where the diatoms were looking very sexy and you’re getting excited, you have a signal that says, ‘Hi, I’m seawater,’\" said Dr. Goff. He said the findings checked all the boxes for a tragic tsunami tale. \"Yes, this was a tsunami. And yes, this is most probably a tsunami victim, and he or she is the oldest one we know.\" Sue Dawson, a geographer the University of Dundee in Scotland who studies tsunami sedimentation, said that the team’s diatom evidence was similar to what she found examining sediments in Papua New Guinea after the 1998 tsunami and could be suggestive of a tsunami flooding the area. But she added that the findings do not rule out that the skull could have belonged to someone who died before the tsunami occurred and whose grave was disturbed by the event. Ethan Cochrane, an archaeologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and an author of the paper, questioned that alternative scenario. \"Tsunamis do not rip up the ground enough to remove already buried bodies and put them into suspension and transport them,\" he said, pointing to findings from rescue efforts with recent tsunamis. \"Overwhelmingly, the dead you find were killed by the tsunami.\" The geochemistry analysis supported the authors’ conclusions, another scientist not involved in the study said, although he added that it didn’t contribute much to our understanding of the dangers posed by tsunamis. \"It is more of an intriguing geological snapshot of an ancient catastrophic event,\" said Iain Stewart, a geologist at the University of Plymouth in England.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/science/skull-tsunami-victim.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'One Last Question Before the Operation: Just How Frail Are You?', 'text': ' Earlier this month, Dr. Thomas Robinson, a general surgeon at the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center, saw a patient in his mid 80s. The man had gallstones that caused infections, with abdominal pain severe enough to send him to an emergency room every couple of months. The surgical solution to this problem is usually clear: Remove the gallbladder with a procedure called a cholecystectomy. \"In a 60-year-old, chances are it’s an outpatient operation,\" Dr. Robinson said. In this case, though, he hesitated. Like a growing number of surgeons, he wanted to know, before presenting the options, whether his patient was frail. In geriatrics, frail is not merely an adjective. A syndrome marked by slowness, weakness, fatigue and often weight loss, frailty tells doctors a lot about their patients’ likely futures. It can, for example, predict how well older patients rebound from physical stresses — like surgery. \"Some 86-year-olds live independently and are really healthy, and we take out their gallbladders all the time,\" Dr. Robinson told me. But this patient, a nursing home resident who also had heart disease and pulmonary disease, scored moderately to highly frail on a commonly used index. In particular, the man flunked what’s called the \"timed up-and-go,\" which measures how long it takes someone to rise from a chair, walk 10 feet, turn around, walk back and sit down again. Along with other frailty measures, that meant that \"surgery is not going to go very well,\" Dr. Robinson said. In a frank half-hour conversation, he explained to his patient that he faced a 30 to 40 percent risk of dying from the surgery. If he survived, he probably would endure a long, difficult recovery and might not regain the functional abilities he had now. Dilemmas like these will grow more common as the population ages. Already, more than a third of inpatient surgical procedures are performed on patients over age 65. But about 15 percent of the older population, excluding nursing home residents, meets the criteria for frailty, rising to more than a third of those over age 85. \"There’s a much higher prevalence in the Deep South and among African Americans,\" said Dr. Jeremy Walston, principal investigator at the Older Americans Independence Center at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Geriatricians like Dr. Walston have been publishing research on frailty for nearly 20 years, as measured by tools developed at Johns Hopkins or by a Canadian group, and variants thereof. The Hopkins approach uses tests like grip strength and walking speed; the Canadian index relies on health deficits, including chronic illnesses and dementia. Both assessments do a good job of identifying patients vulnerable to health problems, regardless of chronological age. A British group has used meta-analyses, for instance, to show that frail older adults are more prone to falls, fractures, hospitalizations, dementia and nursing home placement. In the United States, though, \"it’s the surgeons who have picked up the banner,\" Dr. Walston said. They’re starting to use frailty to help make decisions about which procedures make sense for which older patients. You can see why: Frailty involves decreased physiological reserve, which helps determine how patients respond to physical stress. Surgery brings plenty of that, said Dr. Carolyn Seib, a general and endocrine surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco. The effects of anesthesia and inflammation, the risk of blood clots or infection, muscle weakness caused by days in bed — all can take a toll. \"The more frail a patient is, the higher the risk of complications,\" Dr. Seib said. Researchers have shown that after major operations — including cardiac and colon cancer surgery and kidney transplants — frail older patients are more prone than others to longer hospital stays, being readmitted within a month of a procedure and winding up in nursing homes after they’re discharged. They’re also more likely to die. But a study that Dr. Seib and her colleagues published in JAMA Surgery this month shows that frail seniors face higher complications even after ambulatory surgery, outpatient procedures often considered routine. Hernia repairs, thyroid or parathyroid surgery, operations for breast cancer — \"patients and providers often don’t think twice about these,\" Dr. Seib said. Yet when the researchers looked at 141,000 patients over age 40 in a national surgical database, they found that serious complications were two to four times higher in patients with moderate to high frailty, although complication rates overall were low (1.7 percent, with .7 percent experiencing serious complications). \"We have to take frailty into account for any operation, big or small,\" Dr. Seib said. Although surgeons increasingly screen for frailty, \"I wouldn’t say it’s routine yet,\" she added. So she and other researchers recommend that before an operation, patients and families ask: Is my mother showing signs of frailty? Should we do an assessment that indicates how frail she might be? Unlike some conditions, frailty is something patients and doctors can actually do something about. \"There are interventions that can improve or even resolve it,\" said Dr. Linda Fried, dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and a pioneer in frailty research. First, many surgical centers offer a \"prehabilitation\" program, shown to improve patients’ results through exercise, better nutrition and smoking cessation. Undertaken even for a few weeks before an operation, \"it improves your bounce-back capability,\" Dr. Fried said. Physical activity, in particular, \"seems to be the key to preventing frailty and its progression,\" Dr. Fried added — even for those not contemplating surgery. Second, surgical decision-making is not a binary choice between patients agreeing to the standard operation or doing nothing. Alerted to frailty, a surgeon might opt for a less aggressive approach or a different kind of anesthesia. A patient, understanding that she may be looking at an altered future even if the surgery fixes the physical problem, will have her own priorities to weigh. With frailty, \"I’m going to counsel the patient differently,\" Dr. Robinson said. \"Maybe change the surgery I do. Maybe find an alternative. There’s a spectrum of possibilities.\" Take his patient with gallstone disease. After their discussion, the man decided that instead of undergoing what would be, for him, a high-risk operation, he would go home and try to avoid foods that triggered his symptoms. If the pain flared again, Dr. Robinson would insert a tube through his skin to drain the gallbladder, a much safer procedure. Because the tube, and the bag into which it drained, would be permanent, it might not represent a welcome alternative for a healthier patient. But \"for a physiologically vulnerable older adult,\" Dr. Robinson said, \"it’s a whole different equation.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/health/elderly-surgery-frailty.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Volcanoes Helped Violent Revolts Erupt in Ancient Egypt', 'text': ' The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a prosperous time in Egypt’s ancient history, nearly three centuries from 305 B.C. to 30 B.C. that saw the reign of Queen Cleopatra VII and the construction of the Great Library and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. But during the period there were also several bloody Egyptian revolts against the ruling Greeks. Now, a team of historians and climate scientists say in a study published Tuesday that the unrest and uprisings may have been tied to volcanic eruptions that triggered climatic changes. Eruptions across the globe may have suppressed monsoons, the scientists said, diminishing the annual river floods and leading to food shortages. Because 70 percent of the world’s population today similarly relies on monsoon-dependent agricultural systems, the findings may warn of what might happen in a volcanically active future. Today, humanity lives during a relatively quiet volcanic period. The largest eruption to affect the climate in recent memory was the 1991 Pinatubo event in the Philippines. But things were much different during the Ptolemaic era. \"They might have been dealing with two or even three huge volcanic eruptions occurring in a given decade,\" said Francis Ludlow, a climate historian at Trinity College Dublin and an author of the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. \"They were unfortunate. They were living in a period where the Nile had extra variability because of these eruptions.\" When powerful volcanoes erupt, they spew ash and sulfur high into the stratosphere. There, the sulfur oxidizes into sulfate aerosols that reflect sunlight back to space, reducing evaporation on the planet’s surface. As less water is absorbed into the clouds, less rain falls into seas and lakes. And if a volcano erupts in the Northern Hemisphere, especially at high latitudes, the cooling effect may tamper with the summertime heating that controls monsoon winds over Africa. When rainfall is reduced and monsoons are suppressed, the Nile fails to flood as usual, starving the crops that depend on its water. \"We guess there was a lot of fear when the Egyptians see the Nile not flooding that year,\" said Joseph Manning, a historian from Yale and co-author on the study. \"There was fear about what’s going to happen. ‘Are we going to starve like last time when there was no flood three years in a row?’\" That fear could have fueled riots. But to establish a connection between volcanoes and revolts in ancient Egypt, the team first had to determine the dates for when the volcanoes erupted. They did that by looking at ice core data from Greenland and Antarctica, which contain trapped sulfur from ancient volcanic eruptions. The scientists then turned to papyrus records to figure out when the Nile River failed to flood as usual. But the records from the Ptolemaic period were all qualitative, not quantitative. So the team turned to the Nilometer record, which contains measurements taken by large instruments built during Egypt’s early Islamic period to monitor the Nile River’s annual flood level. The researchers used the data from the Nilometer record to gain measurements from 622 A.D. to 1902 A.D., and identified 60 eruptions between those years. On average the Nile flood level was nearly nine inches lower during eruption years, the team discovered. This suggested a pattern that may have existed during the Ptolemaic Period, as well. After confirming a link between volcanic eruptions and poor Nile flooding, the team then matched the dates of Ptolemaic eruptions with papyrus records of well-known rebellions. They found that eight of ten large uprisings happened within two years of a volcanic eruption. The biggest of these, the 20-year Theban revolt, began in 207 B.C., followed a large tropical eruption two years earlier. A papyrus report from this time indicated that most of the farmers were killed and the land had gone dry. In their paper, the researchers were careful to clarify that volcanoes alone were not the cause of Egyptian revolts. Rather, the natural disasters set off a reaction that mixed other ingredients — like heavy taxation, ethnic conflict and disease — to incite social unrest. \"You have all of these things coalescing at a time, and you can imagine it’s a powder keg,\" said Dr. Ludlow. \"All of it puts a strain on the social system and can just ignite into revolt against the Ptolemaic Greek elites.\" Not every eruption in that period was linked to a revolt. The river failed to flood in the years following massive eruptions in 46 and 44 B.C. during Cleopatra’s reign, but her food allocation policies may have helped avert uprisings. Kyle Harper, a professor of classics at the University of Oklahoma who has studied environmental change and the fall of the Roman Empire, said the new paper was compelling and that it showed a strong link between volcanic forces and their effects on the Nile River. He added that he would like to see if the analysis could be extended to Egypt’s Roman and early Islamic periods. But Kevin Anchukaitis, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona, said that the study had some shortcomings. For instance, he called the variability in the Nile River flooding during eruption years relatively small. The study also did not account for weather effects like El Niño during that period, he said. Dr. Ludlow responded by saying that the study shows that the flood levels are consistently lower following eruptions, and that larger eruptions produced a correspondingly greater drop in flood levels. To Michael McCormick, a professor of history at Harvard, the study offers a note of caution as we face climatic changes in the future. \"It really gives us pause for the future because volcanic eruptions will continue, and they will come at unpredictable times,\" Dr. McCormick said. \"It is sobering to see how this may have had an effect on a very productive economy in the ancient world, and we need to reflect on how it may affect us.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/science/volcanoes-ancient-egypt-revolts.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Jewish Philanthropists Create a Prize for Christian Missionaries', 'text': ' Christian missionary hospitals in Africa, which provide much of the continent’s medical care but are often desperately short of both cash and doctors, are now competing for a major award: a $500,000 prize created specifically for them by a Jewish businessman-philanthropist and his wife, a rabbi. The L’Chaim Prize for Outstanding Christian Medical Missionary Service was founded last year by Mark and Erica Gerson. L’chaim is typically translated as \"to life.\" But it \"really means ‘to lives’ — it’s plural,\" argued Mr. Gerson. \"There’s no such thing as a Jewish life lived alone.\" \"The Torah tells us 36 times to ‘love the stranger,’\" he added, \"and who is more of a stranger than the African poor? These moral superheroes sacrifice everything to serve them.\" Last year’s initial award went to Dr. Jason Fader, a surgeon at Kibuye Hope Hospital in rural Burundi. Dr. Fader, an American, is one of only 14 surgeons in Burundi and the only one based outside the capital, Bujumbura. The tiny country is one of the world’s poorest and suffers from the same ethnic divisions and political violence that led to the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda. The money, according to the African Mission Healthcare Foundation, which oversees the award, is paying for a new surgical building and refurbished laboratory, where local medical students will be trained in surgery, and also for operations and prosthetics to help 350 people walk again. This year’s prize will go to Dr. Russell E. White, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Tenwek Hospital in western Kenya. Thousands of Kenyans have heart valves scarred by rheumatic heart disease, which hardly exists in wealthy countries with ready access to antibiotics but is common in poor nations. The valve damage, which can be debilitating or fatal, typically emerges years after a child’s routine strep throat has gone untreated. The money will be used to train cardiac surgeons to repair valves and to treat esophageal cancer and complications of tuberculosis, as well as other common local ailments. It will also pay for ultrasound screening in schools and for antibiotics for students whose strep infections have not yet damaged their hearts. Mr. Gerson began raising money in 2002 when a college friend, Dr. Jon Fielder, worked in a missionary hospital in Kenya and described an overwhelming dilemma: \"Faith-based\" institutions provide 20 to 50 percent of all medical care in Africa — estimates vary — but the American and European congregations that once supported mission hospitals have shrunk. The doctors who staff these facilities struggle to buy modern equipment, but every day they spend away raising money means dozens of patients go unseen. With the money he makes through the Gerson Lehrman Group, which pairs experts and investors seeking advice, Mr. Gerson also supports United Hatzalah in Israel, a network of 3,500 motorcyle-riding volunteer paramedics who whip through traffic faster than ambulances can. The new award, he hopes, \"will galvanize attention around what these superheroes do.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/health/missionary-hospitals-africa-prize.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'The Stripes in a Cat’s Whiskers', 'text': ' Q. How come my cat’s whiskers are striped, with bands of white and brown on each one? How does the pigment change like that as a single whisker grows? A. This banding pattern is typically associated with the agouti gene, which also produces banding in ordinary fur in some cats, said Robert A. Grahn of the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the University of California, Davis. But cat whiskers do not seem to follow the same pigmentation patterns observed in other hair types. In regular fur, the agouti gene controls the production of granules that carry pigment, speeding it up and slowing it down so that an individual strand winds up with light and dark bands. This produces so-called ticked coats, seen in many tabbies and Abyssinian cats. The difference in pigmentation patterns for whiskers is likely due to more complicated development patterns and physiology, he said. The location of the whisker root is deep in the skin and is associated with a special blood supply and sensory nerves. This structure allows a cat to use its whiskers to sense things, like clearance in tight places and even slight breezes. Dr. Grahn said he had not personally observed the described banding pattern in whiskers, but had not looked for it. He said he had seen whiskers in which the pigment switches part way through the growth cycle, as well as cats with both black and white whiskers. \"In the end, the genetics underlying the pigmentation of cat whiskers, while interesting, has not garnered significant research efforts,\" Dr. Grahn said.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/science/cats-whiskers.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Women Are More Likely to Address High Blood Pressure', 'text': ' Hypertension is dangerous. High blood pressure damages the inner lining of the arteries, limits the ability of the heart to pump blood and strains the organ in a way that can lead to heart failure. The condition increases the risk for stroke and vascular dementia, and hypertension is one of the most common causes of kidney failure. It impairs vision by damaging the blood vessels in the eyes. But the disease usually has no symptoms, and of the 29 percent of Americans who have high blood pressure, fewer than half have it under control. The prevalence of hypertension was unchanged from 1999 to 2016, according to a new report from the National Center for Health Statistics. The rate of controlled hypertension — people taking medicine to lower it — increased from 1999 to 2010, but was unchanged through 2016. \"We monitor the trends and provide the statistical information,\" said the lead author of the report, Cheryl D. Fryar, a statistician with the center. \"The policy makers and health care people can make their decisions. This is a guide to the next step.\" Men and women over age 18 have similar rates of hypertension. Men have somewhat higher rates at younger ages, but after age 60, prevalence among women is 66.8 percent, compared with 58.5 percent among men. Within the adult population that had the disease, the prevalence of controlled hypertension was 48.3 percent, and it increased with age. But women were more apt than men to control their blood pressure. Among those aged 18 to 39, women had a 62.6 percent rate of controlled hypertension, compared with 15.5 percent among men. At 60 and older, rates did not differ by sex. According to Dr. Peter Muennig, a professor of health policy and management at Columbia University who was not involved in the report, younger men take more risks than women in general. Although men are diagnosed with hypertension at similar rates, they are less likely to take the necessary medication. Rates of hypertension were higher among black men and women than among other races and ethnicities. While non-Hispanic blacks had a prevalence of 40.3 percent, whites had a 27.8 percent rate, the same as that among Hispanics. Prevalence was 25 percent among Asians. Even though there are effective treatments, lowering blood pressure can be challenging. \"It’s difficult for people to take medicine every day,\" Dr. Muennig said. \"And even if they do, it’s hard to control blood pressure — dosages vary, multiple medicines are often necessary, they have unpleasant side effects.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/health/high-blood-pressure.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Many Academics Are Eager to Publish in Worthless Journals', 'text': ' Call it a classic case of supply meeting demand. Universities, colleges, even community colleges insist that faculty publish scholarly research, and the more papers the better. Academics and the schools they teach at rely on these publications to bolster their reputations, and with an oversupply of Ph.D.’s vying for jobs, careers hang in the balance. Competition is fierce to get published in leading journals. But what about the overworked professors at less prestigious schools and community colleges, without big grants and state-of-the-art labs? How do they get ahead? As it turns out, many of their articles are appearing in \"journals\" that will publish almost anything, for fees that can range into the hundreds of dollars per paper. These publications often are called predatory journals, on the assumption that well-meaning academics are duped into working with them — tricked by flattering emails from the journals inviting them to submit a paper or fooled by a name that sounded like a journal they knew. But it’s increasingly clear that many academics know exactly what they’re getting into, which explains why these journals have proliferated despite wide criticism. The relationship is less predator and prey, some experts say, than a new and ugly symbiosis. Many faculty members — especially at schools where the teaching load is heavy and resources few — have become eager participants in what experts call academic fraud that wastes taxpayer money, chips away at scientific credibility, and muddies important research. \"When hundreds of thousands of publications appear in predatory journals, it stretches credulity to believe all the authors and universities they work for are victims,\" Derek Pyne, an economics professor at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia, wrote in a op-ed published in the Ottawa Citizen, a Canadian newspaper. The number of such journals has exploded to more than 10,000 in recent years, with nearly as many predatory as legitimate ones. \"Predatory publishing is becoming an organized industry,\" wrote one group of critics in a paper in Nature. Many of these journals have names that closely resemble those of established publications, making them easily mistakable. There is the Journal of Economics and Finance, published by Springer, but now also the Journal of Finance and Economics. There is the Journal of Engineering Technology, put out by the American Society for Engineering Education, but now another called the GSTF Journal of Engineering Technology. Predatory journals have few expenses, since they do not seriously review papers that are submitted and they publish only online. They blast emails to academics, inviting them to publish. And the journals often advertise on their websites that they are indexed by Google Scholar. Often that is correct — but Google Scholar does not vet the journals it indexes. The journals are giving rise to a wider ecosystem of pseudo science. For the academic who wants to add credentials to a résumé, for instance, publishers also hold meetings where, for a hefty fee, you can be listed as a presenter — whether you actually attend the meeting or not. One of those meetings, held in New York in June by a group called the World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, seemed more like a Potemkin village. On the publisher’s website, the convention promised to be large and lavish. But when I visited, the only venue was a small windowless room on the sixth floor of a hotel undergoing renovation. A handful of people sat in the room, diligently listening to a talk. Most who were listed on the program were not in attendance. Participating in such dubious enterprises carries few risks. Dr. Pyne, who did a study of his colleagues’ publications, reports that faculty members at his school who got promoted last year had at least four papers in questionable journals. All but one academic in 10 who won a School of Business and Economics award had published papers in these journals. One had 10 such articles. Academics get rewarded with promotions when they stuff their résumés with articles like these, Dr. Pyne concluded. There are few or no adverse consequences — in fact, the rewards for publishing in predatory journals were greater than for publishing in legitimate ones. Dr. Pyne does not know what role those studies played in the promotions. But, he said, \"I can say that such publications do not seem to hurt promotion prospects.\" Tensions over this kind of scholarship have spilled over Queensborough Community College, part of CUNY, the City University of New York. Although it is hardly known for its research, college administrators urge the faculty to publish. Recently a group of concerned professors complained that nearly a dozen colleagues have repeatedly published in at least one of the dubious journals — and have been promoted and rewarded for it. Noting that a number of these papers apparently depended on federal and city funds, the professors brought the matter to the attention of the vice chancellor for research and even wrote to the New York State inspector general’s office. The school referred inquiries to its head librarian, Jeanne Galvin. \"Just as with many colleges, faculty submit their work for publication in a variety of journals based on individual judgment,\" she said in an email. \"Queensborough offers several advisory resources, such as workshops and individual consultation with expert librarians. The research that I have seen published by our faculty is of the highest quality.\" Some say the academic system bears much of the blame for the rise of predatory journals, demanding publications even from teachers at places without real resources for research and where they may have little time apart from teaching. At Queensborough, faculty members typically teach nine courses per year. At four-year colleges, faculty may teach four to six courses a year. Yet \"every university requires some level of publication,\" said Lawrence DiPaolo, vice president of academic affairs at Neumann University in Aston, Pa. Recently a group of researchers invented a fake academic: Anna O. Szust. The name in Polish means fraudster. Dr. Szust applied to legitimate and predatory journals asking to be an editor. She supplied a résumé in which her publications and degrees were total fabrications, as were the names of the publishers of the books she said she had contributed to. The legitimate journals rejected her application immediately. But 48 out of 360 questionable journals made her an editor. Four made her editor in chief. One journal sent her an email saying, \"It’s our pleasure to add your name as our editor in chief for the journal with no responsibilities.\" The lead author of the Dr. Szust sting operation, Katarzyna Pisanski, a psychologist at the University of Sussex in England, said the question of what motivates people to publish in such journals \"is a touchy subject.\" \"If you were tricked by spam email you might not want to admit it, and if you did it wittingly to increase your publication counts you might also not want to admit it,\" she said in an email. The consequences of participating can be more than just a résumé freckled with poor-quality papers and meeting abstracts. Publications become part of the body of scientific literature. There are indications that some academic institutions are beginning to wise up to the dangers. Dewayne Fox, an associate professor of fisheries at Delaware State University, sits on a committee at his school that reviews job applicants. One recent applicant, he recalled, listed 50 publications in such journals and is on the editorial boards of some of them. A few years ago, he said, no one would have noticed. But now he and others on search committees at his university have begun scrutinizing the publications closely to see if the journals are legitimate. \"If something gets published in one of these journals and it’s complete garbage, it can develop a life of its own,\" Dr. Fox said. \"Think about human medicine and how much is on the line. When people publish something that is not replicable, it can have health impacts.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/science/predatory-journals-academics.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'When the Make-Believe World Is All Too Real', 'text': ' For my son Jonas’s first Halloween, when he was 5 months old, I dressed the two of us as matching lumberjacks. For the second, we were characters from the movie \"Up.\" I was Carl, the old man, my wife was Ellie, and Jonas was Russell, the enthusiastic Wilderness Explorer. We tied a dozen balloons to our bulldog’s collar, to make him the house. In our version, the wife didn’t die at the beginning of the movie, and we all lived happily ever after. The next Halloween, Jonas wanted to be an elephant. He loved the scene in \"The Jungle Book\" where Mowgli tries to march with the elephants. We resisted, since we like family costumes and didn’t want to buy three elephant outfits, but conceded. We displayed his elephant costume in his room the week before Halloween so he could look at it in anticipation of the big day. My wife, Giulia, wasn’t there for the lumberjack Halloween. She was in the hospital. Giulia was there for the \"Up\" Halloween. But as we approached the elephant Halloween, I suspected she wasn’t going to dress up. Because, once again, she was going psychotic. Giulia was 27 when the first psychotic episode happened. It came out of nowhere. She got nervous about her new job; she lost her appetite; she stopped sleeping; she began having delusions. The first delusions were encouraging. She said she spoke to God, who told her that she was going to be fine. Giulia had never been very religious, so I was alarmed, but at least she was hearing things that were comforting. But then the delusions turned on her. The voices said she wasn’t going to make it, there was no point in even trying, she was better off not being here. That’s how she ended up in the hospital the first time. They gave her medication. The delusions eventually went away. She was depressed for a long time afterward. They gave her more medication, and then she got better. Our son was 5 months old when the second episode happened, just as unexpected as the first. My wife was on medication, she was seeing a therapist, everyone thought that the psychosis was a one-time thing, but it still happened, right on the eve of Halloween. They now called it bipolar disorder. I took my son out to explore the neighborhood in our improvised lumberjack outfits. I read somewhere, maybe in a pamphlet from the hospital or on a forum online, that you shouldn’t engage a psychotic person’s delusions. Talking about the delusions might breathe more life into them, and will only get the person more agitated. Acknowledgment of the surreal is akin to nurturing it. So when my wife was in the hospital for the second time, and found it reassuring to talk about her idea that heaven was a place on earth, I changed the subject. Her delusion was pleasant, but it wasn’t real. And yet, as a parent, I love imagination. I constantly make believe with my son, to make the world more exciting and interesting. There’s Fred the Friendly Coyote, whom we sometimes hear at night in the hills nearby; the monster broom in our closet to sweep the scary monsters out of the house; the tree on our favorite hike where we leave acorns wrapped up in leaves for the friendly forest monster Totoro. In my vision of parenting, the laws of logic, gravity and time don’t matter — all that matters is that the world feels safe and loving for our son. Which I guess is a way of saying that heaven should be a place on earth. The third episode of psychosis crept in slowly. It began the same, with a loss of appetite, sleeplessness and anxiety, but we tried to avoid taking Giulia to the hospital. We thought maybe she could ride it out at home. But the night before Halloween, long after Jonas had fallen asleep, our plan came crashing down. Giulia’s psychosis pulled her in different directions — first, she said I was dangerous and needed to get away; then, she was the dangerous one. I called the hospital and they said they wanted to admit her. Giulia was calm, resigned to the fate of a third hospitalization, but I felt so torn. Her focus this time was on the interconnectedness of all life on earth, a beautiful concept, one I too believe in. I was taking her to the hospital because of an idea I wanted to pass on to our son. But the way Giulia fixated on the idea and spoke of it over and over again made it clear she wasn’t well. I spent all day at the hospital, until I had to leave to take Jonas trick-or-treating. Thankfully I tagged along with other families, because I couldn’t muster the effort to match his energy. We went home and fell asleep on the couch in front of the TV. Jonas was still in his costume. The next morning, Jonas and I got dressed and took our dog out for a hike to our favorite tree. We gathered acorns and leaves along the way, so we could leave them as gifts for Totoro. In the Japanese anime movie, Totoro comforts two young girls whose mom is in the hospital. They exchange acorns as a sign of their affection. This morning, more than any other, I needed Totoro to wrap Jonas and me in a cocoon of protection and affection. So we went out to offer acorns for a friendly forest monster that doesn’t exist. It’s been three years since Giulia was last hospitalized. We have never known why her illness recurred at Halloween. Jonas is 5 now — he is dressing up as Harry Potter this year. I’ve continued to try to build a world with him where he feels included and comforted, even though I know that the world can be anything but. I put on costumes, and invent magical creatures, all in the aim of building that sense of safety for him. We hope that psychosis never returns for Giulia. It’s a terrible, disorienting experience, and I’m relieved that we know which medications help her weather that storm. But if it does, I’m going to listen to her more as she wrestles with her conflicting thoughts. Maybe there’s more that I can do than just shutting down the things that aren’t real. Maybe just as the make-believe world is a place of delight and refuge for Jonas, there’s something profound or even helpful in what Giulia envisions. Maybe.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/well/family/when-the-make-believe-world-is-all-too-real.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Outsmarting Our Primitive Responses to Fear', 'text': ' What scares you? Terrorism? Climate change? Snakes? Germs? Whether it makes you buy a handgun or hand sanitizer, an electric car or an electric fence, fear drives much of human behavior. And it’s not just fear of physical harm that makes us want to hide under the covers. The twin fears of intimacy and rejection, for example, shape many of our social interactions. Scientists say fear and its companion — the fight, flight or freeze response — can save us when faced with imminent physical harm. This served us well when we were cave dwellers, under constant threat from marauding wild animals or invading warrior tribes. But it can often get in our way in modern life. \"Change has occurred so rapidly for our species that now we are equipped with brains that are super sensitive to threat but also super capable of planning, thinking, forecasting and looking ahead,\" said Ahmad Hariri, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University. \"So we essentially drive ourselves nuts worrying about things because we have too much time and don’t have many real threats on our survival, so fear gets expressed in these really strange, maladaptive ways.\" Dr. Hariri studies the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure that has been called the seat of fear (there’s one in each hemisphere of the brain). But it’s really the seat of anticipation. The amygdala primes you to react — your pulse quickens, your muscles tense and your pupils dilate — even before other parts of your brain can figure out if you need to be scared or not. We are particularly sensitive to anything new, other people’s fearful facial expressions, or anything that resembles something that harmed us in the past. It’s why you jump when you sense rustling in the bushes before realizing it’s just your neighbor’s cat. That reflex can save your life in certain circumstances such as leaping out of the way of an oncoming car. Trouble starts when you can’t tamp down your amygdala’s response, which makes you obsess and perhaps do counterproductive things when faced with concerning but not life-threatening events like the Equifax hack or a vulnerable social situation like asking someone out on a date. Consciously activating the more measured, analytical part of your brain is the key to controlling runaway fear and anxiety. But it’s not so easy in an era when social media and cable news make us aware of every actual or potential disaster occurring anywhere in the world (and in a repeating loop). It’s even more difficult if you have lots of stress or instability at home or work. To your primitive mind, it’s as if there are lions and tigers lurking around every corner. The result is often a juiced-up amygdala more apt to flip you into fight, flight or freeze mode in response to even the slightest concern, and keep you there, rather than return you to a state of calm in the absence of clear and present danger. Remaining in this state of wary hypervigilance can contribute to issues like social anxiety, hypochondria, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and all manner of phobias. It also plays a role in racial and religious intolerance because fearful people are more inclined to cling to the familiar and denigrate the unfamiliar. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly 18 percent of the United States population is afflicted with persistent, outsized fear responses to seemingly ordinary stimuli. Arresting an overactive amygdala requires first realizing and then admitting you’re feeling uneasy and scared. \"Our culture valorizes strength and power and showing fear is considered weakness,\" said Leon Hoffman, co-director of the Pacella Research Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute in Manhattan. \"But you are actually stronger if you can acknowledge fear.\" That’s how it was for Sean Tucker, a pilot who for 40 years has performed heart-stopping aerobatic stunts at air shows despite an almost paralyzing fear of crashing. \"I never told anyone how scared I was when I started flying,\" Mr. Tucker said. \"But what I learned was that fear turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy and if you have the courage to admit it, you’ll be able to focus and prepare and rise above it.\" If you can sense and appreciate your fear — be it of flying, illness or social rejection — as merely your amygdala’s request for more information rather than a signal of impending doom, then you are on your way to calming down and engaging more conscious, logic-dominated parts of your brain. At that point, you can assess the rationality of your fear and take steps to deal with it. \"The more you try to suppress fear, either by ignoring it or doing something else to displace it, the more you will actually experience it,\" said Kristy Dalrymple, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Alpert Medical School of Brown University. Dr. Dalrymple is a proponent of acceptance and commitment therapy for managing fear, which has recently been gaining clinical validation. It encourages people not only to accept that they are feeling fearful and examine the causes but also to think about their values and how committing to overcoming their fears would be consistent with who they want to be. The approach forces higher-order thinking, which theoretically disables or diminishes the amygdala response. The classical pianist Emanuel Ax, whose career demands that he perform in front of thousands of people, has long struggled with stage fright. He didn’t go to a psychotherapist, but it seems that the strategies of acceptance and commitment are how he manages his fear. \"I’m still scared, but I’ve learned to accept that I’m going to be nervous,\" Mr. Ax said. \"Aside from being what I love to do, playing the piano is my employment and gives people pleasure. I wouldn’t be doing my job if I gave in.\" Psychologists and neuroscientists are also finding that the amygdala is less apt to freak out if you are reminded that you are loved or could be loved. For example, seeing images of people with frightened expressions is usually a huge trigger for the amygdala, but that response is greatly diminished when subjects are first shown pictures of people being cared for or hugged. Just as fear can be contagious, so can courage, caring and calm.', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/well/live/fear-anxiety-therapy.html?ref=todayspaper'}, {'title': 'Should I Get Revaccinated as an Adult?', 'text': ' Q. Is there any benefit to revaccinating adults against measles, mumps, whooping cough and other diseases making a comeback? A. Yes, there are some vaccinations that are recommended for adults, to protect themselves or infants too young for vaccination. A student at a college with a mumps outbreak, for example, may be asked to get revaccinated to increase protection, because immunity wanes over time, said Dr. Amanda Cohn, a pediatrician and senior adviser for vaccines at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In adulthood, mumps can cause severely swollen glands and testicles as well as aseptic meningitis, which produces such symptoms as fever, headache, stiff neck and vomiting. The mumps part of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is the weak link, said Dr. Cody Meissner, chief of pediatric infectious disease at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and a member of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, which advises the federal government. \"We could use a better mumps vaccine,\" he said, though there’s unlikely to be a new one because of the economics of vaccine development. With measles, anyone who was born after 1957 and received two doses of the measles vaccine in childhood should have lifelong protection, said Dr. Matthew Leibowitz, chief of infectious diseases at Newton-Wellesley Hospital outside Boston. People who are unsure whether they got two shots in childhood should get revaccinated if they are traveling to areas where measles is common, including South America, Asia or Africa, he said. Most Americans who get measles now are unvaccinated or under-vaccinated, Dr. Cohn said, because they grew up in a country where vaccination was not required, chose not to be vaccinated, are too young for vaccination or have compromised immune systems. Pregnant women are advised to get a vaccine against whooping cough (also known as pertussis, and delivered with a diphtheria and tetanus vaccine) during the third trimester of every pregnancy. That way, their newborn will be protected against the disease during the earliest months of life when it is most dangerous and before it is safe to vaccinate, Dr. Cohn said. The father and close relatives should also be revaccinated, Dr. Meissner said, to provide \"cocooning around the infant,\" because the disease is now so common and adults might not be aware that they have it. Other vaccinations recommended for adults include an annual flu shot, a tetanus booster every 10 years, the shingles vaccine and the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine. Do you have a health question?

In 2006, the E.P.A. reduced the arsenic maximum in public water systems to 10 micrograms per liter, from the previous level of 50 micrograms. The rule does not apply to private wells. Using data from a continuing nationwide health survey, researchers compared urinary arsenic levels in 2003, before the new rule went into effect, with those in 2014, after it had been fully implemented. There were 14,127 participants in the study, and the scientists adjusted for arsenic contributions from tobacco and dietary sources. The report is in Lancet Public Health. They found a 17 percent reduction in arsenic levels among those using public water systems. The researchers estimate that the new rule resulted in 200 to 900 fewer lung and bladder cancers and 50 fewer skin cancers annually. The senior author, Dr. Ana Navas-Acien, a professor of environmental health sciences at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said that water treatment to remove arsenic is expensive and a challenge for smaller cities. \"We are trying to provide information in a way that’s useful for policymakers,\" she said. \"If we could eliminate arsenic entirely, it would be ideal.

This study, in Human Reproduction, followed 78,759 premenopausal women ages 25 to 42 beginning in 1989. Over the following 22 years, 2,804 of them reported natural menopause before age 45. After controlling for smoking, pregnancies, oral contraceptive use and other factors, they found that compared with women who had a body mass index of 18.5 to 22.4 (within the normal range), those with a B.M.I. under 18.5 at any age had a 30 percent increased risk of early menopause. Overweight women (B.M.I. 25 to 34.9) had a slightly lower risk of early menopause, and there was no significant increased risk in very obese women with a B.M.I. higher than 35. The lead author, Kathleen L. Szegda, who was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, when the work was done, said the reasons for the link between weight and the timing of menopause are unclear and that more research is needed to replicate these results. Still, she said, \"Underweight women may want to discuss the findings with their doctors.

Department of Health on gifts from pharmaceutical and medical device companies given to providers in 2013. The study, in PLOS One, found that 39.1 percent of prescribers received gifts ranging in value from $7 to $200,000, while the rest received none. Health care providers given gifts wrote an average of 892 prescriptions compared with 389 for those who accepted none. The average cost of a prescription was $135 for gift recipients and $85 for the others. Gift recipients chose the brand-name drug a third of the time, compared with a quarter of the time for non- recipients. Any gift was associated with higher cost prescriptions, but the larger gifts had an even greater effect. Those who received gifts worth more than $500 during the year averaged $189 per prescription.

Having, temporarily at least, released the muscle tension that aggravates my back and hip pain, I felt like I was walking on air. I had long refrained from writing about this method of countering pain because I thought it was some sort of New Age gobbledygook with no scientific basis. Boy, was I wrong! The Feldenkrais method is one of several increasingly popular movement techniques, similar to the Alexander technique, that attempt to better integrate the connections between mind and body. By becoming aware of how one’s body interacts with its surroundings and learning how to behave in less stressful ways, it becomes possible to relinquish habitual movement patterns that cause or contribute to chronic pain. The method was developed by Moshe Feldenkrais, an Israeli physicist, mechanical engineer and expert in martial arts, after a knee injury threatened to leave him unable to walk. Relying on his expert knowledge of gravity and the mechanics of motion, he developed exercises to help teach the body easier, more efficient ways to move. I went to the institute at the urging of Cathryn Jakobson Ramin, author of the recently published book \"Crooked\" that details the nature and results of virtually every current approach to treating back pain, a problem that has plagued me on and off (now mostly on) for decades. Having benefited from Feldenkrais lessons herself, Ms. Ramin had good reason to believe they would help me. In her book, she recounts the experience of Courtney King, who first experienced crippling back spasms in her late 20s. Ms. King was taking several dance classes a week and practicing yoga, and she thought the stress of these activities might be causing the pain in her tight, inflexible back. But after a number of Feldenkrais sessions, she told Ms. Ramin, \"I realized that the pain had more to do with the way I carried myself every day.\" Even after just one session, I understood what she meant. When I make a point of walking upright and fluid, sitting straight, even cooking relaxed and unhurried, I have no pain. The slow, gentle, repetitive movements I practiced in a Feldenkrais group class helped foster an awareness of how I use my body in relation to my environment, and awareness is the first step to changing one’s behavior. One common problem of which I’m often guilty is using small muscles to accomplish tasks meant for large, heavy-duty ones, resulting in undue fatigue and pain. The group class, called Awareness Through Movement, was followed by an individual session called Functional Integration with a therapist that helped to free tight muscles and joints that were limiting my motion and increasing my discomfort. Using gentle manipulation and passive movements, the therapist individualized his approach to my particular needs. The ultimate goal of both sessions is, in effect, to retrain the brain – to establish new neural pathways that result in easy, simple movements that are physiologically effective and comfortable. Although the Feldenkrais method was developed in the mid-20th century, neurophysiologists have since demonstrated the plasticity of the brain, its ability to form new cells, reorganize itself and, in effect, learn new ways to do things. The beauty of Feldenkrais lessons is that they are both relatively low-cost (group classes average $15 to $25, individual sessions $100 to $200) and potentially accessible to nearly everyone. There are more than 7,000 teachers and practitioners working in 18 countries, including large numbers in the United States. You can be any age, strength, fitness level and state of well-being to participate. The exercises are slow, gentle and adjustable to whatever might ail you. Their calming effect counters the stress that results in contracted muscles, tightness and pain. Feldenkrais practitioners like Marek Wyszynski, director of the New York center, typically start professional life as physical therapists. They then undergo three years of training to become certified in the Feldenkrais method. Mr. Wyszynski explained that he starts by observing how patients are using their skeletons – how they sit, stand and walk in ways that may cause or contribute to their pathology, be it spinal disc disease, arthritis, shoulder pain or damaged knee joints. In accordance with Dr. Feldenkrais’s astute observation, \"If you don’t know what you are doing, you can’t do what you want,\" patients are then given a clear sensory experience of how their posture and behavior contribute to their pain and physical limitations. For example, some people may use excessive force, clench their teeth, hold their breath or rush, causing undue muscle tension and skeletal stress. Years ago, I realized that my frequent headaches resulted from an unconscious habit of clenching my jaw when I concentrated intently on a task like sewing or cooking. Feldenkrais teachers do not give formulas for a proper way of behaving; rather, they rely on their patients’ ability to self-discover and self-correct. Once aware of their counterproductive habits, students are given the opportunity to experience alternative movements, postures and behaviors and, through practice, create new habits that are less likely to cause pain. Mr. Wyszynski told me that there are more than 1,000 distinct Feldenkrais lessons currently available, most of which involve everyday actions like reaching, getting up from a chair, turning, bending and walking. As a mechanical engineer and physicist, Dr. Feldenkrais understood that the job of the human skeleton was to accommodate the effects of gravity in order to remain upright. And he wanted people to achieve this in the most efficient way possible. Using two tall foam cylinders, one perched on top of the other, Mr. Wyszynski demonstrated a guiding principle of the Feldenkrais method. When the top cylinder was centered on the bottom one, it stood in place without assistance. But when it was off center, perched near the edge of the bottom cylinder, it tipped over. If instead of cylinders these were someone’s skeletal parts that were askew, tightened muscles would have to keep the patient from falling over. As Mr. Wyszynski explained, \"Good posture allows the skeleton to hold up and support the body without expending unnecessary energy despite the pull of gravity. However, with poor posture, the muscles are doing part of the job of the bones, and with poor skeletal support, the muscles have to remain contracted to prevent the body from falling.\"', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/well/trying-the-feldenkrais-method-for-chronic-pain.html?ref=todayspaper'}]}\n"
